"the transport properties of nonlinear non - equilibrium dynamical systems are far from well - understood@xcite . 
 consider in particular so - called ratchet systems which are asymmetric periodic potentials where an ensemble of particles experience directed transport@xcite . 
 the origins of the interest in this lie in considerations about extracting useful work from unbiased noisy fluctuations as seems to happen in biological systems@xcite . 
 recently attention has been focused on the behavior of deterministic chaotic ratchets@xcite as well as hamiltonian ratchets@xcite . 
 chaotic systems are defined as those which are sensitively dependent on initial conditions . whether chaotic or not , the behavior of nonlinear systems  including the transition from regular to chaotic behavior  is in general sensitively dependent on the parameters of the system . 
 that is , the phase - space structure is usually relatively complicated , consisting of stability islands embedded in chaotic seas , for examples , or of simultaneously co - existing attractors . 
 this can change significantly as parameters change . 
 for example , stability islands can merge into each other , or break apart , and the chaotic sea itself may get pinched off or otherwise changed , or attractors can change symmetry or bifurcate . 
 this means that the transport properties can change dramatically as well . 
 a few years ago , mateos@xcite considered a specific ratchet model with a periodically forced underdamped particle . 
 he looked at an ensemble of particles , specifically the velocity for the particles , averaged over time and the entire ensemble . 
 he showed that this quantity , which is an intuitively reasonable definition of ` the current ' , could be either positive or negative depending on the amplitude @xmath0 of the periodic forcing for the system . at the same time , there exist ranges in @xmath0 where the trajectory of an individual particle displays chaotic dynamics . 
 mateos conjectured a connection between these two phenomena , specifically that the reversal of current direction was correlated with a bifurcation from chaotic to periodic behavior in the trajectory dynamics . 
 even though it is unlikely that such a result would be universally valid across all chaotic deterministic ratchets , it would still be extremely useful to have general heuristic rules such as this . 
 these organizing principles would allow some handle on characterizing the many different kinds of behavior that are possible in such systems . 
 a later investigation@xcite of the mateos conjecture by barbi and salerno , however , argued that it was not a valid rule even in the specific system considered by mateos . 
 they presented results showing that it was possible to have current reversals in the absence of bifurcations from periodic to chaotic behavior . 
 they proposed an alternative origin for the current reversal , suggesting it was related to the different stability properties of the rotating periodic orbits of the system . 
 these latter results seem fundamentally sensible . however , this paper based its arguments about currents on the behavior of a _ single _ particle as opposed to an ensemble . 
 this implicitly assumes that the dynamics of the system are ergodic . 
 this is not true in general for chaotic systems of the type being considered . in particular , there can be extreme dependence of the result on the statistics of the ensemble being considered . 
 this has been pointed out in earlier studies  @xcite which laid out a detailed methodology for understanding transport properties in such a mixed regular and chaotic system . depending on specific parameter value , the particular system under consideration has multiple coexisting periodic or chaotic attractors or a mixture of both . 
 it is hence appropriate to understand how a probability ensemble might behave in such a system . 
 the details of the dependence on the ensemble are particularly relevant to the issue of the possible experimental validation of these results , since experiments are always conducted , by virtue of finite - precision , over finite time and finite ensembles . 
 it is therefore interesting to probe the results of barbi and salerno with regard to the details of the ensemble used , and more formally , to see how ergodicity alters our considerations about the current , as we do in this paper . 
 we report here on studies on the properties of the current in a chaotic deterministic ratchet , specifically the same system as considered by mateos@xcite and barbi and salerno@xcite . 
 we consider the impact of different kinds of ensembles of particles on the current and show that the current depends significantly on the details of the initial ensemble . 
 we also show that it is important to discard transients in quantifying the current . 
 this is one of the central messages of this paper : broad heuristics are rare in chaotic systems , and hence it is critical to understand the ensemble - dependence in any study of the transport properties of chaotic ratchets . 
 having established this , we then proceed to discuss the connection between the bifurcation diagram for individual particles and the behavior of the current . 
 we find that while we disagree with many of the details of barbi and salerno s results , the broader conclusion still holds . 
 that is , it is indeed possible to have current reversals in the absence of bifurcations from chaos to periodic behavior as well as bifurcations without any accompanying current reversals . 
 the result of our investigation is therefore that the transport properties of a chaotic ratchet are not as simple as the initial conjecture . 
 however , we do find evidence for a generalized version of mateos s conjecture . 
 that is , in general , bifurcations for trajectory dynamics as a function of system parameter seem to be associated with abrupt changes in the current . 
 depending on the specific value of the current , these abrupt changes may lead the net current to reverse direction , but not necessarily so . 
 we start below with a preparatory discussion necessary to understand the details of the connection between bifurcations and current reversal , where we discuss the potential and phase - space for single trajectories for this system , where we also define a bifurcation diagram for this system . in the next section , 
 we discuss the subtleties of establishing a connection between the behavior of individual trajectories and of ensembles . 
 after this , we are able to compare details of specific trajectory bifurcation curves with current curves , and thus justify our broader statements above , after which we conclude . 
 the goal of these studies is to understand the behavior of general chaotic ratchets . 
 the approach taken here is that to discover heuristic rules we must consider specific systems in great detail before generalizing . 
 we choose the same @xmath1-dimensional ratchet considered previously by mateos@xcite , as well as barbi and salerno@xcite . 
 we consider an ensemble of particles moving in an asymmetric periodic potential , driven by a periodic time - dependent external force , where the force has a zero time - average . 
 there is no noise in the system , so it is completely deterministic , although there is damping . 
 the equations of motion for an individual trajectory for such a system are given in dimensionless variables by @xmath2 where the periodic asymmetric potential can be written in the form @xmath3 + \frac{1}{4 } \sin [ 4\pi ( x -x_0 ) ] \bigg ] .\ ] ] in this equation @xmath4 have been introduced for convenience such that one potential minimum exists at the origin with @xmath5 and the term @xmath6 . 
 ( a ) classical phase space for the unperturbed system . for @xmath7 , @xmath8 , 
 two chaotic attractors emerge with @xmath9 ( b ) @xmath10 ( c ) and a period four attractor consisting of the four centers of the circles with @xmath11.,title=""fig:"",width=302 ]    the phase - space of the undamped undriven ratchet  the system corresponding to the unperturbed potential @xmath12  looks like a series of asymmetric pendula . 
 that is , individual trajectories have one of following possible time - asymptotic behaviors : ( i ) inside the potential wells , trajectories and all their properties oscillate , leading to zero net transport . outside the wells , the trajectories either ( ii ) librate to the right or ( iii ) to the left , with corresponding net transport depending upon initial conditions . 
 there are also ( iv ) trajectories on the separatrices between the oscillating and librating orbits , moving between unstable fixed points in infinite time , as well as the unstable and stable fixed points themselves , all of which constitute a set of negligible measure .    when damping is introduced via the @xmath13-dependent term in eq . 
 [ eq : dyn ] , it makes the stable fixed points the only attractors for the system . 
 when the driving is turned on , the phase - space becomes chaotic with the usual phenomena of intertwining separatrices and resulting homoclinic tangles . 
 the dynamics of individual trajectories in such a system are now very complicated in general and depend sensitively on the choice of parameters and initial conditions . 
 we show snapshots of the development of this kind of chaos in the set of poincar sections fig . 
 ( [ figure1]b , c ) together with a period - four orbit represented by the center of the circles .    a broad characterization of the dynamics of the problem as a function of a parameter ( @xmath14 or @xmath15 ) emerges in a bifurcation diagram 
 . this can be constructed in several different and essentially equivalent ways . 
 the relatively standard form that we use proceeds as follows : first choose the bifurcation parameter ( let us say @xmath0 ) and correspondingly choose fixed values of @xmath16 , and start with a given value for @xmath17 . 
 now iterate an initial condition , recording the value of the particle s position @xmath18 at times @xmath19 from its integrated trajectory ( sometimes we record @xmath20 . 
 this is done stroboscopically at discrete times @xmath21 where @xmath22 and @xmath23 is an integer @xmath24 with @xmath25 the maximum number of observations made . of these , discard observations at times less than some cut - off time @xmath26 and plot the remaining points against @xmath27 . 
 it must be noted that discarding transient behavior is critical to get results which are independent of initial condition , and we shall emphasize this further below in the context of the net transport or current . 
 if the system has a fixed - point attractor then all of the data lie at one particular location @xmath28 . a periodic orbit with period @xmath29 ( that is , with period commensurate with the driving ) shows up with @xmath30 points occupying only @xmath31 different locations of @xmath32 for @xmath27 . 
 all other orbits , including periodic orbits of incommensurate period result in a simply - connected or multiply - connected dense set of points . for the next value @xmath33 , the last computed value of @xmath34 at @xmath35 are used as initial conditions , and previously , results are stored after cutoff and so on until @xmath36 . 
 that is , the bifurcation diagram is generated by sweeping the relevant parameter , in this case @xmath0 , from @xmath27 through some maximum value @xmath37 . 
 this procedure is intended to catch all coexisting attractors of the system with the specified parameter range . 
 note that several initial conditions are effectively used troughout the process , and a bifurcation diagram is not the behavior of a single trajectory . 
 we have made several plots , as a test , with different initial conditions and the diagrams obtained are identical . 
 we show several examples of this kind of bifurcation diagram below , where they are being compared with the corresponding behavior of the current . 
 having broadly understood the wide range of behavior for individual trajectories in this system , we now turn in the next section to a discussion of the non - equilibrium properties of a statistical ensemble of these trajectories , specifically the current for an ensemble . 
 the current @xmath38 for an ensemble in the system is defined in an intuitive manner by mateos@xcite as the time - average of the average velocity over an ensemble of initial conditions . 
 that is , an average over several initial conditions is performed at a given observation time @xmath39 to yield the average velocity over the particles @xmath40 this average velocity is then further time - averaged ; given the discrete time @xmath39 for observation this leads to a second sum @xmath41 where @xmath25 is the number of time - observations made .    for this to be a relevant quantity to compare with bifurcation diagrams , @xmath38 should be independent of the quantities @xmath42 but still strongly dependent on @xmath43 . 
 a further parameter dependence that is being suppressed in the definition above is the shape and location of the ensemble being used . 
 that is , the transport properties of an ensemble in a chaotic system depend in general on the part of the phase - space being sampled . 
 it is therefore important to consider many different initial conditions to generate a current . the first straightforward result we show in fig . 
 ( [ figure2 ] ) is that in the case of chaotic trajectories , a single trajectory easily displays behavior very different from that of many trajectories . 
 however , it turns out that in the regular regime , it is possible to use a single trajectory to get essentially the same result as obtained from many trajectories .    further consider the bifurcation diagram in fig . 
 ( [ figure3 ] ) where we superimpose the different curves resulting from varying the number of points in the initial ensemble . 
 first , the curve is significantly smoother as a function of @xmath0 for larger @xmath44 . even more relevant is the fact that the single trajectory data ( @xmath45 ) may show current reversals that do not exist in the large @xmath44 data . 
 current @xmath38 versus the number of trajectories @xmath44 for @xmath7 ; dashed lines correspond to a regular motion with @xmath46 while solid lines correspond to a chaotic motion with @xmath47 . 
 note that a single trajectory is sufficient for a regular motion while the convergence in the chaotic case is only obtained if the @xmath44 exceeds a certain threshold , @xmath48.,title=""fig:"",width=302 ]     current @xmath38 versus @xmath0 for different set of trajectories @xmath44 ; @xmath45 ( circles ) , @xmath49 ( square ) and @xmath50 ( dashed lines ) . note that a single trajectory suffices in the regular regime where all the curves match . in the chaotic regime 
 , as @xmath44 increases , the curves converge towards the dashed one.,title=""fig:"",width=302 ]    also , note that single - trajectory current values are typically significantly greater than ensemble averages . 
 this arises from the fact that an arbitrarily chosen ensemble has particles with idiosyncratic behaviors which often average out . as our result , with these ensembles we see typical @xmath51 for example , while barbi and salerno report currents about @xmath52 times greater . 
 however , it is not true that only a few trajectories dominate the dynamics completely , else there would not be a saturation of the current as a function of @xmath44 . 
 all this is clear in fig . 
 ( [ figure3 ] ) . 
 we note that the * net * drift of an ensemble can be a lot closer to @xmath53 than the behavior of an individual trajectory 
 .    it should also be clear that there is a dependence of the current on the location of the initial ensemble , this being particularly true for small @xmath44 , of course . 
 the location is defined by its centroid @xmath54 . for @xmath45 , it is trivially true that the initial location matters to the asymptotic value of the time - averaged velocity , given that this is a non - ergodic and chaotic system . 
 further , considering a gaussian ensemble , say , the width of the ensemble also affects the details of the current , and can show , for instance , illusory current reversal , as seen in figs . 
 ( [ current - bifur1],[current - bifur2 ] ) for example . 
 notice also that in fig . 
 ( [ current - bifur1 ] ) , at @xmath55 and @xmath56 , the deviations between the different ensembles is particularly pronounced . 
 these points are close to bifurcation points where some sort of symmetry breaking is clearly occuring , which underlines our emphasis on the relevance of specifying ensemble characteristics in the neighborhood of unstable behavior . 
 however , why these specific bifurcations should stand out among all the bifurcations in the parameter range shown is not entirely clear .    to understand how to incorporate this knowledge into calculations of the current , 
 therefore , consider the fact that if we look at the classical phase space for the hamiltonian or underdamped @xmath57 motion , we see the typical structure of stable islands embedded in a chaotic sea which have quite complicated behavior@xcite . in such a situation , the dynamics always depends on the location of the initial conditions . 
 however , we are not in the hamiltonian situation when the damping is turned on  in this case , the phase - space consists in general of attractors . 
 that is , if transient behavior is discarded , the current is less likely to depend significantly on the location of the initial conditions or on the spread of the initial conditions .    in particular , in the chaotic regime of a non - hamiltonian system , the initial ensemble needs to be chosen larger than a certain threshold to ensure convergence . 
 however , in the regular regime , it is not important to take a large ensemble and a single trajectory can suffice , as long as we take care to discard the transients . 
 that is to say , in the computation of currents , the definition of the current needs to be modified to : @xmath58 where @xmath59 is some empirically obtained cut - off such that we get a converged current ( for instance , in our calculations , we obtained converged results with @xmath60 ) . when this modified form is used , the convergence ( ensemble - independence ) is more rapid as a function of @xmath61 and the width of the intial conditions . 
 armed with this background , we are now finally in a position to compare bifurcation diagrams with the current , as we do in the next section . 
 our results are presented in the set of figures fig . 
 ( [ figure5 ] )  fig . 
 ( [ rev - nobifur ] ) , in each of which we plot both the ensemble current and the bifurcation diagram as a function of the parameter @xmath0 . 
 the main point of these numerical results can be distilled into a series of heuristic statements which we state below ; these are labelled with roman numerals .     for @xmath7 and @xmath8 , we plot current ( upper ) with @xmath62 and bifurcation diagram ( lower ) versus @xmath0 . 
 note that there is a * single * current reversal while there are many bifurcations visible in the same parameter range.,title=""fig:"",width=302 ]    consider fig . 
 ( [ figure5 ] ) , which shows the parameter range @xmath63 chosen relatively arbitrarily . in this figure , we see several period - doubling bifurcations leading to order - chaos transitions , such as for example in the approximate ranges @xmath64 . however , there is only one instance of current - reversal , at @xmath65 . 
 note , however , that the current is not without structure  it changes fairly dramatically as a function of parameter . 
 this point is made even more clearly in fig . 
 ( [ figure6 ] ) where the current remains consistently below @xmath53 , and hence there are in fact , no current reversals at all . 
 note again , however , that the current has considerable structure , even while remaining negative 
 .     for @xmath66 and @xmath8 , plotted are current ( upper ) and bifurcation diagram ( lower ) versus @xmath0 with @xmath62 . 
 notice the current stays consistently below @xmath53.,title=""fig:"",width=302 ]     current and bifurcations versus @xmath0 . in ( a ) and ( b ) 
 we show ensemble dependence , specifically in ( a ) the black curve is for an ensemble of trajectories starting centered at the stable fixed point @xmath67 with a root - mean - square gaussian width of @xmath68 , and the brown curve for trajectories starting from the unstable fixed point @xmath69 and of width @xmath68 . in ( b ) , all ensembles are centered at the stable fixed point , the black line for an ensemble of width @xmath68 , brown a width of @xmath70 and maroon with width @xmath71 . 
 ( c ) is the comparison of the current @xmath38 without transients ( black ) and with transients ( brown ) along with the single - trajectory results in blue ( after barbi and salerno ) . 
 the initial conditions for the ensembles are centered at @xmath67 with a mean root square gaussian of width @xmath68 . 
 ( d ) is the corresponding bifurcation diagram.,title=""fig:"",width=302 ]    it is possible to find several examples of this at different parameters , leading to the negative conclusion , therefore , that * ( i ) not all bifurcations lead to current reversal*. however , we are searching for positive correlations , and at this point we have not precluded the more restricted statement that all current reversals are associated with bifurcations , which is in fact mateos conjecture . 
 we therefore now move onto comparing our results against the specific details of barbi and salerno s treatment of this conjecture . in particular , we look at their figs . 
 ( 2,3a,3b ) , where they scan the parameter region @xmath72 . 
 the distinction between their results and ours is that we are using _ 
 ensembles _ of particles , and are investigating the convergence of these results as a function of number of particles @xmath44 , the width of the ensemble in phase - space , as well as transience parameters @xmath73 .    our data with larger @xmath44 yields different results in general , as we show in the recomputed versions of these figures , presented here in figs . 
 ( [ current - bifur1],[current - bifur2 ] ) . 
 specifically , ( a ) the single - trajectory results are , not surprisingly , cleaner and can be more easily interpreted as part of transitions in the behavior of the stability properties of the periodic orbits . 
 the ensemble results on the other hand , even when converged , show statistical roughness . 
 ( b ) the ensemble results are consistent with barbi and salerno in general , although disagreeing in several details . 
 for instance , ( c ) the bifurcation at @xmath74 has a much gentler impact on the ensemble current , which has been growing for a while , while the single - trajectory result changes abruptly . note , ( d ) the very interesting fact that the single - trajectory current completely misses the bifurcation - associated spike at @xmath75 . 
 further , ( e ) the barbi and salerno discussion of the behavior of the current in the range @xmath76 is seen to be flawed 
 our results are consistent with theirs , however , the current changes are seen to be consistent with bifurcations despite their statements to the contrary . on the other hand ( f ) , the ensemble current shows a case [ in fig . 
 ( [ current - bifur2 ] ) , at @xmath77 of current reversal that does not seem to be associated with bifurcations . 
 in this spike , the current abruptly drops below @xmath53 and then rises above it again . 
 the single trajectory current completely ignores this particular effect , as can be seen . 
 the bifurcation diagram indicates that in this case the important transitions happen either before or after the spike . 
 all of this adds up to two statements : the first is a reiteration of the fact that there is significant information in the ensemble current that can not be obtained from the single - trajectory current . 
 the second is that the heuristic that arises from this is again a negative conclusion , that * ( ii ) not all current reversals are associated with bifurcations . 
 * where does this leave us in the search for ` positive ' results , that is , useful heuristics ? 
 one possible way of retaining the mateos conjecture is to weaken it , i.e. make it into the statement that * ( iii ) _ most _ current reversals are associated with bifurcations . *     same as fig . 
 ( [ current - bifur1 ] ) except for the range of @xmath0 considered.,title=""fig:"",width=302 ]     for @xmath78 and @xmath8 , plotted are current ( upper ) and bifurcation diagram ( lower ) versus @xmath0 with @xmath62 . 
 note in particular in this figure that eyeball tests can be misleading . 
 we see reversals without bifurcations in ( a ) whereas the zoomed version ( c ) shows that there are windows of periodic and chaotic regimes . 
 this is further evidence that jumps in the current correspond in general to bifurcation.,title=""fig:"",width=302 ]     for @xmath7 and @xmath79 , current ( upper ) and bifurcation diagram ( lower ) versus @xmath0.,title=""fig:"",width=302 ]    however , a * different * rule of thumb , previously not proposed , emerges from our studies . 
 this generalizes mateos conjecture to say that * ( iv ) bifurcations correspond to sudden current changes ( spikes or jumps)*. note that this means these changes in current are not necessarily reversals of direction . 
 if this current jump or spike goes through zero , this coincides with a current reversal , making the mateos conjecture a special case . 
 the physical basis of this argument is the fact that ensembles of particles in chaotic systems _ can _ have net directed transport but the details of this behavior depends relatively sensitively on the system parameters . 
 this parameter dependence is greatly exaggerated at the bifurcation point , when the dynamics of the underlying single - particle system undergoes a transition  a period - doubling transition , for example , or one from chaos to regular behavior . 
 scanning the relevant figures , we see that this is a very useful rule of thumb . for example 
 , it completely captures the behaviour of fig . 
 ( [ figure6 ] ) which can not be understood as either an example of the mateos conjecture , or even a failure thereof . as such 
 , this rule significantly enhances our ability to characterize changes in the behavior of the current as a function of parameter . 
 a further example of where this modified conjecture helps us is in looking at a seeming negation of the mateos conjecture , that is , an example where we seem to see current - reversal without bifurcation , visible in fig . 
 ( [ hidden - bifur ] ) . 
 the current - reversals in that scan of parameter space seem to happen inside the chaotic regime and seemingly independent of bifurcation . however , this turns out to be a ` hidden ' bifurcation  when we zoom in on the chaotic regime , we see hidden periodic windows . 
 this is therefore consistent with our statement that sudden current changes are associated with bifurcations . 
 each of the transitions from periodic behavior to chaos and back provides opportunities for the current to spike . 
 however , in not all such cases can these hidden bifurcations be found . 
 we can see an example of this in fig . 
 ( [ rev - nobifur ] ) . 
 the current is seen to move smoothly across @xmath80 with seemingly no corresponding bifurcations , even when we do a careful zoom on the data , as in fig . 
 ( [ hidden - bifur ] ) . 
 however , arguably , although subjective , this change is close to the bifurcation point . 
 this result , that there are situations where the heuristics simply do not seem to apply , are part of the open questions associated with this problem , of course . 
 we note , however , that we have seen that these broad arguments hold when we vary other parameters as well ( figures not shown here ) .    in conclusion , 
 in this paper we have taken the approach that it is useful to find general rules of thumb ( even if not universally valid ) to understand the complicated behavior of non - equilibrium nonlinear statistical mechanical systems . in the case of chaotic deterministic ratchets 
 , we have shown that it is important to factor out issues of size , location , spread , and transience in computing the ` current ' due to an ensemble before we search for such rules , and that the dependence on ensemble characteristics is most critical near certain bifurcation points . 
 we have then argued that the following heuristic characteristics hold : bifurcations in single - trajectory behavior often corresponds to sudden spikes or jumps in the current for an ensemble in the same system . 
 current reversals are a special case of this 
 . however , not all spikes or jumps correspond to a bifurcation , nor vice versa . 
 the open question is clearly to figure out if the reason for when these rules are violated or are valid can be made more concrete .

 e  * 66 * , 041104 ( 2002 )","in 84 , 258 ( 2000 ) , mateos conjectured that current reversal in a classical deterministic ratchet is associated with bifurcations from chaotic to periodic regimes . 
 this is based on the comparison of the current and the bifurcation diagram as a function of a given parameter for a periodic asymmetric potential . 
 barbi and salerno , in 62 , 1988 ( 2000 ) , have further investigated this claim and argue that , contrary to mateos claim , current reversals can occur also in the absence of bifurcations . 
 barbi and salerno s studies are based on the dynamics of one particle rather than the statistical mechanics of an ensemble of particles moving in the chaotic system . 
 the behavior of ensembles can be quite different , depending upon their characteristics , which leaves their results open to question . in this paper we present results from studies showing how the current depends on the details of the ensemble 
 used to generate it , as well as conditions for convergent behavior ( that is , independent of the details of the ensemble ) . 
 we are then able to present the converged current as a function of parameters , in the same system as mateos as well as barbi and salerno . 
 we show evidence for current reversal without bifurcation , as well as bifurcation without current reversal . 
 we conjecture that it is appropriate to correlate abrupt changes in the current with bifurcation , rather than current reversals , and show numerical evidence for our claims .",arxiv
"one surprising result that has come out of the more than 200 extrasolar planet discoveries to date is the wide range of eccentricities observed . unlike our own solar system 
 , many of the extrasolar planets which are not tidally locked to their host stars have moderate eccentricities ( @xmath1 ) , and 15 planets have high eccentricities ( @xmath0 ) . 
 these observations have spawned several theories as to the origin of highly eccentric extrasolar planets . 
 one such method , planet - planet scattering , occurs when multiple jovian planets form several astronomical units ( au ) from the host star and then interact , leaving one in an eccentric orbit and often ejecting the other @xcite . 
 this method has been proposed to explain the architecture of the @xmath2 and planetary system @xcite , which contains a hot jupiter as well as two jovian planets in moderately eccentric orbits . 
 @xcite suggested a merger scenario in which inner protoplanets perturb each other and merge to form a single massive , eccentric planet with @xmath3 and @xmath4 au . 
 interactions with stellar companions are another possible way to boost a planet s eccentricity . 
 of the 15 stars hosting a planet with @xmath0 , six are also known to possess stellar - mass companions in wide binary orbits : hd  3651 @xcite , hd  20782 @xcite , hd  80606 , hd  89744 @xcite , 16  cyg  b , and hd  222582 @xcite . 
 if the inclination angle between the planetary orbit and a stellar companion is large , the kozai mechanism @xcite can induce large - amplitude oscillations in the eccentricity of the planet ( e.g.  malmberg et al . 
 these oscillations can be damped by general relativistic effects and by interaction with other planets , and hence are most effective in systems with a single planet in an orbit @xmath51  au from the host star @xcite . 
 the kozai mechanism has been suggested to explain the high eccentricity of 16  cyg  bb @xcite and hd  80606b @xcite . 
 @xcite found the inclination of 16  cyg  b orbiting the system barycenter to lie between 100 and 160 degrees , where 90 degrees is an edge - on orientation . 
 however , it is the difference in inclination between the orbital planes of the planetary and stellar companion that is critical in determining the importance of the kozai mechanism , and the inclination of the planet s orbit is generally not known for non - transiting systems .    of the 192 known planetary systems , 23 ( 12% ) 
 are multi - planet systems . 
 recent discoveries of additional objects in systems known to host at least one planet @xcite suggest that multiple - planet systems are common . 
 of particular interest are systems which host a jovian planet and a low - mass `` hot neptune , '' e.g.  55  cnc ( = hd  75732 ) , gj  876 , @xmath6 arae ( = hd  160691 ) , gl  777a ( = hd  190360 ) . motivated by the discoveries of hot neptunes in known planetary systems , we have undertaken an intensive survey of selected single - planet systems to search for additional low - mass companions . 
 three of the planetary systems discussed in this paper ( hd  3651 , hd  80606 , hd  89744 ) are part of this campaign . 
 the excellent radial - velocity precision of the high resolution spectrograph on the hobby - eberly telescope ( het ) , combined with queue - scheduling , allow us to time the observations in such a way as to minimize phase gaps in the orbit of the known planet , and also to act quickly on potential new planet candidates . 
 the use of the het in this manner is discussed further in @xcite with regard to the discovery of hd  37605b .    in this work 
 , we aim to combine observational limits on additional planets in known planetary systems with dynamical constraints obtained by n - body simulations . 
 the observations address the question : what additional planets are ( or are not ) in these systems ? 
 the dynamical simulations can answer the question : where are additional planets possible ? 
 section  2 describes the observations and the test particle simulations for six highly eccentric planetary systems : hd  3651 , hd  37605 , hd  45350 , hd  80606 , hd  89744 , and 16 
 cyg  b. we have chosen these systems based on two criteria : ( 1 ) each hosts a planet with @xmath0 , and ( 2 ) each has been observed by the planet search programs at mcdonald observatory . in  3 , we present and discuss the results of the updated orbital fits , dynamical simulations , and detection limit computations . 
 five of the six stars considered in this work have been observed with the mcdonald observatory 9.2  m hobby - eberly telescope ( het ) using its high resolution spectrograph ( hrs ) @xcite . 
 a full description of the het planet search program is given in @xcite . 
 for 16  cyg  b , observations from mcdonald observatory were obtained only with the 2.7  m harlan j.  smith ( hjs ) telescope ; the long - term planet search program on this telescope is described in @xcite . 
 all available published data on these systems were combined with our data from mcdonald observatory in the orbit fitting procedures .      to place constraints on the architecture of planetary systems , we would like to know where additional objects can remain in stable orbits in the presence of the known planet(s ) . 
 we performed test particle simulations using swifthal / swift.html . ] 
 @xcite to investigate the dynamical possibility of additional low - mass planets in each of the six systems considered here . 
 low - mass planets can be treated as test particles since the exchange of angular momentum with jovian planets is small . 
 we chose the regularized mixed - variable symplectic integrator ( rmvs3 ) version of swift for its ability to handle close approaches between massless , non - interacting test particles and planets . 
 particles are removed if they are ( 1 ) closer than 1 hill radius to the planet , ( 2 ) closer than 0.05  au to the star , or ( 3 ) farther than 10  au from the star . 
 since the purpose of these simulations is to determine the regions in which additional planets could remain in stable orbits , we set this outer boundary because the current repository of radial - velocity data can not detect objects at such distances . 
 the test particle simulations were set up following the methods used in @xcite , with the exception that only initially circular orbits are considered in this work . for each planetary system , 
 test particles were placed in initially circular orbits spaced every 0.002  au in the region between 0.05 - 2.0  au . 
 we have chosen to focus on this region because the duration of our high - precision het data is currently only 2 - 4 years for the objects in this study . 
 the test particles were coplanar with the existing planet , which had the effect of confining the simulation to two dimensions . 
 input physical parameters for the known planet in each system were obtained from our keplerian orbit fits described in   3.1 , and from recent literature for 16  cyg  b @xcite and hd  45350 @xcite . 
 the planetary masses were taken to be their minimum values ( sin  @xmath7 ) . 
 the systems were integrated for @xmath8 yr , following @xcite and allowing completion of the computations in a reasonable time . 
 we observed that nearly all of the test - particle removals occurred within the first @xmath9 yr ; after this time , the simulations had essentially stabilized to their final configurations . 
 we present updated keplerian orbital solutions for hd  3651b , hd  37605b , hd  80606b , and hd  89744b in table  1 . 
 a summary of the data used in our analysis is given in table  2 , and the het radial velocities are given in tables  3 - 6 . 
 the velocity uncertainties given for the het data represent internal errors only , and do not include any external sources of error such as stellar `` jitter . '' 
 the parameters for the remaining two planets , hd  45350b and 16  cyg  bb , are taken from @xcite and @xcite , respectively . 
 radial velocity measurements from the het are given for hd  45350 in @xcite , and velocities for 16  cyg  b from the hjs telescope are given in @xcite . 
 as in @xcite , all available published data were combined with those from mcdonald , and the known planet in each system was fit with a keplerian orbit using gaussfit @xcite , allowing the velocity offset between each data set to be a free parameter . 
 examination of the residuals to our keplerian orbit fits revealed no evidence for additional objects in any of the six systems in this study . 
 the saturn - mass ( m  sin  @xmath10 ) planet hd  3651b was discovered by @xcite using observations from lick and keck . 
 we fit these data , which were updated in @xcite , in combination with observations from the hjs and het at mcdonald observatory . 
 the het data , which consist of multiple exposures per visit , were binned using the inverse - variance weighted mean value of the velocities in each visit . 
 the standard error of the mean was added in quadrature to the weighted rms about the mean velocity to generate the error bar of each binned point ( n=29 ) . 
 the rms about the combined fit for each dataset is : lick & keck6.6 , het9.4 , hjs12.2 . 
 the fitted orbital parameters for hd  3651b are of comparable precision to those reported in @xcite , and agree within 2@xmath11 . 
 the recent discovery of a t dwarf companion to hd  3651 @xcite prompts an interesting exercise : can the radial - velocity trend due to this object be detected in the residuals after removing the planet ? 
 we detect a slope of @xmath12  yr@xmath13 , indicating that we are indeed able to discern a trend which is possibly due to the binary companion . 
 however , the reduced @xmath14 of the orbital solution is not significantly improved by the inclusion of a linear trend ( @xmath15=0.18 ) . 
 the parameters given in table  1 were obtained from the fit which did not include a trend . 
 we present 23 new het observations for hd  37605 obtained since its announcement by @xcite . 
 the data now span a total of 1065  days . 
 the best fit is obtained by including an acceleration of @xmath16  yr@xmath13 , indicating a distant orbiting body . 
 such a finding would lend support to the hypothesis that very eccentric single - planet systems originate by interactions within a wide binary system . 
 the shortest period that this outer companion could have and still remain consistent with the observed acceleration and its uncertainty over the timespan of the observations is about 40  yr , assuming a circular orbit . 
 this object would then have a minimum mass in the brown dwarf range 
 .    the planet orbiting hd  80606 , first announced by @xcite , is the most eccentric extrasolar planet known , with @xmath17 ( table  1 ) . 
 we have fit the coralie data in combination with the keck data given in @xcite and 23 observations from het . 
 the extreme velocity variations induced by this planet greatly increase the sensitivity of orbit fits to the weighting of individual measurements . since the uncertainties of the het velocities given in tables  3 - 6 represent internal errors only , we experimented with adding 1 - 7 of radial - velocity `` jitter '' in quadrature before fitting the data for hd  80606 . 
 for all of these jitter values , the fitted parameters remained the same within their uncertainties . 
 table  1 gives the parameters derived from a fit which added 3.5  of jitter @xcite to the het data . 
 the rms about the combined fit is : coralie18.7 , het7.5 , keck5.6 . 
 @xcite noted that the eccentricity @xmath18 and the argument of periastron @xmath19 had to be held fixed in their fit to the keck data alone . 
 however , the large number of measurements included in this work allowed gaussfit to converge with all parameters free .    for hd  89744b , we combine data from the het with 6 measurements from the hjs telescope and lick data from @xcite . 
 the het data were binned in the same manner as for hd  3651 , resulting in n=33 independent visits . 
 the rms about the combined fit for each dataset is : lick17.1 , het10.7 , hjs9.5 . as with hd  3651b , 
 our derived parameters agree with those of @xcite within 2@xmath11 . 
 the scatter about our fit remains large , most likely due to the star s early spectral type ( f7v ) , which hinders precision radial - velocity measurements due to the smaller number of spectral lines . 
 for example , the f7v star hd  221287 was recently found to host a planet @xcite ; despite the superb instrumental precision of the harps spectrograph , that orbital solution has a residual rms of 8.5 . 
 the results of the dynamical simulations are shown in figures  1 - 3 . 
 the survival time of the test particles is plotted against their initial semimajor axis . 
 as shown in figure  1 , the short - period planets hd  3651 and hd  37605 sweep clean the region inside of about 0.5  au . in both of these systems , however , a small number of test particles remained in low - eccentricity orbits near the known planet s apastron distance , near the 1:2 mean - motion resonance ( mmr ) . in the hd  3651 system , particles remained stable beyond about 0.6  au , which is not surprising given the low mass of the planet . for hd  37605 , 
 two distinct strips of stability are seen in fig .  1 , corresponding to the 1:2 and 1:3 mmrs . 
 the eccentricity of the test particles in the region of the 1:2 mmr oscillated between 0.00 and 0.06 . 
 particles in 1:3 mmr oscillated in eccentricity with a larger range , up to @xmath20 , which is expected due to secular forcing . as with hd  3651 , the region beyond about 0.8  au 
 was essentially unaffected by the planet . 
 figure  2 shows the results for the hd  45350 and hd  80606 systems . 
 the long period ( 963.6 days ) and relatively large mass ( m  sin  @xmath21=1.8 ) of hd  45350b restricted stable orbits to the innermost 0.2  au . 
 these test particles oscillated in eccentricity up to @xmath22 . 
 the 4  planet orbiting hd  80606 removed all test particles to a distance of about 1.5  au , and only beyond 1.75  au did test particles remain in stable orbits for the duration of the simulation ( @xmath8 yr ) . 
 a region of instability is evident at 1.9  au due to the 8:1 mmr . 
 figure  3 shows that hd  89744b eliminated all test particles except for a narrow region near the 8:3 resonance . 
 for the 16  cyg  b system , only particles inside of about 0.3  au remained stable , leaving open the possibility of short - period planets . 
 the surviving particles oscillated in eccentricity up to @xmath23 , but these simulations treat the star as a point mass , and hence tidal damping of the eccentricity is not included 
 . our results are consistent with those of @xcite , who investigated dynamical stability in extrasolar planetary systems and found that no test particles survived in the habitable zones of the hd  80606 , hd  89744 , and 16  cyg  b systems . 
 three of these systems ( hd  3651 , hd  80606 , hd  89744 ) were monitored intensely with the het as part of a larger effort to search for low - mass , short period planets . 
 no evidence was found for any such objects in these or any of the six systems in this work . 
 we then asked what limits can be set on additional planets using the high - precision het data we have obtained . 
 the procedure for determining companion limits was identical to the method described in @xcite , except that in this work , the best - fit keplerian orbit for the known planet ( see   3.1 ) was removed before performing the limits computations . in this way 
 , we determined the radial - velocity amplitude @xmath24 for which 99% of planets would have been detected in the residuals . 
 the eccentricity of the injected test signals was chosen to be the mean eccentricity of the surviving particles from the simulations described in   3.2 . only the regions in which test particles survived were considered in these limits computations . 
 the results of these computations were highly varied , reflecting the differing observing strategies employed for these six objects . 
 in particular , hd  3651 , hd  80606 , and hd  89744 were monitored intensely with the het as part of a search for short - period objects , whereas hd  37605 and hd  45350 were only observed sporadically after the known planet orbits were defined and published @xcite , and 16  cyg  b has only been observed with the hjs telescope at a frequency of at most once per month . 
 the companion limits are shown in figures  4 - 6 ; planets with masses above the solid line can be ruled out by the data with 99% confidence . 
 not surprisingly , the tightest limits were obtained for hd  3651 ( figure  4 ) , which had a total of 195 measurements , including 29 independent het visits . 
 for periods less than about 1  year , we can exclude planets with m  sin  @xmath21  2 neptune masses . 
 similar results were obtained for 16  cyg  b ( n=161 ) , where the limits approach a neptune mass ( figure  6 ) . 
 since the detection limits generally improve with the addition of more data and with higher - quality data , we can define a quantity to measure the goodness of the limits . 
 a simple choice would be @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the total number of observations , and @xmath27 is the mean uncertainty of the radial - velocity measurements . 
 the values of @xmath26 and @xmath27 are given in table  2 .    in the hd  45350 system , the results of the dynamical simulations complement those of the detection limit determinations . 
 very tight limits are obtained in close orbits ( @xmath280.2  au ) . in this region , 
 test particles were stable ( fig .  2 ) and our observations can exclude planets with m  sin  _ i _ between about 1 and 4 neptune masses . 
 similar results were obtained for the 16  cyg  b system , in which test particles remained stable inward of @xmath29  0.3  au . in that region , 
 planets of 1 - 3 neptune masses can be excluded by our limits determinations ( fig . 
 6 ) . in most of the limits determinations 
 , there are multiple `` blind spots '' evident where the periodogram method failed to significantly recover the injected signals . 
 typically this occurs at certain trial periods for which the phase coverage of the observational data is poor , and often at the 1-month and 1-year windows .    for none of hd  37605 ( fig .  4 ) , hd  80606 ( fig .  5 ) , or hd  89744 ( fig . 
 6 ) could additional companions be ruled out below about 0.7 , and for most orbital periods tested , the limits were substantially worse . 
 one possible explanation for this result is that the sampling of the observations was poorly distributed in phase for many of the injected test signals , making significant recovery by the periodogram method difficult . 
 this is evidenced by the `` jagged '' regions in the plots . 
 also , the intrinsic scatter for those three systems was too large to permit tight limits determination . 
 this is certainly reasonable for the f7 star hd  89744 . 
 the three systems with the best limits ( hd  3651 , hd  45350 , and 16  cyg  b ) also had the lowest rms scatter about their orbital solutions ( mean=@xmath30 ; table  1 ) . 
 in contrast , the mean rms for the remaining three systems was @xmath31 . 
 additional factors such as a paucity of data ( hd  37605 ) and short time baselines ( hd  80606 , hd  89744 ) made the determination of useful companion limits challenging for some of the planetary systems in this study . 
 we have shown that for a sample of six highly eccentric extrasolar planetary systems , there is no evidence for additional planets . 
 test particle simulations show that there are regions detectable by current surveys ( i.e.  for @xmath32 au ) where additional objects can exist . for hd  3651 and hd  37605 
 , we find that protected resonances are also present . 
 combining these simulations with detection limits computed using new high - precision het data combined with all available published data is particularly effective for the hd  3651 and hd  45350 systems . 
 additional short - period planets can be ruled out down to a few neptune masses in the dynamically stable regions in these systems .

 the dynamical simulations show that short - period planets could exist in the hd  45350 and 16  cyg  b systems , and we use the observational data to set tight detection limits , which rule out additional planets down to a few neptune masses in the hd  3651 , hd  45350 , and 16  cyg  b systems .",arxiv
"supersymmetry ( susy ) is one of the most attractive extensions of the standard model . 
 this symmetry solves the naturalness problem and predicts gauge coupling unification at the gut scale @xmath1 . 
 it also predicts the existence of superpartner of the standard model ( sm ) particles . from the naturalness argument , their masses should be below tev range , hence these particles will be discovered at tevatron or large hadron collider ( lhc ) 
 .    mechanisms of susy breaking and its mediation to the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) sector are one of the most important problems in the susy phenomenology . in many models , 
 this dynamics is related to high energy physics far above the electroweak(ew ) scale , e.g. , gut scale or planck scale . 
 once the mechanism is specified , mass spectrum and flavor structure of susy particle at the ew scale can be determined by a small number of parameters . 
 hence it may be possible to confirm or exclude the mechanism by direct search or flavor - changing - neutral - current ( fcnc ) experiments in near future . 
 if susy breaking is mediated by gravity , the structure of susy breaking masses of scalars are determined by khler potential . in the present paper , 
 we focus on the no - scale type khler potential , in which the hidden sector and the observable sector are separated as follows : @xmath2 where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are hidden sector fields and observable sector fields , respectively 
 . this type of khler potential is originally investigated in ref . 
 @xcite with @xmath5 and @xmath6 . 
 characteristic features of the khler potential eq.([eq : noscalekahler ] ) is that all scalar masses and trilinear scalar couplings ( a - terms ) vanish as the cosmological constant vanishes@xcite . 
 the only source of susy breaking is gaugino masses . 
 hence this scenario is highly predictive , various phenomenological consequences are obtained with a few parameters . the separation in eq.([eq : noscalekahler ] ) implies that couplings of the hidden sector and the observable sector is flavor blind , and contributions of susy particles to fcnc are suppressed . 
 therefore this khler potential is also interesting from the viewpoint of the susy flavor problem . 
 the no - scale structure of the khler potential is obtained in various models . 
 it has been shown that in some classes of string theory , for example weakly coupled @xmath7 heterotic string theory , khler potential becomes the no - scale type@xcite . if the hidden sector and the observable sector are separated in the superspace density in the supergravity lagrangian , the khler potential is indeed given as in eq . 
 ( [ eq : noscalekahler ] ) . in the two cases , 
 the gaugino masses can be induced if the hidden sector fields couple to the gauge multiplets via the gauge kinetic function . 
 recently it has been pointed out that the form eq.([eq : noscalekahler ] ) is realized naturally in a five - dimensional setting with two branes , namely , sequestered sector scenario@xcite . in this scenario , 
 the hidden sector fields live on one brane and the visible sector fields live on the other . 
 it has been shown that the form of the khler potential of the effective theory obtained by dimensional reduction is indeed eq.([eq : noscalekahler])@xcite . 
 if the sm gauge fields dwell in the bulk , gaugino mediate the susy breaking on the hidden sector brane to the visible sector brane and the no - scale boundary condition is given at the compactification scale of the fifth dimension ( gaugino mediation @xcite ) .    in the no - scale scenario , degrees of freedom of susy particle mass spectrum 
 is limited because only non - zero soft susy breaking masses are gaugino masses and higgs mixing mass @xmath8 at the energy scale where the boundary condition is given . hence phenomenological aspects of this scenario have been investigated in the literature , mainly focusing on the mass spectrum . 
 direct search bounds and the cosmological constraint ( i.e. , a charged particle can not be the lsp if the r - parity is conserved ) were considered and allowed region in the parameter space was identified . for the boundary condition , 
 the following three cases were considered . 
 first , universal gaugino masses are given at the gut scale . 
 in this case , the cosmological constraint is severe and only the region @xmath9 and @xmath10 is allowed since stau tends to be light@xcite . 
 the second case is that universal gaugino masses are given above the gut scale . 
 and the third case is that non - universal gaugino masses are given at the gut scale . in this case wino , 
 higgsino or sneutrino can be the lsp . in the latter two cases , 
 it is shown that the cosmological constraint is not severer than the first case .    in the present paper , 
 current limits from the lightest higgs mass @xmath11 and the branching ratio for @xmath0 are also used to constrain the no - scale scenario . combining these constraints 
 , we will show that almost all the parameter region is excluded when universal gaugino masses are given at the gut scale . 
 however , when the boundary condition is given above the gut scale , relatively large parameter region is allowed . 
 we also consider the case that the non - universal gaugino masses are given at the gut scale . 
 we will show that these constraints are important when the higgsino - like neutralino is the lsp . 
 this paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : noscalsebc ] , we review some phenomenological aspects of the no - scale models , especially indications of the direct search bounds and the cosmological bound . in section [ sec : higgsbsgamma ] , we further constrain these models from the higgs mass bound and @xmath12 result . indications of these bounds for the tevatron are also discussed . 
 our conclusions are given in section [ sec : conclusions ] . 
 in this section , we briefly review phenomenological aspects of susy models with no - scale boundary condition , mainly indications of the cosmological bound and direct search limit at lep 2 . 
 we consider the following three cases .    * 
 universal gaugino masses are given at the gut scale . 
 hereafter we call this case the minimal scenario . * 
 universal gaugino masses are given above the gut scale @xmath13 . throughout this paper 
 , we take the minimal su(5 ) to be the theory above the gut scale as a typical example . * 
 non - universal gaugino masses are given at the gut scale . 
 once one of the above boundary conditions is given , mass spectrum of susy particles at the ew scale and their contributions to fcnc can be calculated . in this paper 
 we solve the one - loop level rges to obtain the soft susy breaking mass parameters at the ew scale . 
 the higgsino mass parameter @xmath14 is determined by potential minimum condition at the one - loop level . 
 first , we discuss the minimal scenario . in this case 
 , the following boundary condition is given at the gut scale , @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the common scalar mass and @xmath17 is universal trilinear scalar coupling . with this boundary condition , bino and right - handed 
 sleptons are lighter than other susy particles . 
 their masses are approximately , @xmath18 from eq.([eq : minimalmneumtau ] ) we see that the charged right - handed slepton is the lsp if the d - term @xmath19 is negligible , i.e. , @xmath20 . 
 hence this parameter region is excluded by the cosmological consideration . on the other hand , 
 lep 2 experiments yields the upper bound on the cross section for smuon pair production , @xmath21 for @xmath22 and @xmath23@xcite , so the parameter region @xmath24 is excluded in fig . 
 [ fig : limitmimposmu ] and [ fig : limitmimnegmu ] , allowed region of the parameter space are shown in the @xmath25 plane . 
 the regions above the dash - dotted line and the left side of the dash - dot - dotted line are excluded by cosmological bound and lep 2 bound on smuon pair production , respectively . 
 therefore the minimal scenario is constrained severely . 
 next we see the case that the universal gaugino masses are given above the gut scale . in the minimal su(5 ) case , the right - handed slepton belongs to 10-plet , so the large group factor makes slepton masses heavier . 
 for example , when @xmath26 the bino mass and the right - handed slepton mass at the weak scale are approximately given , @xmath27 hence the cosmological constraint is not severe because the stau mass is large enough and neutralino is the lsp in the large parameter region @xcite . in the fig.[fig : limitmbc1e17posmu ] and [ fig : limitmbc1e17negmu ] , the same figures as in the fig.[fig : limitmimposmu ] and [ fig : limitmimnegmu ] are shown . 
 unlike in the minimal case , the stau search bound at lep @xcite is also plotted because mass difference between @xmath28 and @xmath29 is larger than in the minimal case and it can be stronger than the smuon search . from these figures we see that the @xmath29 lsp is avoided unless @xmath30 is larger than about 20 . 
 the charged stau lsp can also be avoided if gaugino masses at the gut scale are non - universal@xcite , i.e. , the following boundary condition is given , @xmath31 this boundary condition can be given naturally within the gut framework @xcite . in this case , 
 not only bino - like neutralino , but also wino - like , higgsino - like neutralino or sneutrino can be the lsp . for @xmath32 and @xmath33 , 
 the lsp is wino - like neutralino . 
 for example , when @xmath34 and @xmath35 , then wino mass and charged slepton mass are ( notice that in this case the left - handed sleptons are lighter than right - handed sleptons ) ; @xmath36 the higgsino is the lsp if @xmath37 . for example , when @xmath38 and @xmath39 , then the higgsino mass and the right - handed slepton mass are @xmath40 in the two cases given above , neutral wino or higgsino is the lsp . 
 in fact from fig.[fig : limit12r432r2posmu ] - [ fig : limit12r232r0.5negmu ] we find that neural particle is the lsp in large parameter region , thus it is cosmologically viable . 
 in the previous section we take into account only lep 2 bound and the cosmological constraint . 
 we find that the minimal scenario is severely constrained , but the other two scenarios are not . in this section 
 we also include the current higgs mass bound and @xmath41 constraint . 
 as we will see , combining the above four constraint , not only the minimal case but also the other two scenarios can be constrained more severely . 
 we also discuss the possibility whether this scenario can be seen at the tevatron run 2 or not . 
 before we show the numerical results , some remarks on our calculation of the higgs mass and @xmath12 are in order . 
 it is well known that radiative correction is important when the lightest higgs mass is evaluated @xcite . in the present paper , 
 the lightest higgs mass is evaluated by means of the one - loop level effective potential@xcite . 
 this potential is evaluated at the renormalization point of the geometrical mean of the two stop mass eigenvalues @xmath42 . 
 we compared our result with a two - loop result by using _ 
 feynhiggs_@xcite , and checked that the difference between these two results is smaller than 5 gev as long as @xmath30 is bigger than 5 . 
 when @xmath30 is close to 2 , the difference can be 7 gev . 
 however , as we will see later , higgs mass bound plays an important rule around @xmath43 . and 
 the two - loop effects always make the higgs mass lighter than that obtained at the one - loop level . 
 so our conclusion is conservative and is not significantly changed by the two - loop effect . 
 we exclude the parameter region where the lightest higgs mass is lighter than the current 95% c.l . 
 limit from lep 2 experiments , @xmath44 @xcite .    in the present paper , @xmath12 
 is calculated including leading order ( lo ) qcd corrections@xcite , and compare it to the current cleo measurement . in the mssm 
 , chargino contribution can be comparable to the sm and charged higgs contributions . 
 they interfere constructively ( destructively ) each other when @xmath45 ( @xmath46 ) . 
 the difference between the lo and the next - to - leading order ( nlo ) result can be sizable only when cancellation among different contributions at the lo is spoiled by the nlo contributions . 
 as we will see , however , the @xmath41 constraint is severe when the interference is constructive . in the case of destructive interference where the deviation from the nlo result may be large , 
 this constraint is not so important . 
 hence we expect that our conclusion is not changed significantly by the inclusion of the nlo corrections . for the experimental value 
 , we use 95% c.l . 
 limit from cleo , @xmath47 @xcite . 
 first we show the numerical results for the minimal case . 
 the case for @xmath48 is shown in fig.[fig : limitmimposmu ] . in this case , for small @xmath30 region , the stop mass is not so large that radiative correction factor @xmath49 which raises the higgs mass is small . 
 ( for example , @xmath50 gev and @xmath51 gev for @xmath52 gev and @xmath53 ) . 
 hence the higgs mass limit constrains this scenario severely . in fig.[fig : limitmimposmu ] , the higgs mass bound and @xmath12 constraints in the @xmath54 plane are shown . 
 the regions below the solid line and above the dashed line are excluded by the higgs mass and @xmath12 bound , respectively . 
 the indication of @xmath55 reported by lep 2@xcite is also shown in this figure . from the figure we find that the higgs mass bound almost excludes the region where the stau lsp is avoided . 
 note that , as we discussed earlier , the bound we put on the higgs mass may be conservative , because the two loop correction may further reduce the higgs mass .    the same figure but for @xmath56 is shown in fig.[fig : limitmimnegmu ] . 
 now @xmath12 also constrains parameter region strongly since chargino contribution to @xmath0 interferes with sm and charged higgs ones constructively . 
 the region above the dashed line is excluded by @xmath12 constraint . 
 we find that only one of the two constraints is enough to exclude all the region where cosmological bound and the smuon mass bound are avoided . 
 hence if r - parity is conserved , i.e. , the cosmological bound is relevant , this scenario with @xmath56 is excluded . 
 next we show the numerical results in the case that the cutoff scale is larger than the gut scale . as a typical example , we choose the minimal su(5 ) as the theory above the gut scale . in fig.[fig : 
 limitmbc1e17posmu ] and [ fig : limitmbc1e17negmu ] , results are shown for positive and negative @xmath14 , respectively . in both figures , 
 we take @xmath58 gev . for @xmath48 case , large parameter region 
 is allowed and susy scale @xmath59 can be as small as about 180 gev , which indicates the lsp mass @xmath60 gev . for @xmath56 , as in the minimal case , @xmath12 constraint is severer , and @xmath59 must be larger than around 280 gev . 
 we also considered other values of the boundary scale @xmath61 from @xmath62 to @xmath63 , and checked that the behavior of the contour plot does not change so much . 
 according to ref.@xcite , tevatron run 2 experiment can explore up to @xmath64 gev for integrated luminosity @xmath65 . 
 hence if @xmath66 and @xmath67 , susy particles can be discovered at the experiment . in this range , 
 trilepton from chargino - neutralino associated production @xmath68 , @xmath69 , @xmath70 is one of clean signals for susy search . 
 notice that now two body decay @xmath71 opens . 
 so same flavor , opposite sign dilepton from @xmath72 decay may be useful . 
 the two body decay allows us to observe the peak edge of invariant mass of two leptons at the @xmath73 . 
 it is expressed in terms of the neutralino masses and the slepton mass as , @xmath74 in table [ tab : mllmax ] , the dependence of @xmath73 on @xmath61 is shown . here 
 we fix @xmath75 . 
 notice that as @xmath61 changes , the right - handed mass changes sizably while the neutralino masses do not . 
 hence we can obtain the mass relation among them and also cutoff scale @xmath61 , which corresponds to the compactification scale in the sequestered sector scenario , by measuring @xmath73 . on the other hand , since only @xmath76 gev is allowed for @xmath45 , the tevatron run 2 can not survey this scenario , and we have to wait lhc experiment . 
 next , we turn to the case that gaugino masses are non - universal at the gut scale . 
 we explore the following three cases , wino - like neutralino lsp , higgsino - like neutralino lsp and the tau sneutrino lsp . 
 we will see that in the wino - like neutralino lsp and tau sneutrino lsp cases , constraint is not so severe even if we combine higgs mass bound and @xmath12 data , but in the higgsino - like lsp case where stops are as light as sleptons and charginos , the predicted higgs mass tends to be small , and thus the higgs mass bound becomes important . 
 first , we discuss the wino - lsp case . 
 the results for @xmath34 , @xmath35 are shown in fig.[fig : limit12r432r2posmu ] and fig.[fig : limit12r432r2negmu ] , for @xmath46 and @xmath45 , respectively . in this case , we obtain a relatively large higgs mass since @xmath77 is large and so are the masses of stops . 
 hence , for @xmath46 , @xmath78 can be as small as 100 gev at @xmath43 , where the mass of the lsp @xmath79 is about 90 gev . for @xmath45 
 , though @xmath12 constraint is slightly severer than in the @xmath46 case , @xmath80 is allowed , which corresponds to @xmath81 . 
 hence the wino - lsp with mass around 100 gev is allowed . 
 examples of the mass spectrum in this case are listed as point a ( @xmath46 ) and point b ( @xmath45 ) in table [ tab : spectrum ] . at the both points , 
 @xmath59 is chosen to be near the smallest value such that all constraints are avoided . 
 in general , however , masses of @xmath28 and @xmath82 are highly degenerate when wino is the lsp . 
 in fact , from table [ tab : spectrum ] , we see that the mass difference is less than 1 gev . 
 therefore a lepton from @xmath70 is very soft and trilepton signal search is not useful because acceptance cut usually requires the smallest transverse momentum of the three leptons @xmath83 to be larger than 5 gev@xcite . 
 recently collider phenomenology in such cases are studied in ref . 
 it is shown that certain range of @xmath84 and @xmath85 , susy signals which are different from those in the minimal case can be detected . 
 the high degeneracy requires to include radiative corrections to calculate @xmath85 @xcite , which is beyond of this work . 
 it deserves detail study to estimate the mass difference in the scenario . 
 since the constraint for the sneutrino lsp case in the @xmath86 plane is similar to those in the wino - lsp case , we show the result for @xmath46 only in fig.[fig : limit12r2.532r1.5posmu ] . in the figure 
 , we take @xmath87 and @xmath88 . 
 notice that the decomposition of the lsp depends on @xmath30 and the sneutrino is the lsp for @xmath89 . 
 an example of the mass spectrum is listed as the point c in table [ tab : spectrum ] . in this case , 
 trilepton signal comes from @xmath90 , @xmath91 , @xmath92 . 
 since @xmath93 , @xmath94 of a lepton from @xmath82 decay is small and this signal may be hard to be detected . 
 we may need unusual trigger to explore this scenario . 
 next , we turn to the higgsino lsp case . 
 higgsino lsp scenario is realized when @xmath77 is smaller than half of @xmath78 , which indicates that colored particles are lighter than in the universal gaugino mass case . 
 hence the one - loop correction to the higgs potential which enhances the higgs mass is small and the higgs mass constraint is important . the same figures as fig.[fig : limitmimposmu ] and [ fig : limitmimnegmu ] are shown in fig.[fig : limit12r232r0.5posmu ] ( @xmath46 ) and fig.[fig : limit12r232r0.5negmu ] ( @xmath45 ) for @xmath95 and @xmath39 . in order to satisfy the higgs mass bound , @xmath78 must be larger than around 300 gev . 
 combining the bound with @xmath12 , constraint becomes severer , especially for @xmath45 case where @xmath96 is required . 
 example of mass spectrum in this scenario is listed as point d and e in table [ tab : spectrum ] . 
 again we choose almost the smallest value of @xmath78 where all constraints are avoided . 
 we see that the lsp mass must be at least @xmath97 for @xmath46 and @xmath98 for @xmath45 . 
 hence this scenario can not be explored at the tevatron run 2 . 
 the no - scale type boundary conditions are obtained in various types of susy models . 
 this scenario is attractive because it is highly predictive and can be a solution to the susy flavor problem . in this paper 
 we investigated the indication of the current higgs mass and @xmath41 constraint on susy models with the boundary condition . 
 first we considered the minimal case where the universal gaugino mass are given at the gut scale . 
 this scenario has been already constrained by direct search at lep and the cosmological bound severely , under the assumption of the exact r - parity . 
 we showed that the higgs mass bound and @xmath41 constraint are also taken into account , then almost all the parameter region is excluded , leaving very narrow allowed region for @xmath48 . 
 next we considered the case that the boundary condition is given above the gut scale . 
 since the cosmological constraint is not severe , wide region of the parameter space is allowed . in the @xmath46 case , 
 tevatron have a chance to observe susy signatures like trilepton events . 
 the scale @xmath61 may be explored by measuring the peak edge of invariant mass of two leptons at the @xmath73 . 
 however for the @xmath45 case , since @xmath99 is required , we have to wait lhc . 
 finally we considered the case where non - universal gaugino masses are given at the gut scale . 
 we see that the higgs mass bound is strong in the higgsino lsp case because stop masses are as light as sleptons and charginos . 
 the mass of the higgsino - like neutralino must be larger than about 245 gev and 370 gev for @xmath46 and @xmath45 , respectively . in the wino lsp and sneutrino lsp case 
 , the mass of the lsp can be as small as 150 gev . 
 however , the mass difference between the lsp and parent particles produced at the collider is much smaller than in the minimal case , unusual acceptance cut may be required .

"it has been known for a long time that owing to planar property and mutual focussing , colliding plane waves ( cpw ) result in spacelike singularities [ 1 ] . 
 these singularities are somewhat weakened when the waves are endowed with a relative cross polarization prior to the collision . a solution given by chandrasekhar and xanthopoulos ( cx ) 
 [ 2 ] , however constitutes an example contrasting this category , namely , it possesses a cauchy horizon ( ch ) instead of a spacelike singularity . 
 naturally , this solution initiated a literature devoted entirely on the quest of stability of horizons formed hitherto . 
 ch formed in spacetimes of cpw was shown by yurtsever to be unstable against plane - symmetric perturbations [ 3 ] 
 . a linear perturbation analysis by cx reveals also an analogues result [ 4 ] . 
 any such perturbation applied to a cpw spacetime will turn the ch into an essential singularity . 
 a second factor that proved effective in weakening the strength of a singularity in cpw is the electromagnetic ( em ) field itself . in other words , the degree of divergence in 
 the curvature scalars of colliding pure gravitational waves turn out to be stronger than the case when em field is coupled to gravity . 
 in particular , collision of pure em waves must have a special significance as far as singularity formation is concerned . 
 such an interesting solution was given by bell and szekeres ( bs ) which describes the collision of two linearly polarized step em waves [ 5 ] . 
 the singularity ( in fact a ch ) formed in the interaction region of the bs solution was shown to be removable by a coordinate transformation . 
 on the null boundaries , however it possesses esential curvature singularities which can not be removed by any means . 
 since cross polarization and em field both play roles in the nature of resulting singularity it is worthwhile to purse these features together . 
 this invokes a cross polarized version of the bs ( cpbs ) solution which was found long time ago [ 6,7 ] . 
 this metric had the nice feature that the weyl scalars are all regular in the interaction region . 
 cross polarization , however , does not remove the singularities formed on the null boundaries . in this paper 
 we choose cpbs solution as a test ground , instead of bs , with various added test fields to justify the validity of a ch stability conjecture proposed previously by helliwell and konkowski ( hk ) [ 8,9 ] . unlike the tedious perturbation analysis of both cx and yurtsever the conjecture seems to be much economical in reaching a direct conclusion about the stability of a ch . 
 this is our main motivation for considering the problem anew , for the case of untested solutions in cpw . in this paper 
 we look at the spacetimes : a ) single plane wave with added colliding test fields and b ) colliding plane waves having non - singular interaction regions with test field added , fig.1 illustrates these cases 
 .    the terminology of singularities should be follwed from the classification presented by ellis and schmidt [ 10 ] . 
 singularities in maximal four dimensional spacetimes can be divided into three basic types : quasiregular ( qr ) , scalar curvature ( sc ) and non - scalar curvature ( nsc ) . the ch stability conjecture due to hk is defined as follows .    for all maximally extended spacetimes with ch 
 , the backreaction due to a field ( whose test stress - energy tensor is @xmath0 ) will affect the horizon in one of the following manners . 
 @xmath1 , @xmath2 and any null dust density @xmath3 are finite , and if the stress energy tensor @xmath4 in all parallel propagated orthonormal ( ppon ) frames is finite , then the ch remains non - singular . 
 b)if @xmath1 , @xmath2 and any null dust density @xmath3 are finite , but @xmath4 diverges in some ppon frames , then an nsc singularity will be formed at the ch . 
 c)if @xmath1 , @xmath2 and any null dust density @xmath3 diverges , then an sc singularity will be formed at the ch 
 .    expressed otherwise , the conjecture suggests to put a test field into the background geometry and study the reaction it will experience . if certain scalars diverge then in an exact back - reaction solution the field will respond with an infinite strength to the geometry ( i.e action versus reaction ) . 
 such an infinite back - reaction will render a ch unstable and convert it into a scalar singularity . + the paper is organized as follows . in section 
 ii , we review the cpbs solution and the correct nature of the singularity structure is presented in appendix a. section iii , deals with geodesics and test em and scalar field analyses . in section iv , we present an exact back reaction calculation for the collision of cross polarized em field coupled with scalar field . 
 the derivation of weyl and maxwell scalars are given in appendix b. the insertion of test null dusts to the background cpbs spacetime and its exact back reaction solution is studied in section v. appendix c is devoted for the properties of this solution . 
 the paper is concluded with a discussion in section vi . 
 the metric that describes collision of em waves with the cross polarization was found to be [ 7 ] + @xmath5    in this representation of the metric our notations are + @xmath6 in which @xmath7 is a constant measuring the second polarization , @xmath8 are constant of energy and @xmath9 stand for the usual null coordinates . 
 it can be seen easily that for @xmath10 the metric reduces to bs . unlike the bs metric , however , this is conformally non - flat for @xmath11 , where the conformal curvature is generated by the cross polarization . as a matter of fact 
 this solution is a minimal extension of the bs metric . 
 a completely different generalization of the bs solution with second polarization was given by cx [ 11 ] . 
 their solution , however , employs an ehlers transformation and involves two essential parameters which is therefore different from ours . both solutions 
 form ch in the interaction region . 
 our result drown out in this paper , namely , that the horizon is unstable against added sources can also be shown to apply to the cx metric as well . as it was shown before the interaction region @xmath12 of the above 
 metric is of type - d without scalar curvature singularities . 
 we wish to check now the possible singularities of metric ( 1 ) . 
 the single component of the weyl scalar suffices to serve our purpose . 
 we find that the real part of the weyl scalar @xmath13 is given by @xmath14\end{aligned}\ ] ] where we have used the abbreviations @xmath15 as @xmath16 we obtain @xmath17 which reduces to the singularity form of the bs spacetime given by @xmath18 . 
 we see that the same singularity remains unaffected by the introduction of the cross polarization . a similar calculation for @xmath19 
 gives the symmetrical singular hypersurface sitting on @xmath20 . 
 now in order to explore the true nature of the singularity we concentrate our account on the incoming region ii @xmath21 . 
 the metric in this region is expressed in the form @xmath22\ ] ] where @xmath23 we observe that for @xmath24 , @xmath25 is a bounded positive definite function which suggests that no additional singularities arise except the one occuring already in the bs case , namely at @xmath26 . to justify this 
 we have calculated all riemann components in local and ppon frames ( see appendix a ) . it is found that all riemann tensor components vanish as @xmath27 . in the ppon frame , however , they are all finite and according to the classification scheme of ellis and schmidt such a singularity is called a quasiregular ( qr ) singularity . this is said to be the mildest type among all types of singularities . to check whether the qr is stable or not we consider generic test fields added to such a background geometry and study the effects . 
 this we will do in the follwing sections . 
 we are interested in the stability of qr singularities that are developed at @xmath28 in region ii and @xmath29 in region iii . to investigate their stability we will express geodesics and behaviour of test em and scalar fields by calculating stress - energy tensor in local and ppon frames . + 
 our discussion on geodesics will be restricted in region ii only . 
 we shall consider the geodesics that originate at the wave front and move toward the quasiregular singularity . 
 solution of geodesics equations in region ii can be obtained by geodesics lagrangian method and using @xmath30 as a parameter . 
 the results are @xmath31}{a}\tan(au ) +   \frac{3p_{x_{0}}\left[5q^{2}+2 - 2\sqrt{1+q^{2}}\right]u}{4 } \nonumber \\ & & - \frac{p_{x_{0}}\left[\sqrt{1+q^{2}}-1\right]^{2}}{8a } \sin(2au ) -   \frac{2p_{y_{0}}q}{a\cos(au ) } \nonumber \\ y - y_{0}&=&-\frac{2qp_{x_{0}}}{a\cos(au)}-\frac{2p_{y_{0}}\tan(au)}{a }   \nonumber \\ v - v_{0}&=&\frac{\tan(au)}{a}\left[p^{2}_{x_0}(1 + 2q^2 ) + p^{2}_{y_{0}}\right ]   + u\left[\frac{\epsilon}{4}(1 + 3\sqrt{1+q^{2}})\right . \nonumber \\ & & \left.-\frac{3p^2_{x_0}}{8}(5q^{2}+2 - 2\sqrt{1+q^{2}})\right ] +   \frac{2p_{x_{0}}p_{y_{0}}q}{a\cos(au ) }    \nonumber \\ & & + \frac { ( \sqrt{1+q^{2}}-1 ) \sin(2au)}{8a}\left[\frac{p^{2}_{x_{0}}}{2 } (   \sqrt{1+q^{2}}-1)-\epsilon\right]\end{aligned}\ ] ] where @xmath32 for null and @xmath33 for time like geodesics and @xmath34 and @xmath35 are constants of integration . 
 it can be checked easily that for @xmath10 our geodesics agree with those of the region ii of the bs metric [ 8 ] . 
 it is clear to see that if either @xmath36 or @xmath35 is nonzero then @xmath37 becomes positive for @xmath38 , and particles can pass from region ii to the region iv . 
 geodesics that remain in region ii are @xmath39 where @xmath40 . 
 the effect of cross polarization is that more geodesics remains in region ii relative to the parallel polarization case . on physical grounds 
 this result could be anticipated because cross polarization behaves like rotation which creates a pushing out effect in the non - inertial frames .      to test the stability of quasiregular singularity , 
 let us consider a test em field whose vector potential is choosen appropriately as in [ 9 ] to be @xmath41 with arbitrary functions @xmath42 and @xmath43 . 
 the only nonzero energy - momentum for this test em field is @xmath44\ ] ] in which a prime denotes derivative with respect to @xmath37 . 
 both of scalars @xmath45 and @xmath2 vanish , predicting that qr singularities are not transformed into a scs . in the ppon frame . 
 @xmath46 we find that @xmath47 are given in terms of @xmath48 by @xmath49 for@xmath50 and @xmath51 , otherwise . 
 the divergence of this quantity predicts the occurence of nscs and therefore qr singularity must be unstable . 
 + the stability conjecture therefore correctly finds that these qr singularities are unstable . 
 however , the same stability conjecture does not find correctly the nature of the singularity . as we have discussed in section ii 
 , the interior of the interaction region has no scs . 
 the only scs is on the null boundaries . 
 clarke and hayward have analysed these singular points for a collinear bs spacetime and found that the singularity nature of surfaces @xmath52 and @xmath53 are qr . this observation can also be used in the cross polarized version of bs spacetime , because the order of diverging terms in @xmath54 and @xmath13 are the same . 
 the qr singularity structure formed in the incoming region of bs problem remains unchanged in the case of cross polarized version of the same problem . 
 let us now consider the stability of these qr singularities by imposing a test scalar field in region ii which is the one of the incoming region bounded by the qr singularity . 
 the massless scalar field equation is given by @xmath55 where we consider @xmath56 independent scalar waves so that a particular solution to this equation is obtained as in the ref ( ) @xmath57 where @xmath58 and @xmath59 are arbitrary functions . 
 the stress energy tensor is given by @xmath60 the corresponding non - zero stress - energy tensors for the test scalar wave is obtained by taking @xmath61 as , @xmath62f(v)f'(v ) } {   8\pi f^{2 } } \nonumber \\ 
 t_{xy}&=&t_{yx}=\frac{aq\sin(au ) \tan(au ) f(v)f'(v)}{8 \pi f^{2}}\end{aligned}\ ] ] it is observed that each component diverges as the qr singularity @xmath63 is approached . 
 + next we consider the stress energy tensor in a ppon frame . 
 such frame vectors are given in equation ( 11 ) . 
 the stress - energy tensor is @xmath64 the nonzero components are ; @xmath65 \nonumber   \\ 
 t_{01}&=&t_{10}=\left(\frac{\sec^{2}(au)}{16 \pi}\right)\left[\frac{a^{2 }   \tan^{2}(au)f^2}{f^{2}}-f'^{2}(v)\right ] \nonumber   \\ 
 t_{22}&=&t_{33}=\left(\frac{a\sec^{2}(au)\tan(au)f(v)f'(v)}{8\pi   f^{3}}\right)\left[f^{2 } + 2q^{2}\sin^{2}(au)\right ] \nonumber \\ t_{32}&=&t_{23}=\frac{aq\sec^{3}(au)\sin^{2}(au)f'(v)f(v)\sqrt{f^{2 }   + q^{2}\sin^{2}(au)}}{4\pi f^{3}}\end{aligned}\ ] ] these components also diverge as the singularity @xmath66 is approached .    by the conjecture 
 , this indicates that the qr singularity will be transformed into a curvature singularity . 
 finally we calculate the scalar @xmath67 . 
 @xmath68 \right\}\end{aligned}\ ] ] which also diverges as @xmath69 . from these analyses 
 we conclude that the curvature singularity formed will be an scs . 
 + hence , the conjecture predicts that the qr singularities of cross polarized version of bs spacetime are unstable . 
 it is predicted that the qr singularities will be converted to scalar curvature singularities if generic waves are added . 
 the similar results have also been obtained by hk for the bs spacetime . 
 hk was unable to compare the validity of the conjecture by an exact back - reaction solution . 
 in the next section we present an explicit example that represents cross - polarized em field coupled with scalar field . 
 in the former sections , we applied hk stability conjecture to test the stability of qr singularities in the incoming region of cpbs spacetime . according to the conjecture 
 these mild singularities are unstable . in order to see the validity of the conjecture we introduce this new solution . 
 + let the metric be ; @xmath70\ ] ] the new solution is obtained from the electrovacuum solution . 
 the ems solution is generated in the following manner . 
 the lagrangian density of the system is defined by @xmath71\end{aligned}\ ] ] which correctly generate all ems field equations from a variational principle . here 
 @xmath72 is the scalar field and we define the em potential one - form ( with coupling constant @xmath73 ) by @xmath74 where @xmath75 and @xmath76 are the components in the killing directions . variation with respect to @xmath77 and @xmath72 yields the following ems equations . 
 @xmath78   \\ 2b_{uv}&=&-v_{v}b_{u}-v_{u}b_{v}-tanhw\left(w_{v}b_{u}+w_{u}b_{v}\right ) \nonumber \\ & & -e^{v}\left[2b_{uv}tanhw + w_{u}b_{v}+w_{v}b_{u}\right]\end{aligned}\ ] ] where @xmath79 and @xmath80 are the newmann - penrose spinors for em plane waves given as follows @xmath81 \nonumber \\ \phi_{0}&= & \frac{e^{u/2}}{\sqrt{2}}\left[e^{-v/2}\left(isinh\frac{w}{2 }   + cosh\frac{w}{2}\right)a_{v}\right . \nonumber \\ & & \left.+e^{v/2}\left(icosh\frac{w}{2}+sinh\frac{w}{2}\right)b_{v}\right ] \end{aligned}\ ] ] the remaining two equations which do not follow from the variations , namely @xmath82 are automatically satisfied by virtue of integrability equations . 
 + the metric function @xmath83 can be shifted now in accordance with + @xmath84 where @xmath85 and @xmath86 satisfy the electrovacuum em equations . 
 integrability condition for the equation ( 31 ) imposes the constraint , @xmath87=0\ ] ] from which we can generate a large class of ems solution . as an example , for any @xmath88 satisfying the massless scalar field equation the corresponding @xmath89 is obtained from @xmath90 the only effect of coupling a scalar field to the cross polarized em wave is to alter the metric into the form , @xmath91 here @xmath92 and @xmath93 represents the solution of electrovacuum equations and @xmath89 is the function that derives from the presence of the scalar field . 
 + it can be easily seen that for @xmath10 our solution represents pure em bs solution coupled with scalar field . 
 it constitutes therefore an exact back reaction solution to the test scalar field solution in the bs spacetime considered by hk ( ) . 
 it is clear to see that the weyl scalars are nonzero and scs is forming on the surface @xmath94 . 
 this is in aggrement with the requirement of stability conjecture introduced by hk . for @xmath24 the obtained solution forms the exact back reaction solution of the test scalar field solution in the cpbs spacetime . in appendix b , we present the weyl and maxwell scalars explicitly . 
 + from the explicit solutions we note that , the coulomb component @xmath95 remains regular but @xmath13 and @xmath54 are singular when @xmath96 or @xmath97 . 
 this indicates that the singularity structure of the new solution is a typical scs . 
 this result is in complete agreement with the stability conjecture . 
 * a ) * let us assume first null test dusts moving in the cpbs background . for simplicity 
 we consider two different cases the @xmath98 and @xmath99 projections of the spacetime . 
 we have in the first case @xmath100 where we have used the coordinates @xmath101 according to @xmath102 the energy - momentum tensor for two oppositely moving null dusts can be chosen as @xmath103 where @xmath104 and @xmath105 are the finite energy densities of the dusts . 
 the null propagation directions @xmath106 and @xmath107 are @xmath108 with @xmath109 @xmath110 we observe from ( 1 ) that @xmath111 which is finite for @xmath112 . 
 the components of energy - momentum tensors in ppon frames are proportional to the expression ( 38 ) . 
 this proportionality makes all the components of energy - momentum tensors finite . in the limit as @xmath113 which reduces our line element to the bs 
 this expression diverges on the horizon @xmath114 . 
 trace of the energy - momentum is obviously zero therefore we must extract information from the scalar @xmath115 . 
 one obtains , @xmath116 the projection on @xmath99 , however is not as promising as the @xmath98 case . 
 consider the reduced metric @xmath117 a similar analysis with the null vectors @xmath118 with @xmath119 @xmath120 yields the scalar @xmath121 from the metric ( 1 ) we see that @xmath122 which diverges on the horizon @xmath123 . 
 the scalar @xmath124 constructed from the test dusts therefore diverges . 
 the ppon components of the energy momentum tensors are also calculated and it is found that all of the components are proportional to the expression ( 42 ) . 
 this indicates that the components of energy - momentum tensor diverges as the singularity is approached . 
 when we consider the hk stability conjecture an exact back reaction solution must give a singular solution . 
 we present now an exact back reaction solution of two colliding null shells in the interaction region of the cpbs spacetime . + * b ) * the metric given by @xmath125 where @xmath126 with @xmath127 positive constants was considered by wang [ 12 ] to represent collision of two null shells ( or impulsive dusts ) . 
 the interaction region is transformable to the de sitter cosmological spacetime . in other words 
 the tail of two crossing null shells is energetically equivalent to the de sitter space . 
 it can be shown also that the choice of the conformal factor @xmath128 , with @xmath129 positive constants becomes isomorphic to the anti - de sitter space . 
 + the combined metric of cpbs and colliding shells can be represented by @xmath130 this amounts to the substitutions @xmath131 where @xmath132 correspond to the metric functions of the cpbs solution . under this substitutions 
 the scale invariant weyl scalars remain invariant ( or at most multiplied by a conformal factor ) because @xmath133 is the combination that arise in those scalars . the scalar curvature , however , which was zero in the case of cpbs now arises as nonzero and becomes divergent as we approach the horizon . 
 appendix c gives the scalar quantities @xmath134 and @xmath135 . 
 thus the exact back reaction solution is a singular one as predicted by the conjecture . 
 it is further seen that choosing @xmath136 , which removes one of the shells leaves us with a single shell propagating in the @xmath37- direction . from the scalars we see that even a single shell gives rise to a divergent back reaction by the spacetime . 
 the horizon , in effect , is unstable and transforms into a singularity in the presence of two colliding , or even a single propagating null shell . 
 let us note as an alternative interpretation that the metric ( 43 ) may be considered as a colliding em waves in a de sitter background . 
 collision of em waves creates an unstable horizon in the de sitter space which is otherwise regular for @xmath137 and @xmath138 . 
 in this paper we have analysed the stability of qr singularities in the cpbs spacetime . 
 three types of test fields are used to probe the stability . 
 first we have applied test em field to the background cpbs spacetime . from the analyses we observed that the qr singularity in the incoming region becomes unstable according to the conjecture , and 
 it is transformed into nsc singularity . 
 this is the prediction of the conjecture . 
 however , the exact back - reaction solution shoes that beside the true singularities on the null boundaries @xmath139 and @xmath140 
 . there are quasiregular singularities in the incoming regions . 
 the interior of interaction region is singularity free and the hypersurface @xmath141 is a killing - cauchy horizon . 
 as it was pointed out by hk in the case of colliding em step waves , conjecture fails to predict the correct nature of the singularity in the interaction region . 
 we have also discovered the same behaviour for the cross polarized version of colliding em step waves . 
 the addition of cross polarization does not alter the existing property . + 
 secondly we have applied test scalar field to the background cpbs spacetime . 
 the effect of scalar field on the qr singularity is stronger than the effect of em test field case . 
 we have obtained that the qr singularity is unstable and transformes into a scs . to check the validity of the conjecture 
 , we have constructed a new solution constituting an exact back reaction solution to the test scalar field in the cpbs spacetime . 
 the solution represents the collision of cross polarized em field coupled to a scalar field . 
 an examination of weyl and maxwell scalars shows that @xmath142 and @xmath143 diverge as the singularity is approached and unlike the test em field case the conjecture predicts the nature of singularity formed correctly . 
 + finally , we have introduced test null dusts into the interaction region of cpbs spacetime . the conjecture predicts that the ch are unstable and transforms into scs . 
 this result is compared with the exact back - reaction solution and observed that the conjecture works . 
 to determine the type of singularity in the incoming region of cpbs spacetime , the riemann tensor in local and in ppon frame must be evaluated . 
 non - zero riemann tensors in local coordinates are found as follows . 
 @xmath144 \nonumber \\ 
 -r_{uyuy}&= & e^{-u - v } \left [ \phi_{22 } coshw + ( i m \psi_4 ) sinhw - re \psi_4    \right ] \nonumber \\ r_{uxuy}&= & e^{-u}\left [ \phi_{22 } sinhw + ( im\psi_4)coshw\right]\end{aligned}\ ] ] where @xmath145 \nonumber \\ i m \psi_4&=&-\frac{i}{2}\left(w_{uu } -u_uw_u + m_uw_u -v^2_u coshw sinhw   \right ) \nonumber \\ \phi_{22}&=&\frac{1}{4}\left(2u_{uu}-u^2_u - w^2_u - v^2_u cosh^2w \right)\end{aligned}\ ] ] note that in region ii the weyl scalar @xmath146 , therefore only @xmath143 exists . 
 it is clear that @xmath147 in the limit @xmath27 , so that all of the components vanish @xmath148 to find the riemann tensor in a ppon frame , we define the following ppon frame vectors ; @xmath149 in this frame the non - zero components of the riemann tensors are : @xmath150 in the limit of @xmath27 , we have the following results @xmath151 which are all finite . 
 this indicates that the apparent singularity in region ii ( one of the incoming region ) is a quasiregular singularity . 
 in order to calculate the weyl and maxwell scalars we make use of the cx line element @xmath152 where @xmath153 @xmath154 is given in equation ( 4 ) and we have chosen @xmath155 , such that the new coordinates @xmath156 are related to @xmath157 by @xmath158 the weyl and maxwell scalars are found as @xmath159 \\ & & \nonumber \\ \psi_0&=&-e^{\gamma - i\lambda } \left [ 3r   + \frac{1}{4f\sigma \sin \theta

"nuclear multifragmentation is presently intensely studied both theoretically and experimentally . due to the similitude existent between the nucleon - nucleon interaction and the van der waals forces , signs of a liquid - gas phase transition in nuclear matter 
 are searched . while the theoretical calculations concerning this problem started at the beginning of 1980 @xcite , the first experimental evaluation of the nuclear caloric curve was reported in 1995 by the aladin group @xcite . a wide plateau situated at around 5 mev temperature lasting from 3 to 
 10 mev / nucleon excitation energy was identified . 
 the fact was obviously associated with the possible existence of a liquid - gas phase transition in nuclear matter and generated new motivations for further theoretical and experimental work . 
 similar experiments of eos @xcite and indra @xcite followed shortly . using different reactions they obtained slightly different caloric curves , the plateau - like region being absent in the majority of cases . 
 factors contributing to these discrepancies are both the precision of the experimental measurements and the finite - size effects of the caloric curve manifested through the dependency of the equilibrated sources [ @xmath5 sequence on the reaction type . 
 concerning the first point of view , recent reevaluations of the aladin group concerning the kinetic energies of the emitted neutrons brought corrections of about 10 @xmath6 ( in the case of the reaction @xmath1au+@xmath1au , 600 mev / nucleon ) . 
 more importantly however it was proven that the energies of the spectator parts are growing with approximately 30 @xmath6 in the bombarding energy interval 600 to 1000 mev / nucleon . on the other side , the universality of the quantity @xmath7 subject to 
 the bombarding energy variation ( which was theoretically proven @xcite to be a signature of statistical equilibrium ) suggests that for the above - mentioned reactions the equilibrated sources sequence [ @xmath5 should be the same . 
 consequently , we deal with an important nonequilibrium part included in the measured source excitation energies which may belong to both pre - equilibrium or pre - break - up stages @xcite . 
 the smm calculations suggest a significant quantity of nonequilibrium energy even in the case of the 600 mev / nucleon bombarding energy reaction @xcite . 
 thus , the necessity of accurate theoretical descriptions of the break - up stage and of the sequential secondary particle emission appears to be imperative in order to distinguish between the equilibrium and nonequilibrium parts of the measured excitation energies . 
 these approaches should strictly obey the constrains of the physical system which , in the case of nuclear multifragmentation , are purely microcanonic . 
 as we previously underlined @xcite , in spite of their success in reproducing some experimental data , the two widely used statistical multifragmentation models ( smm @xcite and mmmc @xcite ) are not strictly satisfying the microcanonical rules . 
 the present paper describes some refinements and improvements brought to the sharp microcanonical multifragmentation model proposed in @xcite and also the employment of the model in its new version in the interpretation of the recent experimental data of the aladin group @xcite . 
 the improvements brought to the model @xcite are presented in section ii . 
 section iii presents the new evaluations of temperature curves and the first evaluations ( performed with this model ) of heat capacities at constant volume ( @xmath8 ) represented as a function of system excitation energy and temperature and also the comparison between the model predictions and the recent experimental heli isotopic temperature curve [ @xmath9 @xcite . 
 conclusions are drawn in section iv . 
 the improvements brought to the microcanonical multifragmentation model concerns both the _ break - up _ stage and the _ secondary particle emission _ stage . 
 + ( i ) _ primary break - up refinements _ + comparing to the version of ref.@xcite the present model has the following new features : + ( a ) the experimental discrete energy levels are replacing the level density for fragments with @xmath10 ( in the previous version of the model a thomas fermi type level density formula was used for all particle excited states ) . in this respect , in the statistical weight of a configuration and the correction factor formulas @xcite the level density functions are replaced by the degeneracies of the discrete levels , @xmath11 ( here @xmath12 denotes the spin of the @xmath13th excited level ) . as a criterion for level selection ( i.e. the level life - time must be greater than the typical time of a fragmentation event ) we used @xmath14 1 mev , where @xmath15 is the width of the energy level . + ( b ) in the case of the fragments with @xmath16 the level density formula is modified as to take into account the strong decrease of the fragments excited states life - time ( reported to the standard duration of a fragmentation event ) with the increase of their excitation energy . to this aim the thomas fermi type formula @xcite is completed with the factor @xmath17 ( see ref.@xcite ) : @xmath18 where @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 . 
 + ( ii ) _ inclusion of the secondary decay stage _ + for the @xmath22 nuclei it was observed that the fragments excitation energies are sufficiently small such as the sequential evaporation scheme is perfectly applicable . according to weisskopf theory @xcite ( extended as to account for particles larger than @xmath23 ) , the probability of emitting a particle @xmath24 from an excited nucleus is proportional to the quantity : @xmath25 where @xmath26 are the stable excited states of the fragment @xmath24 subject to particle emission ( their upper limit is generally around 7 - 8 mev ) , @xmath27 is the kinetic energy of the formed pair in the center of mass ( c.m . ) 
 frame , @xmath28 is the degeneracy of the level @xmath13 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 are respectively the reduced mass of the pair and the separation energy of the particle @xmath24 and finally @xmath31 is the inverse reaction cross - section . due to the specificity of the multifragmentation calculations we considered the range of the emitted fragments @xmath24 up to the @xmath32 limit . for the inverse reaction cross - section we have used the optical model based parametrization from ref . 
 the sequential evaporation process is simulated by means of standard monte carlo ( see for example @xcite ) .    for nuclei with @xmath33 ( the only excited states of @xmath34 nuclei taken into consideration are few states higher than 20 mev belonging to the @xmath23 particle ) depending on their amount of excitation we consider _ secondary break - up _ for @xmath35 and weisskopf evaporation otherwise ( here @xmath36 is the excitation energy of the fragment @xmath37 and @xmath38 is its binding energy ) . 
 the microcanonical weight formulas have the usual form @xcite excepting the level density functions which are here replaced by the discrete levels degeneracies . due to the reduced dimensions of the @xmath39 systems , 
 the break - up channels are countable ( and a classical monte carlo simulation is appropriate ) when a mean field approach is used for the coulomb interaction energy . in this respect , 
 the wigner - seitz approach @xcite is employed for the coulomb interaction : @xmath40 where @xmath41 and @xmath42 denotes the mass and the charge of the source nucleus , the resulting fragments have the index @xmath13 , @xmath43^{1/3}$ ] and @xmath44 . here 
 @xmath45 denotes the break - up volume and @xmath46 the volume of the nucleus at normal density 
 . it should be added that @xmath47 is the radius of the source nucleus at break - up and @xmath48 is the radius of fragment @xmath13 at normal density .    for each event of the primary break - up simulation , 
 the entire chain of evaporation and secondary break - up events is monte carlo simulated . 
 using the improved version of the microcanonical multifragmentation model , the caloric curves corresponding to two freeze - out radii ( r=2.25 a@xmath49 and r=2.50 a@xmath49 fm ) are reevaluated for the case of the source nucleus ( 70 , 32 ) ( the microcanonical caloric curves evaluated with the initial version of the model are given in ref . 
 these are presented in fig . 
 1 ( a ) . one can observe that the main features of the caloric curve from refs . 
 @xcite are reobtained . 
 thus , one can recognize the liquid - like region at the beginning of the caloric curve , then a large plateau - like region and finally the linearly increasing gas - like region . 
 one may also notice that the caloric curve behavior at the freeze - out radius variation is maintained : the decrease of the freeze - out radius leads to a global lifting of the caloric curve . 
 as it is well known , the curves of the constant volume heat capacity ( @xmath8 ) as a function of system excitation energy ( @xmath50 ) and as a function of temperature ( @xmath51 ) may provide important information concerning the transition region and the transition order . 
 for this reason the curves @xmath52 and @xmath53 have been evaluated ( see fig . 
 1 ( a ) and fig . 1 ( b ) ) . 
 we remind that the constant volume heat capacity ( @xmath8 ) is calculable in the present model using the formula @xcite : @xmath54 ^ 2\right>+t^2\left<\left(\frac32 n_c- \frac52\right )      \frac1{k^2}\right>.\ ] ] it can be observed that the @xmath52 curve has a sharp maximum around 4.5 mev / nucleon excitation energy for both considered freeze - out radii . 
 this suggests that a phase transition exists in that region . 
 the transition temperatures can be very well distinguished by analyzing the @xmath53 . 
 one can observe two sharp - peaked maxima pointing the transition temperatures corresponding to the two considered freeze - out radii .    in order to make a direct comparison between the calculated heli isotopic temperature and the recent experimental results @xcite one has to deduce the sequence of excitation energy as a function of the system dimension [ @xmath5 . this is done as in refs . 
 @xcite using as matching criterion the simultaneously reproduction of the @xmath55 and @xmath56 curves . 
 this couple of curves can fairly well identify the dimension and the excitation of the equilibrated nuclear source @xcite . here 
 @xmath2 stands for the multiplicity of intermediate mass fragments and is defined as the number of fragments with @xmath57 from a fragmentation event while @xmath3 denotes the charge asymmetry of the two largest fragments and , for one fragmentation event is defined as @xmath58 with @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the maximum charge of a fragment and @xmath61 is the second largest charge of a fragment in the respective event . 
 @xmath4 represents the _ bound charge _ in one fragmentation event and is defined as the sum of the charges of all fragments with @xmath62 . 
 the simultaneous fit of the calculated curves @xmath55 and @xmath56 on the corresponding experimental data ( @xmath1au+@xmath1au at 1000 mev / nucleon ) is given in fig . 
 the agreement is very good . 
 the equilibrated source sequence [ @xmath5 we used for this purpose is given in fig . 
 3 together with the experimental evaluations of the excitation energies as a function of source dimension for the reaction @xmath1au+@xmath1au at 600 , 800 and 1000 mev / nucleon . 
 the theoretically obtained sequence is relatively close to the experimental line corresponding to 600 mev / nucleon bombarding energy . 
 the deviations between the calculated equilibrated source sequence and the three experimental lines suggest that the experimental evaluations contain a quantity of non - equilibrium energy which grows with increasing the bombarding energy . as suggested in ref . 
 @xcite , its origin may be situated in both the pre - equilibrium and pre - break - up stage . 
 these deviations are exclusively due to the neutron kinetic energies which , reevaluated @xcite from the 1995 data @xcite , are much larger . 
 it should also be pointed that apart from the smm predictions @xcite , the quantity of non - equilibrium energy predicted by the present model is smaller and thus the model predicted equilibrated source sequence is closer to the experimental line of the 600 mev / nucleon bombarding energy reaction .    after evaluating the sequence of the equilibrated sources a direct comparison the heli calculated isotopic temperature curve with the ones recently evaluated by the aladin group @xcite is performed . to this purpose the uncorrected albergo temperature is used : @xmath63 $ ] , the experimental predictions being divided by @xmath64 ( which is the factor used in the aladin evaluation of the heli caloric curve chosen as to average the qsm , gemini and mmmc models predictions ) . 
 the result is represented in fig . 
 4 as a function of @xmath4 . 
 it can be observed that the agreement between the calculated @xmath65 and the experimental data corresponding to the @xmath1au+@xmath1au reaction at 600 and 1000 mev / nucleon bombarding energy is excellent on the entire range of @xmath4 . in comparison 
 , the smm model predicts in the region @xmath66 a curve steeper than the experimental data . 
 sumarizing , the microcanonical multifragmentation model from ref . 
 @xcite is improved by refining the primary break - up part and by including the secondary particle emission . 
 the caloric curve rededuced with the new version of the model preserves its general aspect @xcite manifesting an important plateau - like region . 
 the transition regions are clearly indicated by the sharp maxima of the @xmath52 and @xmath53 curves . 
 the model proves the ability of simultaneously fitting the `` definitory '' characteristics of the nuclear multifragmentation phenomenon @xmath55 and @xmath56 . evaluating the equilibrated source sequence @xmath67 [ by using the criterion of reproducing both @xmath68 and @xmath69 versus @xmath70 , a nonequilibrium part of the experimentally evaluated excitation energy growing with the increase of the bombarding energy 
 is identified . 
 the direct comparison of the calculated heli caloric curve shows an excellent agreement with the experimental heli curves recently evaluated by the aladin group .

 the sequence of equilibrated sources formed in the reactions studied by the aladin group ( @xmath1au+@xmath1au at 600 , 800 and 1000 mev / nucleon bombarding energy ) is deduced by fitting simultaneously the model predicted mean multiplicity of intermediate mass fragments ( @xmath2 ) and charge asymmetry of the two largest fragments ( @xmath3 ) versus bound charge ( @xmath4 ) on the corresponding experimental data . 
 calculated heli isotopic temperature curves as a function of the bound charge are compared with the experimentally deduced ones .",arxiv
"the @xmath0-invariance of the maxwell equation was discovered by cunningham and bateman a century ago . 
 however in order to quantize the maxwell field and due to gauge freedom , a gauge fixing condition is necessary . 
 the lorenz gauge is usually used , which breaks the @xmath0 invariance . 
 nonetheless since such a symmetry mights apear to lack physical meaning , its breaking does not bother many people @xcite . 
 the purpose of the present paper is to demonstrate the benefits of keeping this fundamental symmetry when quantizing the maxwell field in conformally flat spaces ( cfs ) . 
 the starting point is the following . 
 a classical @xmath0-invariant field can not , at least locally , distinguish between two cfss @xcite . 
 so why not maintain the @xmath0-invariance during the quantization process in a cfs ? 
 doing so , a free field living in a cfs might behave like in a flat space and the corresponding wightman two - point functions can be related to their minkowskian counterparts . 
 the work @xcite confirms this assertion in the special case of maxwell field in de sitter space . 
 indeed , a new and simple two - point wightman function @xmath1 was found and which has the same physical ( gauge independent ) content as the two - point function of allen and jacobson @xcite . 
 this is because the faraday propagator @xmath2 is the same . 
 the present work extends to general cfss and clarify the quantum structure of the formalism developed in @xcite . 
 we use dirac s six - cone formalism and realize all cfss as intersections of the null cone and a given surface in a six - dimensional lorentzian space . 
 the introduction of auxiliary fields and the use of the gubta - bleuler quantization scheme are necessary to deal with gauge freedom of the maxwell field . 
 another important ingredient is the use of a well - suited coordinate system . 
 this allows to @xmath0-invariant cfs formulas to get a minkowskian form . 
 the main result is a set of wightman two - point functions for maxwell and auxiliary fields . 
 this paper is organized as follows . 
 [ geom ] sets the coordinates systems and the geometrical construction of cfss . 
 [ fields ] defines the fields and gives their dynamical equations . in sec . 
 [ quantum - field ] , the dynamical system is solved , the quantum field is explicitly constructed and the two - point functions are written down . 
 some technical details are given in appdx . 
 [ details ] . 
 the infinitesimal @xmath0 action on the fields @xmath3 is expanded in appdx . 
 [ action ] and their @xmath0-invariant scalar product is given in appdx . 
 the six - dimensional lorentzian space @xmath4 is provided with the natural orthogonal coordinates @xmath5 and equipped with the metric @xmath6 . 
 quantities related to @xmath4 and its null cone @xmath7 are labeled with a tilde . 
 we define a second coordinate system @xmath8 , @xmath9 where the four components @xmath10 is the so - called polyspherical coordinate system @xcite and @xmath11 . a straightforward calculation yields @xmath12 which means that the component @xmath13 carries alone the homogeneity of the @xmath14 s . 
 using the system @xmath15 , the null cone reads @xmath16 a five - dimensional surface in @xmath4 is defined through @xmath17 where the real and smooth function @xmath18 depends only on @xmath10 and @xmath19 and is then homogeneous of degree @xmath20 . 
 the intersection of @xmath21 and @xmath22 is a four - dimensional space @xmath23 where the index @xmath24 in @xmath25 refers to @xmath26 ) . 
 regarding to its metric inherited from @xmath27 , precisely @xmath28 @xmath25 turns out to be a cfs . 
 a smooth move of the surface @xmath29 , which corresponds to changing the function @xmath30 , amounts to perform a weyl rescaling . 
 this locally relates all cfss and permits to go from one to another . 
 note that for @xmath31 , @xmath25 reduces to minkowski space @xmath32 and accordingly the four components system @xmath10 yields the usual cartesian system . 
 the gradients @xmath33 are extensivelly used in this article . 
 the function @xmath30 does not depend on @xmath13 and thus @xmath34 . 
 the choice of the function @xmath30 , including its @xmath19 dependence has to be done in such a way to ensure the invariance ( in @xmath4 ) of the surface @xmath22 under the action of the isometry group associated to the desired @xmath25 four - dimensional space . since the @xmath4 null - cone is @xmath0-invariant , the resulting @xmath25 will be invariant under its isometry group . 
 let us consider an example : @xmath35^{-1}$ ] , where @xmath36 is a constant . 
 the associated surface @xmath22 and thus the corresponding @xmath25 are left invariant under the action of de sitter group @xcite . 
 also , @xmath25 is a de sitter space . 
 in this section , we explain how to obtain the @xmath0-invariant maxwell field in @xmath25 from a six - dimensional one - form . following dirac @xcite 
 , we consider a one - form @xmath37 defined in @xmath4 homogeneous of degree @xmath38 and which decomposes on the @xmath39 basis as @xmath40 the components @xmath41 are homogeneous of degree @xmath42 and obey to the equation @xmath43 this equation is naturally invariant under the @xmath0 action since this group has a linear action when acting in @xmath4 . 
 we then decompose the one - form @xmath37 on the basis @xmath44 corresponding to the system @xmath45 ( [ coord+muc ] ) , with a slight but capital modification on the @xmath46 component . 
 there are two ways , the first decomposition reads @xmath47 the second is given by @xmath48 now , identifying ( [ eq-1 ] ) with ( [ eq-2 ] ) , one obtains the relation between the fields @xmath49 and @xmath50 through @xmath51 all the fields @xmath52 and @xmath53 are by construction homogeneous of degree @xmath54 . as a consequence , @xmath55 and @xmath56 
 this amounts to project the fields @xmath52 on @xmath57 and @xmath53 on @xmath58 . then projecting the fields on the null cone @xmath21 yields @xmath59 thus @xmath60 and @xmath61 are respectively @xmath25 and minkowski fields . 
 though in a slightly different maner , this relation was obtained in @xcite in the particular case of de sitter space and was called the `` extended weyl transformation '' . 
 the fields @xmath62 and @xmath63 are auxiliary fields and the field @xmath64 is , up to the condition @xmath65 the maxwell field . 
 this will become clear here after . 
 let us now turn to the dynamical equations . 
 our strategy is to transport minkowskian @xmath0-invariant equations to get @xmath0-invariant equations in the @xmath25 space . 
 the first step is thus to write down the minkowskian equations which are obtained using the equation ( [ equation - a ] ) and the relation ( [ a(a)-m ] ) . 
 this system reads @xmath66 the corresponding system in @xmath25 is obtained using ( [ extendedweyl - bis ] ) , @xmath67 where all contractions are performed using @xmath68 even though we are in the curved space @xmath25 . 
 the field @xmath69 obeying to the system above is not yet the maxwell one . 
 nevertheless , the constraint @xmath70 simplifies the system ( [ syst1m - h ] ) and leads to @xmath71 despite their minkowskian form , these equations are the maxwell equation and a conformal gauge condition on any conformally flat space . this is due to the use of the polyspherical coordinate system ( [ coord+muc ] ) , which makes apparent the flatness feature of the @xmath25 spaces . 
 the constraint @xmath72 reduces the extended weyl transformation ( [ extendedweyl - bis ] ) into the identity @xmath73 recovering the ordinary vanishing conformal weight of the maxwell field @xmath69 . after some algebra , the covariant form of ( [ maxwellh1 ] ) takes the form @xmath74 where @xmath75 . the first line ( resp . 
 the second one ) is the covariant maxwell ( resp . 
 the eastwood - singer gauge @xcite ) equation in an arbitrary @xmath25 space . 
 this conformal gauge was first derived by bayen and flato in minkowski space @xcite . 
 its extension to curved spaces ( even cfss ) is not trivial and can be performed using adapted tools like the weyl - gauging technique @xcite or the weyl - to - riemann method @xcite . 
 note that the system ( [ system - covariant ] ) is valid only if @xmath76 ( an @xmath0-invariant constraint ) . 
 but the latter has to be fixed at the end of the quantization process , not at the begining . 
 indeed , the auxiliary field @xmath77 acts as a faddeev popov ghost field and its retention during the quantization process is necessary . 
 the constraint @xmath76 will be applied on the quantum space to select an invariant subspace of physical states and the wightman functions thus include the whole big space . 
 this is related to the undecomposable group representation ( see appendix [ action ] ) . 
 we now apply the gupta - bleuler quantization scheme @xcite . 
 this can be summarized as follows . 
 we have seen that @xmath78 is interpreted as the maxwell field in the eastwood - singer gauge ( [ system - covariant ] ) on the space @xmath79 when the constraint @xmath80 is applied . 
 the problem is that pure gauge solutions ( @xmath81 , with @xmath82 and @xmath80 ) are orthogonal to all the solutions including themselves . as a consequence , 
 the space of solutions is degenerate and no wightman functions can be constructed . to fix this problem , we consider the system ( [ syst1m - h ] ) , instead of ( [ system - covariant ] ) , for which @xmath83 and thus a causal reproducing kernel can be found . 
 this means that for quantum fields @xmath84 acting on some hilbert ( or krein ) space @xmath85 , we can not impose the operator equation @xmath86 . 
 instead , we define the subspace of physical states @xmath87 which cancels the action of @xmath88 . then the maxwell equation and the eastwood - singer gauge hold in the mean on the space @xmath89 . 
 the task seems complicated at first sight , but thanks to the correspondence ( [ extendedweyl - bis ] ) we only need to solve the minkowskian system ( [ syst1 m ] ) , which is already done in @xcite . 
 indeed , using the weyl equivalence between cfss , the whole structure of an @xmath90-covariant free field theory can be transported from minkowski to another cfs . in the following , 
 we solve the dynamical equations , obtain the modes , determine the quantum field , the subspace of physical states and finally compute the two - point functions .      the solutions of the minkowskian system ( [ syst1 m ] ) can be obtained from @xcite and read @xmath91 where @xmath92 are polarization vectors whose components are given by @xmath93 and verifying @xmath94 with respect to the scalar product ( [ scalarps - a ] ) . 
 the matrix @xmath95 relates the fields @xmath96 and @xmath97 ( [ matrix - s ] ) . 
 the scalar modes @xmath98 are solutions of the minkowskian @xmath0-invariant ( or massless ) sclalar field equation @xmath99 , @xmath100 where @xmath101 denotes the usual hyperspherical harmonics . 
 the normalization constant @xmath102 is chosen in order to get @xmath103 with respect to the klein - gordon scalar product . as a consequence , the solutions ( [ modes - a ] ) are normalized with respect to ( [ scalarps - a ] ) 
 , @xmath104 thus the general solution of the system ( [ syst1 m ] ) reads @xmath105 where @xmath106 are real constants . 
 let us now turn to the modes of the system ( [ syst1m - h ] ) . 
 they are obtained thanks to the extended weyl transformation ( [ extendedweyl - bis ] ) applied on the minkowskian modes ( [ modes - a ] ) @xmath107 these modes are normalized like ( [ norm ] ) but according to the scalar product ( [ scalarps - a - k ] ) . 
 the general solution on @xmath79 reads @xmath108 where the @xmath109 are some real constants . 
 note that when @xmath110 the solutions ( [ generalsolution - am ] ) and ( [ generalsolution - ak ] ) solve the maxwell equation in the eastwood - singer gauge . 
 we can now define the quantum fields and construct the fock spaces as usual . 
 the quantum fields corresponding to ( [ generalsolution - am ] ) and ( [ generalsolution - ak ] ) are respectively defined through @xmath111 @xmath112 where the operators @xmath113 and @xmath114 are respectively the annihilators and creators of the modes ( [ modes - a ] ) in @xmath32 and the modes ( [ modes - a - k ] ) in @xmath25 . 
 the use of the same annihilators and creators for all cfss is highly important for our purpose . 
 indeed , this allows to define the the same vaccuum state @xmath115 through @xmath116 for any annihilator . 
 the one - particle states are built by applying the creators on the vacuum state @xmath117 and the multiple particle states of the fock spaces are constructed as usual . 
 moreover , the annihilation and creation operators obey to the following algebra @xmath118 =    [   \hat a_{{\scriptscriptstyle l}m ( \alpha)}^{\dag } , \hat a_{{\scriptscriptstyle l}'m ' ( \beta)}^{\dag } ] = 0 \\ & [   \hat a_{{\scriptscriptstyle l}m ( \alpha ) } , \hat a_{{\scriptscriptstyle l}'m ' ( \beta)}^{\dag } ]   = -\tilde \eta_{{\scriptscriptstyle \alpha}\beta } \delta_{{\scriptscriptstyle l}l ' } \delta_{{\scriptscriptstyle m}m'}. \end{split}\ ] ]    the subset of physical states in both spaces is determined thanks to the classical physical solutions ( [ generalsolution - am ] ) and ( [ generalsolution - ak ] ) verifying ( [ a+=0 ] ) . in quantum language , @xmath119 is a physical state iff @xmath120 where @xmath121 is the annihilator part of @xmath122 . 
 this implies the equality @xmath123 for any physical states @xmath119 and @xmath124 . 
 also , the subspace of physical states is the same in all cfss , which allows to transport physical quantities from minkowski space into the @xmath25 space . as a consequence , one obtains @xmath125 in @xmath25 and the corresponding minkowskian system in @xmath32 . 
 the quantum fields fulfill the maxwell equation together with the eastwood - singer gauge in the mean on the physical states . 
 we show in this part how to get the wightman two - point functions on @xmath25 from their minkowskian counterparts . 
 the wightman functions related to the minkowskian fields @xmath126 are defined through @xmath127 their expressions are given in @xcite and read @xmath128 where @xmath129 with @xmath130 stands for the wightman two - point function related to the minkowskian massless scalar field . 
 the wightman two - point functions related to the field @xmath131 are given by @xmath132 now , using ( [ modes - a - k ] ) , ( [ maxwelds2ptdef ] ) and ( [ wightman - k ] ) , allows to write the following capital formula @xmath133 where the @xmath134 terms read @xmath135 the wightman two - point functions ( [ dk - dm ] ) read @xmath136 where @xmath137 , @xmath138 , @xmath139 and @xmath140 . 
 + to end this paper , let us consider an important particular case , that corresponding to de sitter space . 
 this case is obtained by specifying @xmath141 where @xmath142 is related to the de sitterian ricci scalar through @xmath143 . 
 the gradients ( [ upsilon ] ) read @xmath144 in this case we obtain simple expressions for the two - point functions related to the fields @xmath145 on de sitter space . 
 the three more relevant yield @xmath146 where we have used ( de sitter is a maximally symmetric space ) the standard unit tangent vectors @xmath147 and @xmath148 , the parallel propagator along the geodesic @xmath149 and the usual function @xmath150 of the geodesic distance @xmath151 relating @xmath152 and @xmath153 , @xmath154 . 
 see @xcite for a more precise statement . 
 note that the two - point function @xmath155 has the same physical content with the allen and jacobson two - point function @xcite . 
 an @xmath0-covariant quantization of the maxwell field in an arbitrary conformally flat space was presented . following dirac s six - cone formalism , all conformally flat spaces @xmath25 
 are realized as intersections of the null cone and a given surface @xmath29 . 
 the quantum field was explicitly constructed using the gupta - bleuler canonical quantization scheme and the wightman two - point functions were given . 
 the price to pay for this simplicity and the maintaining of the @xmath0 invariance during the whole quantization process was the introduction of two auxiliary fields @xmath156 and @xmath77 . 
 as a consequence , the maxwell field @xmath69 does not propagate `` alone '' but together with its two auxiliary fields . 
 the propagation must use all the wightman functions ( [ d - x - k - relevent ] ) and not only the `` purely '' maxwell one @xmath157 . 
 nonetheless , in a recent work @xcite , we have used the functions ( [ d - ds ] ) to propagate the maxwell field generated by two charges of opposite sign placed at the two poles of a de sitter space . 
 the calculations showed that only @xmath157 is involved , which trivialize the problem . 
 one can consider to use the two - point functions ( [ d - x - k - relevent ] ) to propagate the electromagnetic field for some charge distribution given in other cfss , like flrw spaces for instance . 
 one concludes that is much worth to maintain the @xmath0 symmetry during the whole quantization process when dealing with maxwell field in a conformally flat space . 
 the problem then goes back to minkowski and the calculations become much easier . 
 in fact , the classical and quantum structures of the free maxwell field are locally the same in all conformally flat spaces . 
 the remained question is to know if this is true for other free fields and how to deal with @xmath0-invariant interactions ? 
 i would like to thank m. novello , j. renaud and e. huguet for illuminating discussions and the cnpq for financial support . 
 considering ( [ field - a ] ) and ( [ eq-1 ] ) , expressing the basis @xmath159 in terms of @xmath44 and then identifying both sides , one obtains the expression of @xmath160 in terms of @xmath161 . 
 we find , after using the homogeneity properties , @xmath162 which reads @xmath163 this system can be inverted in @xmath164    following the same steps as above , one obtain the matrix linking the @xmath165 to the @xmath166 @xmath167     + a^{{\scriptscriptstyle k}}_4 [ \upsilon_c(1+x^2)-1 ]     \\ & & \qquad \qquad \qquad    + \upsilon_c a^{{\scriptscriptstyle k}}.x \biggr\ } \\     { \displaystyle a_\mu^{{\scriptscriptstyle k } } }     & = &   k   \biggl\ { a^{{\scriptscriptstyle k}}_5 \left ( ( 1 -x^2 ) \upsilon_{\mu } - \frac{1}{2}x_{\mu } \right )    \\ & &        +   a^{{\scriptscriptstyle k}}_4 \left ( ( 1 + x^2 ) \upsilon_{\mu } + \frac{1}{2 } x_{\mu } \right )   + a^{{\scriptscriptstyle k}}_\nu \left ( \upsilon_{\mu } x^\nu + \delta_{\mu}^{\nu } \right ) \biggr\ } \\   { \displaystyle   a_+^{{\scriptscriptstyle k } } }    & = & { \displaystyle k \biggl\{a^{{\scriptscriptstyle k}}_5 ( 1- x^2 ) } + a^{{\scriptscriptstyle k}}_4 ( 1 + x^2 ) + a^{{\scriptscriptstyle k}}.x \biggr\}.     \end{array } \right .\ ] ] this system can be obtained using the minkowskian system ( [ a(a)-m ] ) , the relation @xmath168 ( which comes out from the homogeneity properties of the fields ) and the extended weyl transformations ( [ extendedweyl - bis ] ) . 
 this is inverted in @xmath169 
 the @xmath0 infinitesimal action on the field @xmath3 is given by commutators of the group generators and the field . 
 first , we write down the infinitesimal transformations of the minkowskian fields @xmath96 which can be found in @xcite then we transport the resulting representation into @xmath25 . for any element @xmath170 
 , the related generator is denoted by @xmath171 and whose action on the field @xmath96 reads @xmath172 \\ &   = x_{e } \ 
 a_{{\scriptscriptstyle i}}^{{\scriptscriptstyle m } }   + \left ( \sigma_{e }   \right)_{{\scriptscriptstyle i}}^{{\scriptscriptstyle j } } \ 
 a_{{\scriptscriptstyle j}}^{{\scriptscriptstyle m } } \end{split}\ ] ] where the first part represents the scalar action and the second the spinorial action . setting @xmath173 
 the minkowskian infinitessimal action reads @xmath174 } \ 
 a^{{\scriptscriptstyle m}}_\tau   \\ &   \left ( x_{\mu\nu}^{{\scriptscriptstyle m } } \ 
 a^{{\scriptscriptstyle m}}\right)_+ =   x_{\mu\nu } a^{{\scriptscriptstyle m}}_+ , \end{aligned } \right.\ ] ] for the rotations , @xmath175 for the translations ; @xmath176}^\lambda   + x^\lambda \eta_{\mu\nu } ) a^{{\scriptscriptstyle m}}_\lambda - 2\eta_{\mu\nu } a^{{\scriptscriptstyle m}}_+     \\ & \left(k_\mu^{{\scriptscriptstyle m } } \ 
 a^{{\scriptscriptstyle m}}\right)_+ = k_\mu a^{{\scriptscriptstyle m}}_+ , \end{aligned } \right.\ ] ] for the special conformal transformations ( sct ) . 
 finally , we have @xmath177 for the dilations . 
 the undecomposable structure of the fields @xmath96 is made clear . under the @xmath0 action 
 , the component @xmath178 overlaps @xmath179 which in turn overlaps @xmath180 . 
 so we have the scheme @xmath181    the second step is to trasport the group action from minkowski to the @xmath79 space using the extended weyl transformation ( [ extendedweyl - bis ] ) @xmath182 a_{+}^{{\scriptscriptstyle k } } \end{split}\ ] ] where we have used @xmath183 for all @xmath184 . 
 also only the second part of the last line has to be computed . 
 note that the constraint @xmath189 ( [ a+=0 ] ) is @xmath0-invariant . 
 this is important since this constraint defines the subset of physical states . 
 the @xmath0-invariant scalar product for the minkowskian field @xmath96 reads @xmath190 where @xmath191 is some cauchy surface in @xmath32 and @xmath192 is a surface element . 
 an important point is that this cauchy surface is common to all the spaces @xmath25 since they are all conformally equivalent @xcite .    using ( [ lien - weyl ] ) and 
 ( [ extendedweyl - bis ] ) , the scalar product for the field @xmath166 is obtained from ( [ scalarps - a ] ) and reads @xmath193 where the @xmath25 surface element is related to its minkoskian counterpart by @xmath194 .","we present an @xmath0-covariant quantization of the free electromagnetic field in conformally flat spaces ( cfs ) . 
 a cfs is realized in a six - dimensional space as an intersection of the null cone with a given surface . 
 the smooth move of the latter is equivalent to perform a weyl rescaling . 
 this allows to transport the @xmath0-invariant quantum structure of the maxwell field from minkowski space to any cfs . 
 calculations are simplified and the cfs wightman two - point functions are given in terms of their minkowskian counterparts . 
 the difficulty due to gauge freedom is surpassed by introducing two auxiliary fields and using the gupta - bleuler quantization scheme . 
 the quantum structure is given by a vacuum state and creators / annihilators acting on some hilbert space . 
 in practice , only the hilbert space changes under weyl rescalings . also the quantum @xmath0-invariant free maxwell field 
 does not distinguish between two cfss .",arxiv
"thanks to a fortunate coincidence of observations by agile , _ fermi _ , and _ swift _ satellites , together with the optical observations by the vlt / fors2 and the nordic optical telescope , it has been possible to obtain an unprecedented set of data , extending from the optical - uv , through the x - rays , all the way up to the high energy ( gev ) emission , which allowed detailed temporal / spectral analyses on grb 090510 @xcite . 
 in contrast with this outstanding campaign of observations , a theoretical analysis of the broadband emission of grb 090510 has been advanced within the synchrotron / self - synchrotron compton ( ssc ) and traditional afterglow models ( see , e.g. , sections 5.2.1 and 5.2.2 in * ? ? ? * ) . 
 paradoxically , this same methodology has been applied in the description of markedly different type of sources : e.g. , @xcite for the low energetic long grb 060218 , @xcite for the high energetic long grb 130427a , and @xcite for the s - grf 051221a .    in the meantime , it has become evident that grbs can be subdivided into a variety of classes and sub - classes @xcite , each of them characterized by specific different progenitors which deserve specific theoretical treatments and understanding . in addition 
 every sub - class shows different episodes corresponding to specifically different astrophysical processes , which can be identified thanks to specific theoretical treatments and data analysis . in this article , we take grb 090510 as a prototype for s - grbs and perform a new time - resoved spectral analysis , in excellent agreement with the above temporal and spectral analysis performed by , e.g. , the _ fermi _ team . 
 now this analysis , guided by a theoretical approach successfully tested in this new family of s - grbs @xcite , is directed to identify a precise sequence of different events made possible by the exceptional quality of the data of grb 090510 . 
 this include a new structure in the thermal emission of the p - grb emission , followed by the onset of the gev emission linked to the bh formation , allowing , as well , to derive the structure of the circumburst medium from the spiky structure of the prompt emission . 
 this sequence , for the first time , illustrates the formation process of a bh . 
 already in february 1974 , soon after the public announcement of the grb discovery @xcite , @xcite presented the possible relation of grbs with the vacuum polarization process around a kerr - newman bh . 
 there , evidence was given for : a ) the formation of a vast amount @xmath2-baryon plasma ; b ) the energetics of grbs to be of the order of @xmath11  erg , where @xmath12 is the bh mass ; c ) additional ultra - high energy cosmic rays with energy up to @xmath13  ev originating from such extreme process . 
 a few years later , the role of an @xmath2 plasma of comparable energetics for the origin of grbs was considered by @xcite and it took almost thirty years to clarify some of the analogies and differences between these two processes leading , respectively , to the alternative concepts of  fireball "" and  fireshell "" @xcite . in this article we give the first evidence for the formation of a kerr newman bh , in grb 090510 , from the merger of two massive nss in a binary system . 
 grbs are usually separated in two categories , based on their duration properties . 
 short grbs have a duration @xmath14 s while the remaining ones with @xmath15 s are traditionally classified as long grbs . 
 short grbs are often associated to ns - ns mergers ( see e.g.  @xcite ; see also @xcite for a recent review ) : their host galaxies are of both early- and late - type , their localization with respect to the host galaxy often indicates a large offset @xcite or a location of minimal star - forming activity with typical circumburst medium ( cbm ) densities of @xmath16@xmath17 @xmath18 , and no supernovae ( sne ) have ever been associated to them . 
 the progenitors of long grbs , on the other hand , have been related to massive stars @xcite . however , in spite of the fact that most massive stars are found in binary systems @xcite , that most type ib / c sne occur in binary systems @xcite and that sne associated to long grbs are indeed of type ib / c @xcite , the effects of binarity on long grbs have been for a long time largely ignored in the literature . 
 indeed , until recently , long grbs have been interpreted as single events in the jetted _ collapsar _ fireball model ( see e.g.  @xcite and references therein ) . 
 multiple components evidencing the presence of a precise sequence of different astrophysical processes have been found in several long grbs ( e.g.  @xcite , @xcite ) . following this discovery , further results led to the introduction of a new paradigm expliciting the role of binary sources as progenitors of the long grb - sn connection . 
 new developments have led to the formulation of the induced gravitational collapse ( igc ) paradigm @xcite . 
 the igc paradigm explains the grb - sn connection in terms of the interactions between an evolved carbon - oxygen core ( co@xmath19 ) undergoing a sn explosion and its hypercritical accretion on a binary ns companion @xcite . 
 the large majority of long bursts is related to sne and are spatially correlated with bright star - forming regions in their host galaxies @xcite with a typical cbm density of @xmath20 @xmath18 @xcite . 
 a new situation has occurred with the observation of the high energy gev emission by the _ 
 fermi_-lat instrument and its correlation with both long and short bursts with isotropic energy @xmath21 erg , which has been evidenced in @xcite and @xcite , respectively . on the basis of this correlation 
 the occurrence of such prolonged gev emission has been identified with the onset of the formation of a bh @xcite . 
 as recalled above , the long grbs associated to sne have been linked to the hypercritical accretion process occurring in a tight binary system when the ejecta of an exploding co@xmath19 accretes onto a ns binary companion ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ? 
 * ; * ? ? ? 
 * ; * ? ? ? 
 when the hypercritical accretion occurs in a widely separated system with an orbital separation @xmath22  cm @xcite , the accretion is not sufficient to form a bh . for these softer systems with rest - frame 
 spectral peak energy @xmath23 kev the upper limit of their observed energy is @xmath24 erg , which corresponds to the maximum energy attainable in the accretion onto a ns @xcite . 
 such long a burst corresponds to an x - ray flash ( xrf ) . 
 the associated x - ray afterglow is also explainable in terms of the interaction of the prompt emission with the sn ejecta ( fryer et al . 
 , in preparation ) . in these systems 
 no gev emission is expected in our theory and , indeed , is not observed . 
 interestingly , a pioneering evidence for such an x - ray flash had already been given in a different context by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite . 
 for tighter binaries ( @xmath25  cm , @xcite ) , the hypercritical accretion onto the companion ns leads to the formation of a bh . for these harder systems with @xmath26 kev the lower limit of their observed energy is @xmath24 erg , which necessarily needs the accretion process into a bh . 
 an associated prolonged gev emission occurs after the p - grb emission and at the beginning of the prompt emission , and originates at the onset of the bh formation @xcite . 
 these more energetic events are referred to as binary - driven hypernovae ( bdhne ) . 
 specific constant power - law behaviors are observed in their high energy gev , x - rays , and optical luminosity light curves @xcite .    in total analogy , the formation of a bh can occur in short bursts , depending on the mass of the merged core of the binary system . 
 when the two ns masses are large enough , the merged core can exceed the ns critical mass and the bh formation is possible . in the opposite case , 
 a massive ns ( mns ) is created , possibly , with some additional orbiting material to guarantee the angular momentum conservation . 
 we then naturally expect the existence of two short bursts sub - classes : authentic short grbs ( s - grbs ) , characterized by the formation of a bh @xcite , with @xmath21 erg , a harder spectrum ( see section [ epeakeiso ] ) and associated with a prolonged gev emission ( see section [ gevemission ] ) ; short gamma - ray flashes ( s - grfs ) , producing a mns @xcite , with @xmath27 erg . in this second sub - class , of course , the gev emission should not occur and , indeed , is never observed .    , where @xmath28 is the critical value for vacuum polarization and @xmath29 is the electric field strength . 
 the plot assumes a black hole mass energy @xmath30 . 
 figure reproduced from @xcite with their kind permission . ]    following the discovery of the first prototype of this s - grb class , namely grb 090227b @xcite , the first detailed analysis of such a genuine short grb originating from a binary ns merger leading to a bh was done for grb 140619b by @xcite , determining as well the estimated emission of gravitational waves . 
 the latter has been estimated following the method applied by @xcite for grb 090227b . 
 from the spectral analysis of the early @xmath31 s , they inferred an observed temperature @xmath32 kev of the @xmath2 plasma at transparency ( p - grb ) , a theoretically derived redshift @xmath33 , a total burst energy @xmath34 erg , a rest - frame peak energy @xmath35 mev , a baryon load @xmath36 , and an average cbm density @xmath37 @xmath18 . 
 we turn in this article to the most interesting case of grb 090510 which has , in addition to very similar properties of the members of this new class of s - grb sources , a spectroscopically determined value of the redshift and represents one of the most energetic sources of this family both in the @xmath38-ray and in the gev ranges . 
 actually , a first attempt to analyze grb 090510 was made by interpreting this source as a long grb @xcite . 
 an unusually large value of the cbm density was needed in order to fit the data : this interpretation was soon abandoned when it was noticed that grb 090510 did not fulfill the nesting conditions of the late x - ray emission typical of long grbs @xcite , see also section [ xray ] and figure [ episode3 ] .    in light of the recent progress in the understanding of the fireshell theory , 
 we address the interpretation of grb 090510 as the merging of a binary ns . 
 we give clear evidence for the validity of this interpretation . in view of the good quality of the data both in @xmath38- rays and in the gev range 
 , we have performed a more accurate description of the p - grb , best fitted by a convolution of thermal spectra . 
 this novel feature gives the first indication for the existence of an axially symmetric configuration of the dyadotorus emitting the @xmath2 plasma which had been previously theoretically considered and attentively searched for . 
 this gives the first indication that indeed the angular momentum plays a role and a dyadotorus is formed , as theoretically predicted in a series of papers ( see * ? ? ? 
 * and figure [ dyadotorus ] ) . 
 this naturally leads to the evidence for the formation of a rotating bh as the outcome of the gravitational collapse . 
 we turn then to the main new feature of grb 090510 which is the high energy @xmath6@xmath7 gev emission ( see figure [ 090510gev ] ) . 
 the direct comparison of the gev emission in this source and in the bdhne 130427a shows the remarkable similarities of these two gev components ( see figure [ 090510gev ] ) . the fact that the s - grb 090510 originates from a binary ns merger and the bdhn 130427a from the igc of a sn hypercritical accretion process onto a companion ns clearly points to the bh as originating this gev emission , the reason being that these two astrophysical systems are different in their progenitors and physical process and have in the formation of a bh their unique commonality . 
 this paper is structured as follows : in section 2 we summarize the relevant aspects of the fireshell theory and compare and contrast it with alternative approaches . in section 3 we discuss the recent progress on the ns equilibrium configuration relevant for s - grbs and bdhne . in section 4 
 we move on to describe the observations of grb 090510 and their analysis . 
 the s - grb nature of grb 090510 is justified in section 5 , and we offer an interpretation of our results in section 6 . section 7 concludes this work . 
 a standard flat @xmath39cdm cosmological model with @xmath40 and @xmath41 km s@xmath42 mpc@xmath42 is adopted throughout the paper . 
 the fireshell scenario @xcite , has been initially introduced to describe a grb originating in a gravitational collapse leading to the formation of a kerr - newman bh . 
 a distinct sequence of physical and astrophysical events are taken into account :    * an optically thick pair plasma  the fireshell of total energy @xmath43  is considered . as a result , it starts to expand and accelerate under its own internal pressure @xcite . 
 the baryonic remnant of the collapsed object is engulfed by the fireshell  the baryonic contamination is quantified by the baryon load @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the mass of the baryonic remnant @xcite . 
 * after the engulfment , the fireshell is still optically thick and continues to self - accelerate until it becomes transparent . 
 when the fireshell reaches transparency , a flash of thermal radiation termed proper - grb ( p - grb ) is emitted @xcite . * in grbs , the @xmath2-baryon plasma evolves from the ultra - relativistic region near the bh all the way reaching ultra - relativistic velocities at large distances . 
 to describe such a dynamics which deals with unprecedentedly large lorentz factors and also regimes sharply varying with time , in @xcite it has been introduced the appropriate relative spacetime transformation paradigm . 
 this paradigm gives particular attention to the constitutive equations relating four time variables : the comoving time , the laboratory time , the arrival time , and the arrival time at the detector corrected by the cosmological effects . 
 this paradigm is essential for the interpretation of the grb data : the absence of adopting such a relativistic paradigm in some current works has led to a serious misinterpretation of the grb phenomenon . * in compliance with the previous paradigm , the interactions between the ultra - relativistic shell of accelerated baryons left over after transparency and the cbm have been considered . 
 they lead to a modified blackbody spectrum in the co - moving frame @xcite . 
 the observed spectrum is however non - thermal in general ; this is due to the fact that , once the constant arrival time effect is taken into account in the equitemporal surfaces ( eqts , see * ? ? ? 
 * ; * ? ? ? 
 * ) , the observed spectral shape results from the convolution of a large number of modified thermal spectra with different lorentz factors and temperatures . * 
 all the above relativistic effects , after the p - grb emission , are necessary for the description of the prompt emission of grbs , as outlined in @xcite . the prompt emission originates in the collisions of the accelerated baryons , moving at lorentz factor @xmath46@xmath47 , with interstellar clouds of cbm with masses of @xmath48@xmath49  g , densities of @xmath50@xmath3  @xmath18 and size of @xmath51@xmath52  cm , at typical distances from the bh of @xmath53@xmath54  cm ( see , e.g. , @xcite for long bursts ) . 
 our approach differs from alternative tratments purporting late activities from the central engine ( see , e.g. , the _ collapsar _ model in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and references therein , and the _ magnetar _ model in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and references therein ) . * @xmath43 and @xmath55 are the only two parameters that are needed in a spherically symmetric fireshell model to determine the physics of the fireshell evolution until the transparency condition is fulfilled . 
 three additional parameters , all related to the properties of the cbm , are needed to reproduce a grb light curve and its spectrum : the cbm density profile @xmath56 , the filling factor @xmath57 that accounts for the size of the effective emitting area , and an index @xmath58 that accounts for the modification of the low - energy part of the thermal spectrum @xcite . 
 they are obtained by running a trial - and - error simulation of the observed light curves and spectra that starts at the fireshell transparency . * 
 a more detailed analysis of pair cration process around a kerr - newman bh has led to the concept of dyadotorus @xcite . there , the axially symmetric configuration with a specific distribution of the @xmath2 , as well as its electromagnetic field , have been presented as function of the polar angle . 
 the total spectrum at the transparency of the @xmath2plasma is a convolution of thermal spectra at different angles . 
 this formalism describing the evolution of a baryon - loaded pair plasma is describable in terms of only three intrinsic parameters : the @xmath2 plasma energy @xmath59 , the baryon load @xmath55 , and the specific angular momentum @xmath60 of the incipient newly - formed bh . 
 it is , therefore , independent of the way the pair plasma is created . 
 in addition to the specific case , developed for the sake of example , of the dyadotorus created by a vacuum polarization process in an already formed kerr - newman bh , more possibilities have been envisaged in the meantime :    * the concept of dyadotorus can be applied as well in the case of a pair plasma created via the @xmath61 mechanism in a ns merger as described in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , assuming that the created pair plasma is optically thick . 
 the relative role of neutrino and weak interactions vs. the electromagnetic interactions in building the dyadotorus is currently topic of intense research . * equally important are the relativistic magneto - hydrodynamical process leading to a dyadotorus , indicated in the general treatment of @xcite , and leading to the birth of a kerr - newman bh , surrounded by an opposite charged magnetosphere in a system endowed with global charge neutrality . 
 active research is ongoing . 
 * progress in understanding the ns equilibrium configuration imposing the global charge neutrality condition , as opposed to the local charge neutrality usually assumed @xcite . 
 a critical mass for a non - rotating ns @xmath62 has been found for the nl3 nuclear equation of state @xcite . 
 the effects of rotation and of the nuclear equation of state on the critical mass is presented in @xcite and in @xcite . 
 the existence of electromagnetic fields close to the critical value has been evidenced in the interface between the core and the crust in the above global neutrality model , as well as very different density distributions in the crust and in the core , which could play an important role during the ns 
 ns mergers ( see figure  [ nanda ] and * ? ? ? 
 ( _ middle panel _ ) in the core - crust transition layer normalized to the @xmath63-meson compton wavelength @xmath64  fm . _ 
 lower panel _ : density profile inside a ns star with central density @xmath65 , where @xmath66 is the nuclear density , from the solution of the tov equations ( locally neutral case ) and the globally neutral solution presented in @xcite .

 the above three possibilities have been developed in recent years , but they do not have to be considered exaustive for the formation of a dyadotorus endowed by the above three parameters 
 .    in conclusion the evolution in the understanding of the grb phenomenon , occurring under very different initial conditions , has evidenced the possibility of using the dyadotorus concept for describing sources of an optically thick baryon - loaded @xmath2 plasma within the fireshell treatment in total generality . 
 the key role neutrino emission in the hypercritical accretion process onto a ns has been already examined in the literature ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? 
 the problem of hypercritical accretion in a binary system composed of a co@xmath19 and a companion ns has been studied in @xcite ( see also references therein ) . the energy released during the process , in form of neutrinos and photons , 
 is given by the gain of gravitational potential energy of the matter being accreted by the ns and depends also on the change of binding energy of the ns while accreting both matter and on the angular momentum carried by the accreting material ( see , e.g. , @xcite and @xcite ) . for a typical ns mass of @xmath70  m@xmath71 , a value observed in galactic ns binaries , and a ns critical mass @xmath72 in the range from @xmath73  m@xmath71 up to @xmath74 depending on the equations of state and angular momentum ( see * ? ? ? 
 * ; * ? ? ? 
 * ; * ? ? ? 
 * for details ) , the accretion luminosity can be as high as @xmath75@xmath76  erg  s@xmath42 for accretion rates @xmath77@xmath78  s@xmath42 ( see * ? ? ? 
 * ; * ? ? ? 
 * for details ) . for binary systems with a separation @xmath79  cm ( @xmath80  min ) , 
 our numerical simulations indicate that : a ) the accretion process duration lasts @xmath81  s ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ? 
 * ; * ? ? ? 
 * ) , b ) the ns collapses to a bh , and c ) a total energy larger than @xmath69  erg is released during the hypercritical accretion process . 
 these systems correspond to the bdhne @xcite . for systems with larger separations 
 the hypercritical accretion is not sufficient to induce the collapse of the ns into a bh and the value of @xmath69  erg represents a theoretical estimate of the upper limit to the energy emitted by norm in the hypercritical accretion process . 
 this sub - class of sources corresponds to the xrfs @xcite .    the same energetic considerations do apply in the analysis of the hypercritical accretion occurring in a close binary ns system undergoing merging @xcite . 
 therefore , in total generality , we can conclude that the energy emitted during a ns 
 ns merger leading to the formation of a bh should be larger than @xmath69  erg ( see figure [ rt_gw ] ) . 
 the limit of @xmath69  erg clearly depends on the initial ns mass undergoing accretion , by norm assumed to be @xmath70  m@xmath71 , and on the yet unknown value of @xmath72 , for which only an absolute upper limit of @xmath82  m@xmath71 has been established for the non - rotating case @xcite . as already pointed out in @xcite , for ns 
 ns mergers , the direct determination of the energy threshold of @xmath69  erg dividing s - grfs and s - grbs , as well as xrfs and bdhne , provides fundamental informations for the determination of the actual value of @xmath83 , for the minimum mass of the newly - born bh , and for the mass of the accreting ns .    ] ) . 
 the binary orbit gradually shrinks due to energy loss through gravitational waves emission ( yellow - brown ) . at point 
 a , the merger occurs : the fireshell ( in red ) is created and starts its expansion . 
 it reaches transparency at point b , emitting the p - grb ( light purple ) . the prompt emission ( deep purple ) 
 then follows at point c. the dashed lines represent the gev emission ( delayed relative to the start of the grb ) originating in the newly - born bh . 
 this space - time diagram well illustrates how the gev emission originates in the newly - born bh and follows a different space - time path from the prompt emission , contrary to what stated in @xcite . 
 the prompt emission originates from the interactions of the baryons , accelerated to ultrarelativistic lorentz factors during the pair - baryon electromagnetic pulse , with the clumpy circumburst medium ( see section 2 ) . 
 the analysis of the spiky structure of the prompt emission allows to infer the structure of the circumburst medium ( see figure  [ 090510simlc ] ) . 
 there is the distinct possibility that the gev emission prior to @xmath84 s in the arrival time may interact with the prompt emission . in this sense 
 the work by @xcite may become of interest . ] 
 in this section , we summarize the observations of grb 090510 as well as the data analysis . we used _ 
 ( gbm and lat ) and _ swift_/xrt data for the purposes of this work .      the _ fermi_/gbm instrument @xcite was triggered at @xmath8500:22:59.97 ut on may 10 , 2009 by the short and bright burst grb 090510 ( @xcite , trigger 263607781 / 090510016 ) . 
 the trigger was set off by a precursor emission of duration 30 ms , followed @xmath86 0.4 s later by a hard episode lasting @xmath87 s. this grb was also detected by swift @xcite , _ 
 fermi_/lat @xcite , agile @xcite , konus - wind @xcite , and suzaku - wam @xcite . 
 the position given by the gbm is consistent with that deduced from _ 
 swift _ and lat observations .    during the first second after lat trigger at 00:23:01.22 ut , _ 
 fermi_/lat detected over 50 events ( respectively over 10 ) with an energy above 100 mev ( respectively above 1 gev ) up to the gev range , and more than 150 ( respectively more than 20 ) within the first minute @xcite . 
 this makes grb 090510 the first bright short grb with an emission detected from the kev to the gev range . 
 observations of the host galaxy of grb 090510 , located by vlt / fors2 , provided a measurement of spectral emission lines . 
 this led to the determination of a redshift @xmath88 @xcite . 
 the refined position of grb 090510 obtained from the nordic optical telescope @xcite is offset by 0.7 "" relative to the center of the host galaxy in the vlt / fors2 image . at @xmath89 , 
 this corresponds to a projected distance of 5.5 kpc . 
 the identified host galaxy is a late - type galaxy of stellar mass @xmath90 , with a rather low star - forming rate sfr @xmath91 ( @xcite and references therein ) .      .

 lower panel : comptonized + power law best fit of the corresponding spectrum ( from @xmath92 to @xmath93 s).,title=""fig : "" ]    [ cols=""<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^"",options=""header "" , ]     in order to determine the profile of the cbm , a simulation of the prompt emission following the p - grb has been performed . 
 the simulation starts at the transparency of the fireshell with the parameters that we determined above . 
 a trial - and - error procedure is undertaken , guided by the necessity to fit the light curve of grb 090510 . 
 the results of this simulation ( reproduction of the light curve and spectrum , in the time interval from @xmath94 to @xmath95 s , and cbm profile ) are shown in figure [ 090510simlc ] . 
 the average cbm density is found to be @xmath96 . 
 this low value , typical of galactic halo environments , is consistent with the large offset from the center of the host and further justifies the interpretation of grb 090510 as a short grb originating in a binary ns merger . 
 our theoretical fit of the prompt emission ( see red line in the middle plot of figure [ 090510simlc ] ) predicts a cut - off at @xmath97 mev . 
 the spectrum at energy @xmath98 mev could be affected by the onset of the high energy power - law component manifested both in the data of the mini - calorimeter on board agile ( see top panel of figure 4 in @xcite ) and in the data points from the _ 
 fermi_-gbm bgo - b1 detector . 
 there is a weak precursor emission about 0.4 s before the p - grb ( or @xmath99 s in the cosmological rest frame ) . 
 two gev photons have been detected during the precursor emission . 
 precursors are commonly seen in long bursts : @xcite found that @xmath100 20% of them show evidence of an emission preceding the main emission by tens of seconds . 
 short bursts are less frequently associated with precursors . 
 no significant emission from the grb itself is expected prior to the p - grb  since it marks the transparency of the fireshell  but the precursor may be explainable in the context of a binary ns merger by invoking the effects of the interaction between the two nss just prior to merger . indeed 
 , it has been suggested that precursor emission in short bursts may be caused by resonant fragmentation of the crusts @xcite or by the interaction of the ns magnetospheres @xcite . 
 the timescale ( @xmath100 0.21 s between the precursor and the p - grb ) is consistent with a pre - merger origin of the precursor emission . from its formation to its transparency , the fireshell undergoes a swift evolution . 
 the thermalization of the pair plasma is achieved almost instantaneously ( @xmath101 s , @xcite ) ; and the @xmath102 plasma of grb 090510 reaches the ultra - relativistic regime ( i.e.  a lorentz factor @xmath103 ) in a matter of @xmath104 s , according to the numerical simulation . 
 the radius of the fireshell at transparency , @xmath105 cm , corresponds to more than a hundred light - seconds ; however relativistic motion in the direction of the observer squeezes the light curve by a factor @xmath106 , which makes the fireshell capable of traveling that distance under the observed timescale . 
 the spectral analysis of this precursor is limited by the low number of counts . 
 @xcite interpreted the spectrum with a blackbody plus power law model . 
 this leads to a blackbody temperature of @xmath107 kev . 
 the isotropic energy contained in the precursor amounts to @xmath108 erg . 
 an interesting feature of the fireshell model is the possibility to infer a theoretical redshift from the observations of the p - grb and the prompt emission . in the case of grb 090510 , 
 a comparison is therefore possible between the measured redshift @xmath88 and its theoretical derivation . 
 an agreement between the two values would in particular strengthen the validity of our p - grb choice , which would in turn strengthen our results obtained with this p - grb . 
 the feature of redshift estimate stems from the relations , engraved in the fireshell theory , between different quantities computed at the transparency point : the radius in the laboratory frame , the co - moving frame and blue - shifted temperatures of the plasma , the lorentz factor , and the fraction of energy radiated in the p - grb and in the prompt emission as functions of @xmath55 ( see figure 4 in @xcite ) . 
 thus , the ratio @xmath109 implies a finite range for the coupled parameters @xmath43 and @xmath55 ( last panel of figure 4 in @xcite ) . 
 assuming @xmath110 , this ratio is known since it is equal to the ratio between the observed fluences of the respective quantities : @xmath111    with the measured values @xmath112 erg @xmath113 and @xmath114 erg @xmath113 , we find @xmath115 . 
 in addition , knowing the couple [ @xmath116 , @xmath55 ] gives the ( blue - shifted towards the observer ) temperature of the fireshell at transparency @xmath118 ( figure 4 in @xcite , second panel ) . 
 but we also have the following relation between @xmath118 and the observed temperature at transparency @xmath119 , linking their ratio to the redshift : @xmath120    finally , since we assume that @xmath110 , we also have an expression of @xmath43 as a function of @xmath121 using the formula of the k - corrected isotropic energy : @xmath122    where @xmath123 is the photon spectrum of the grb and the fluence @xmath124 is obtained in the full gbm energy range 8  40000 kev . 
 the use of all these relations allows a redshift to be determined by an iterative procedure , testing at every step the value of the parameters @xmath125 and @xmath118 . 
 the procedure successfully ends when both values are consistent according to the relations described above . in the case of grb 090510 
 , we find @xmath126 , which provides a satisfactory agreement with the measured value @xmath88 . 
 grb 090510 is associated with a high - energy emission , consistently with all other observed s - grbs , i.e. energetic events with @xmath21 erg . 
 the only case of a s - grb without gev emission , namely grb 090227b , has been explained by the absence of alignment between the lat and the source at the time of the grb emission . 
 nevertheless evidence of some gev emission in this source has been recently obtained ( ruffini et al . 
 , in preparation ) . 
 the gev light curve of grb 090510 is plotted in figure [ 090510gev ] together with other s - grb light curves and showing a common power - law behavior , which goes as @xmath127 , similar to the clustering of the gev light curves found by @xcite . 
 these s - grbs are compared with that of the bdhne 130427a which shares a similar behavior . @xcite 
 suggest and argue that the gev emission is related to the presence of a bh and its activity . 
 this view is supported by the fact that the gev emission is delayed with respect to the @xmath38-ray emission : it starts only after the p - grb is over . 
 the gev emission of grb 090510 is particularly intense , reaching @xmath128 erg . 
 such a large value , one of the largest observed among s - grbs , is consistent with the large angular momentum of the newborn bh . 
 this energetic can not be explained in terms of nss in view of the lower value of the gravitational binding energy . 
 the absence of gev emission in s - grfs is also confirmed from the strong upper limit to the gev emission for s - grbs imposed by the fermi - lat sensitivity . 
 we assume for a moment that the gev emission of a s - grf is similar to that of s - grb . 
 we then compute the observed gev flux light curve of s - grb 090510 at different redshifts , e.g. , @xmath129 and @xmath130 , which correspond to the redshifts of the s - grb 081024b and of the s - grb 140402a , respectively ( aimuratov et al . 
 , in preparation ) . 
 the result is that if we compare these computed flux light curves with the _ 
 fermi_-lat sensitivity of the pass 8 release 2 version 6 instrument response functions , which is approximately @xmath131 erg @xmath113s@xmath42 , all of them are always well above the lat broadband sensitivity by a factor @xmath132 ( see figure [ gevz ] ) . 
 this result does not depend on the choice of the source . in their rest - frame all the s - grb gev light curves follow a similar behavior . therefore , the gev emission of s - grb 090510 is always above @xmath132 times to the lat sensitivity , even at higher redshifts . 
 if we now assume that s - grfs do conform to the same behavior of s - grbs , the absence of detection of gev emission implies that the s - grfs have necessarily fluxes at least @xmath133@xmath134 times smaller than those of s - grbs . 
 @xmath7 gev flux light curve of the s - grbs 090510 ( red squares ) , and the corresponding ones obtained by translating this s - grb at @xmath129 ( blue circles ) and at @xmath135 ( green diamonds ) . ]      in order to estimate the energy requirement of the @xmath6@xmath7 gev emission of figure [ 090510gev ] we consider the accretion of mass @xmath136 onto a kerr - newman bh , dominated by its angular momentum and endowed with electromagnetic fields not influencing the geometry , which remains approximately that of a kerr bh . 
 we recall that if the infalling accreted material is in an orbit co - rotating with the bh spin , up to @xmath137 of the initial mass is converted into radiation , for a maximally rotating kerr bh , while this efficiency drops to @xmath138 , when the infalling material is on a counter - rotating orbit ( see ruffini & wheeler 1969 , in problem 2 of @xmath139 104 in @xcite ) . 
 therefore , the gev emission can be expressed as @xmath140 and depends not only on the efficiency @xmath141 in the accretion process of matter @xmath136 , but also on the geometry of the emission described by the beaming factor @xmath142 ( here @xmath143 is the half opening angle of jet - like emission ) . 
 depending on the assumptions we introduce in equation [ accretion ] , we can give constraints on the amount of accreted matter or on the geometry of the system . 
 for an isotropic emission , @xmath144 , the accretion of @xmath145  m@xmath71 , for the co - rotating case , and of @xmath146  m@xmath71 , for the counter - rotating case , is required . 
 alternatively , we can assume that the accreted matter comes from the crustal material from an @xmath147  m@xmath71 ns 
 ns binary progenitor . 
 the crustal mass from the nl3 nuclear model for each of these nss is @xmath148  m@xmath71 ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ? 
 * and figure [ nanda ] ) . 
 assuming that crustal material accounts also for the baryon load mass , e.g. , @xmath149 m@xmath71 , the total available mass for accretion is @xmath150 m@xmath71 . 
 then , the presence of a beaming is necessary : from equation [ accretion ] , a half opening beaming angle @xmath151 , for co - rotating case , and @xmath152 , for the counter - rotating case , would be required . 
 the above considerations are clearly independent from the relativistic beaming angle @xmath153 , where the lower limit on the lorentz factor @xmath154 has been derived , in a different context , by @xcite to the gev luminosity light curve ( see figure [ 090510gev ] ) . 
 further consequences on these results for the estimate of the rate of these s - grbs will be presented elsewhere ( ruffini et al . in preparation ) . 
 it is interesting to recall some of the main novelties introduced in this paper with respect to previous works on grb 090510 . particularly noteworthy 
 are the differences from the previous review of short bursts by @xcite , made possible by the discovery of the high energy emission by the fermi team in this specific source @xcite . 
 a new family of short bursts characterized by the presence of a bh and associated high energy emission when lat data are now available , comprehends grbs 081024b , 090227b , 090510 , 140402a , and 140619b ( see , e.g. , figure [ 090510gev ] ) . 
 the excellent data obtained by the fermi team and interpreted within the fireshell model has allowed to relate in this paper the starting point of the high energy emission with the birth of a bh . 
 our fireshell analysis assumes that the @xmath38-ray and the gev components originate from different physical processes . 
 first , the interpretation of the prompt emission differs from the standard synchrotron model : we model the collisions of the baryon accelerated by the grb outflow with the ambient medium following a fully relativistic approach ( see section 2 ) . 
 second , we assume that the gev emission originates from the matter accretion onto the newly - born bh and we show that indeed the energy requirement is fulfilled 
 . this approach explains also the delayed onset of the gev emission , i.e. , it is observable only after the transparency condition , namely after the p - grb emission . 
 the joint utilization of the excellent data from the _ 
 fermi_-gbm nai - n6 and n7 and the bgo - b1 detectors and from the mini - calorimeter on board agile @xcite has given strong observational support to our theoretical work . 
 grb 090510 has been analyzed in light of the recent progress achieved in the fireshell theory and the resulting new classification of grbs . 
 we show that grb 090510 is a s - grb , originating in a binary ns merger ( see figure  [ rt_gw ] ) . 
 such systems , by the absence of the associated sn events , are by far the simplest grbs to be analyzed . 
 our analysis indicates the presence of three distinct episodes in s - grbs : the p - grb , the prompt emission , and the gev emission . by following the precise identification of successive events predicted by the fireshell theory , we evidence for the first indication of a kerr bh or , possibly , a kerr - newman bh formation :    * the p - grb spectrum of grb 090510 , in the time interval from @xmath92 to @xmath94 s , is best - fitted by a comptonized component ( see figures  [ pgrb ] and [ comp ] and table  [ tab : fit ] ) , which is interpreted as a convolution of thermal spectra originating in a dyadotorus ( see @xcite and @xcite , figure  [ dyadotorus ] , and section 2 ) . * 
 the prompt emission follows at the end of the p - grb ( see figure  [ spectotal ] ) . 
 the analysis of the prompt emission within the fireshell model allows to determine the inhomogeneities in the cbm giving rise to the spiky structure of the prompt emission and to estimate as well an averaged cbm density of @xmath155  @xmath18 obtained from a few cbm clouds of mass @xmath48 g and typical dimensions of @xmath53 cm ( see figure  [ 090510simlc ] ) . 
 such a density is typical of galactic halos where binary ns are expected to migrate due to large natal kicks . * the late x - ray emission of grb 090510 
 does not follow the characteristic patterns expected in bdhn events ( see figure  [ episode3 ] and @xcite ) . * 
 the gev emission occurs at the end of the p - grb emission and is initially concurrent with the prompt emission . 
 this sequence occurs in both s - grbs @xcite and bdhne @xcite . 
 this delayed long lasting ( @xmath156 s ) gev emission in grb 090510 is one of the most intense ever observed in any grb ( see figure  [ 090510gev ] and * ? ? ? 
 * ; * ? ? ? 
 * we then consider accretion on co - rotating and counter - rotating orbits ( see ruffini & wheeler 1969 , in problem 2 of @xmath139 104 in @xcite ) around an extreme kerr bh . assuming the accretion of the crustal mass @xmath157  m@xmath71 from a @xmath147  m@xmath71 ns 
 ns binary , fulfilling global charge neutrality ( see figure  [ nanda ] ) , geometrical beaming angles of @xmath152 , for co - rotating case , and @xmath151 , for the counter - rotating case , are inferred . in order to fulfill the transparency condition , 
 the initial lorentz factor of the jetted material has to be @xmath158 ( see section 6.6 ) . 
 * while there is evidence that the gev emission must be jetted , no beaming appears to be present in the p - grb and in the prompt emission , with important consequence for the estimate of the rate of such events @xcite . 
 * the energetic and the possible beaming of the gev emission requires the presence of a kerr bh , or a kerr - newman bh dominated by its angular momentum and with electromagnetic fields not influencing the geometry ( see also section 6.5 ) . * 
 the self - consistency of the entire procedure has been verified by estimating , on the ground of the fireshell theory , the cosmological redshift of the source . 
 the theoretical redshift is @xmath159 ( see section  6.4 ) , close to and consistent with the spectroscopically measured value @xmath10 @xcite . * 
 the values of @xmath160 and @xmath161 of grb 090510 fulfill with excellent agreement the muruwazha relation ( see section  5.2 , figure  [ calderone ] and * ? ? ? 
 the main result of this article is that the dyadotorus manifests itself by the p - grb emission and clearly preceeds the prompt emission phase , as well as the gev emission originating from the newly - formed bh . 
 this contrasts with the usual assumption made in almost the totality of works relating bhs and grbs in which the bh preceeds the grb emission . in conclusion , in this article 
 , we take grb 090510 as the prototype of s - grbs and perform a new time - resoved spectral analysis , in excellent agreement with that performed by the agile and the _ fermi _ teams . now 
 this analysis , guided by a theoretical approach successfully tested in this new family of s - grbs , is directed to identify a precise sequence of different events made possible by the exceptional quality of the data of grb 090510 . 
 this include a new structure in the thermal emission of the p - grb emission , followed by the onset of the gev emission linked to the bh formation , allowing , as well , to derive the strucutre of the circumburst medium from the spiky structure of the prompt emission . 
 this sequence , for the first time , illustrates the formation process of a bh . 
 it is expected that this very unique condition of generating a jetted gev emission in such a well defined scenario of a newly - born bh will possibly lead to a deeper understanding of the equally jetted gev emission observed , but not yet explained , in a variety of systems harboring a kerr bh . among these systems we recall binary x - ray sources ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ? * and references therein ) , microquasars ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ? * and references therein ) , as well as , at larger scale , active galactic nuclei .

 we are indebted to marco tavani for very interesting comments , as well as for giving us observational supporting evidences .

 the hardest , with @xmath1  erg , coalesce to form a black hole ( bh ) and are indicated as genuine short - grbs ( s - grbs ) . within the fireshell model , s - grbs exhibit three different components : the p - grb emission , observed at the transparency of a self - accelerating baryon-@xmath2 plasma ; the prompt emission , originating from the interaction of the accelerated baryons with the circumburst medium ; the high - energy ( gev ) emission , observed after the p - grb and indicating the formation of a bh . 
 grb 090510 gives the first evidence for the formation of a kerr bh or , possibly , a kerr - newman bh . 
 its p - grb spectrum can be fitted by a convolution of thermal spectra whose origin can be traced back to an axially symmetric dyadotorus . 
 a large value of the angular momentum of the newborn bh is consistent with the large energetics of this s - grb , which reach in the @xmath3@xmath4  kev range @xmath5  erg and in the @xmath6@xmath7  gev range @xmath8  erg , the most energetic gev emission ever observed in s - grbs . 
 the theoretical redshift @xmath9 that we derive from the fireshell theory is consistent with the spectroscopic measurement @xmath10 , showing the self - consistency of the theoretical approach . 
 all s - grbs exhibit gev emission , when inside the _ fermi_-lat field of view , unlike s - grfs , which never evidence it . 
 the gev emission appears to be the discriminant for the formation of a bh in grbs , confirmed by their observed overall energetics .",arxiv
"a choice of nonconstant meromorphic function @xmath28 on a compact riemann surface @xmath0 realizes @xmath0 as a finite sheeted branched covering of the riemann sphere @xmath29 . 
 _ log - riemann surfaces of finite type _ 
 are certain branched coverings , in a generalized sense , of @xmath30 by a punctured compact riemann surface , namely , which are given by certain transcendental functions of infinite degree . 
 formally a log - riemann surface consists of a riemann surface together with a local holomorphic diffeomorphism @xmath31 from the surface to @xmath30 such that the set of points @xmath19 added to the surface , in the completion @xmath18 with respect to the path - metric induced by the flat metric @xmath32 , is discrete . 
 log - riemann surfaces were defined and studied in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) , where it was shown that the map @xmath31 restricted to any small enough punctured metric neighbourhood of a point @xmath33 in @xmath19 gives a covering of a punctured disc in @xmath30 , and is thus equivalent to either @xmath34 restricted to a punctured disc @xmath35 ( in which case we say @xmath33 is a ramification point of order @xmath1 ) or to @xmath36 restricted to a half - plane @xmath37 ( in which case we say @xmath33 is a ramification point of infinite order ) .    a log - riemann surface is said to be of finite type if it has finitely many ramification points and finitely generated fundamental group . 
 we will only consider those for which the set of infinite order ramification points is nonempty ( otherwise the map @xmath31 has finite degree and is given by a meromorphic function on a compact riemann surface ) . in @xcite , @xcite , 
 uniformization theorems were proved for log - riemann surfaces of finite type , which imply that a log - riemann surface of finite type is given by a pair @xmath38 , where @xmath0 is a compact riemann surface , and @xmath31 is a meromorphic function on the punctured surface @xmath16 such that the differential @xmath39 has essential singularities at the punctures of a specific type , namely _ 
 exponential singularities_.    given a germ of meromorphic function @xmath40 at a point @xmath41 of a riemann surface , a function @xmath42 with an isolated singularity at @xmath41 is said to have an exponential singularity of type @xmath40 at @xmath41 if locally @xmath43 for some germ of meromorphic function @xmath13 at @xmath41 , while a 1-form @xmath44 is said to have an exponential singularity of type @xmath40 at @xmath41 if locally @xmath45 for some germ of meromorphic 1-form @xmath46 at @xmath41 . 
 note that the spaces of germs of functions and 1-forms with exponential singularity of type @xmath40 at @xmath41 only depend on the equivalence class @xmath47 $ ] in the space @xmath48 of germs of meromorphic functions at @xmath41 modulo germs of holomorphic functions at @xmath41 . 
 thus the uniformization theorems of @xcite , @xcite give us @xmath1 germs of meromorphic functions @xmath49 at the punctures @xmath50 , with poles of orders @xmath3 say , such that near a puncture @xmath51 the map @xmath31 is of the form @xmath52 , where @xmath53 is a germ of meromorphic function near @xmath51 and @xmath28 a local coordinate near @xmath51 . 
 the punctures correspond to ends of the log - riemann surface , where at each puncture @xmath51 , @xmath54 infinite order ramification points are added in the metric completion , so that the total number of infinite order ramification points is @xmath55 . 
 the @xmath54 infinite order ramification points added at a puncture @xmath51 correspond to the @xmath54 directions of approach to the puncture along which @xmath56 so that @xmath57 decays exponentially and @xmath58 converges . in the case of genus zero with one puncture for example , which is considered in @xcite , @xmath31 must have the form @xmath59 where @xmath60 is a rational function and @xmath61 is a polynomial of degree equal to the number of infinite order ramification points .    in @xcite , certain spaces of functions and @xmath6-forms on a log - riemann surface @xmath62 of finite type were defined , giving rise to a derham cohomology group @xmath63 . 
 the integrals of the @xmath6-forms considered along curves in @xmath62 joining the infinite ramification points converge , giving rise to a pairing between @xmath63 and @xmath21 , which was shown to be nondegenerate ( @xcite ) . 
 the spaces of functions and @xmath6-forms defined were observed to depend only on the types @xmath49 of the exponential singularities , and so a notion less rigid than that of a log - riemann surface was defined , namely the notion of an _ exp - algebraic curve _ , which consists of a compact riemann surface @xmath0 together with @xmath1 equivalence classes of germs of meromorphic functions modulo germs of holomorphic functions , @xmath2 , \cdots , [ h_n ] \}$ ] , with poles of orders @xmath3 at points @xmath4 . 
 the relevant spaces of functions and @xmath6-forms with exponential singularities at @xmath4 of types @xmath9 , \cdots , [ h_n]$ ] can then be defined as follows : @xmath64 , \cdots , [ h_n ] \ } \\ { { \mathcal o}}_{{{\mathcal h } } } : = & \ { f \in { { \mathcal m}}_{{{\mathcal h } } } \,\mid\ , f \hbox { holomorphic on } s ' \ } \\ \omega_{{{\mathcal h } } }   : = & \ { \omega \,\mid\ , \omega \hbox { meromorphic 1-form on } s ' \hbox { with exponential singularities}\\ & \hbox {    of types } [ h_1 ] , \cdots , [ h_n ] \ } \\ \omega^0_{{{\mathcal h } } } : = & \ { \omega \in \omega_{{{\mathcal h } } } \,\mid\ , \omega \hbox { holomorphic on } s ' \}.\end{aligned}\ ] ]    for @xmath65 ( respectively , @xmath66 ) we can define a divisor @xmath67 ( respectively , @xmath68 ) by @xmath69 if @xmath70 and @xmath71 if @xmath72 , where @xmath13 is a germ of meromorphic function at @xmath10 such that @xmath12 ( respectively , @xmath73 if @xmath70 and @xmath74 if @xmath72 , where @xmath46 is a germ of meromorphic @xmath6-form at @xmath10 such that @xmath15 ) .    in @xcite it is shown how to naturally associate to an exp - algebraic curve @xmath75 a degree zero line bundle @xmath76 together with a meromorphic connection @xmath77 with poles at @xmath4 . 
 the connection @xmath6-form of @xmath78 near @xmath10 is given ( with respect to an appropriate local trivialization ) by @xmath79 , so that the pair @xmath80 determines the exp - algebraic curve @xmath81 . 
 there are naturally defined isomorphisms between the space of meromorphic sections of @xmath23 ( respectively , the space of meromorphic @xmath23-valued @xmath6-forms ) and @xmath82 ( respectively , @xmath83 ) , such that a meromorphic section @xmath84 of @xmath23 ( respectively , a meromorphic @xmath23-valued @xmath6-form @xmath46 ) maps to an @xmath65 with the same divisor as @xmath84 ( respectively , an @xmath66 with the same divisor as @xmath46 ) .    in particular the space @xmath24 of meromorphic @xmath23-valued @xmath6-forms which are holomorphic on @xmath16 is naturally isomorphic to the space @xmath7 . 
 fixing an @xmath11 inducing a log - riemann surface structure on @xmath0 , with completion @xmath18 , the @xmath6-forms in @xmath7 can be integrated along curves in @xmath21 , giving a map @xmath85 let @xmath25 denote the image of @xmath21 in @xmath86 . 
 then our torelli - type theorem for exp - algebraic curves states that the pair @xmath87 determines the exp - algebraic curve @xmath88 :    [ mainthm ] let @xmath89 be two exp - algebraic curves with the same underlying riemann surface @xmath0 , and the same set of punctures @xmath4 . 
 suppose that @xmath90 is nontrivial , that the line bundles @xmath91 are isomorphic and that the induced isomorphism @xmath92 maps @xmath93 to @xmath94 
 . then @xmath95 . 
 finally , we mention briefly some appearances of functions with exponential singularities in the literature . 
 certain functions with exponential singularities , namely the @xmath1-point _ baker - akhiezer functions _ ( @xcite , @xcite ) , have been used in the algebro - geometric integration of integrable systems ( see , for example , @xcite , @xcite and the surveys @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) . 
 given a divisor @xmath96 on @xmath16 , an @xmath1-point baker - akhiezer function ( with respect to the data @xmath97 ) is a function @xmath42 in the space @xmath98 satisfying the additional properties that the divisor @xmath99 of zeroes and poles of @xmath42 on @xmath16 satisfies @xmath100 , and that @xmath101 is holomorphic at @xmath51 for all @xmath102 . 
 for @xmath96 a non - special divisor of degree at least @xmath13 , the space of such baker - akhiezer functions is known to have dimension @xmath103 . 
 functions and differentials with exponential singularities on compact riemann surfaces have also been studied by cutillas ripoll ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , where they arise naturally in the solution of the _ weierstrass problem _ of realizing arbitrary divisors on compact riemann surfaces , and by taniguchi ( @xcite , @xcite ) , where entire functions satisfying certain topological conditions ( called  structural finiteness "" ) are shown to be precisely those entire functions whose derivatives have an exponential singularity at @xmath104 , namely functions of the form @xmath105 , where @xmath106 are polynomials .

 * this work grew out of a visit of the second author to tifr , mumbai . 
 he would like to thank tifr for its hospitality . 
 we recall some basic definitions and facts from @xcite , @xcite , @xcite . 
 a log - riemann surface is a pair @xmath107 , where @xmath0 is a riemann surface and @xmath108 is a local holomorphic diffeomorphism such that the set of points @xmath19 added to @xmath0 in the completion @xmath109 with respect to the path metric induced by the flat metric @xmath32 is discrete . 
 the map @xmath31 extends to the metric completion @xmath62 as a @xmath6-lipschitz map . in @xcite 
 it is shown that the map @xmath31 restricted to a sufficiently small punctured metric neighbourhood @xmath110 of a ramification point is a covering of a punctured disc @xmath111 in @xmath30 , and so has a well - defined degree @xmath112 , called the order of the ramification point ( we assume that the order is always at least @xmath113 , since order one points can always be added to @xmath0 and @xmath31 extended to these points in order to obtain a log - riemann surface ) . 
 a log - riemann surface is of finite type if it has finitely many ramification points and finitely generated fundamental group . 
 for example , the log - riemann surface given by @xmath114 is of finite type ( with the metric @xmath32 it is isometric to the riemann surface of the logarithm , which is simply connected , with a single ramification point of infinite order ) , as is the log - riemann surface given by the gaussian integral @xmath115 , which has two ramification points , both of infinite order , as in the figure below :    log - riemann surface of the gaussian integral    in @xcite , it is shown that a log - riemann surface of finite type ( which has at least one infinite order ramification point ) is of the form @xmath116 , where @xmath16 is a punctured compact riemann surface @xmath8 and @xmath31 is meromorphic on @xmath16 and @xmath39 has exponential singularities at the punctures @xmath4 . 
 let @xmath49 be the types of the exponential singularities of @xmath39 at the punctures @xmath4 . 
 as described in @xcite , each puncture @xmath51 corresponds to an end of the log - riemann surface where @xmath54 infinite order ramification points are added , @xmath54 being the order of the pole of @xmath117 at @xmath51 . 
 let @xmath33 be an infinite order ramification point associated to a puncture @xmath51 . 
 an @xmath118-ball @xmath119 around @xmath33 is isometric to the @xmath118-ball around the infinite order ramification point of the riemann surface of the logarithm ( given by cutting and pasting infinitely many discs together ) , and there is an argument function @xmath120 defined on the punctured ball @xmath121 . 
 while the function @xmath31 , which is of the form @xmath122 in a punctured neighbourhood of @xmath51 for some meromorphic @xmath6-form @xmath123 , extends continuously to @xmath33 for the metric topology on @xmath62 , in general functions of the form @xmath124 ( where @xmath46 is a @xmath6-form meromorphic near @xmath51 ) do * not * extend continuously to @xmath33 for the metric topology ( @xcite ) . 
 limits of these functions in sectors @xmath125 do exist however and are independent of the sector ; we say that the function is _ stolz continuous _ at points of @xmath19 . 
 define spaces of functions and @xmath6-forms on @xmath62 : @xmath126    we remark that these are simply the spaces @xmath127 defined in the introduction , where @xmath2 , \cdots , [ h_n ] \}$ ] . 
 functions in @xmath98 are stolz continuous at points of @xmath19 taking the value @xmath128 there . 
 the integrals of @xmath6-forms @xmath44 in @xmath129 over curves 
 @xmath130 \to s^*$ ] joining points @xmath131 of @xmath19 converge if @xmath132 is disjoint from the poles of @xmath44 and tends to these points through sectors @xmath133 ( since any primitive of @xmath44 on a sector is stolz continuous ) . 
 the definitions of the above spaces only depend on the types @xmath134 \in { { \mathcal m}}_{p_i}/{{\mathcal o}}_{p_i } \}$ ] of the exponential singularities of the @xmath6-form @xmath39 , which do not change if @xmath39 is multiplied by a meromorphic function . 
 it is natural to define then a structure less rigid than that of a log - riemann surface of finite type .    given a punctured compact riemann surface @xmath8 , two meromorphic functions @xmath135 on @xmath16 inducing log - riemann surface structures of finite type are considered equivalent if @xmath136 is meromorphic on the compact surface @xmath0 . 
 an exp - algebraic curve is an equivalence class of such log - riemann surface structures of finite type . 
 it follows from the uniformization theorem of @xcite that an exp - algebraic curve is given by the data of a punctured compact riemann surface and @xmath1 ( equivalence classes of ) germs of meromorphic functions @xmath137 \in { { \mathcal m}}_{p_i}/{{\mathcal o}}_{p_i } \}$ ] with poles at the punctures . 
 we can associate a topological space @xmath138 to an exp - algebraic curve , given as a set by @xmath139 , where @xmath19 is the set of infinite ramification points added with respect to any map @xmath31 in the equivalence class of log - riemann surfaces of finite type , and the topology is the weakest topology such that all maps @xmath140 in the equivalence class extend continuously to @xmath138 .    finally , for a meromorphic function @xmath42 on @xmath16 ( respectively , 
 meromorphic @xmath6-form @xmath44 on @xmath16 ) with exponential singularities of types @xmath49 at points @xmath4 we can define a divisor @xmath67 ( respectively , @xmath68 ) by @xmath69 if @xmath70 and @xmath71 if @xmath72 , where @xmath13 is a germ of meromorphic function at @xmath10 such that @xmath12 ( respectively , @xmath73 if @xmath70 and @xmath74 if @xmath72 , where @xmath46 is a germ of meromorphic @xmath6-form at @xmath10 such that @xmath15 ) . 
 note that the divisor @xmath99 can also be defined by @xmath141 , so it follows from the residue theorem applied to the meromorphic @xmath6-form @xmath142 that the divisor @xmath99 has degree zero . 
 let @xmath143 be an exp - algebraic curve , where @xmath0 is a compact riemann surface of genus @xmath13 and @xmath49 are germs of meromorphic functions at points @xmath4 . 
 let @xmath144 be the space of holomorphic @xmath6-forms on @xmath0 . 
 the data @xmath145 defines a degree zero line bundle @xmath76 together with a transcendental section @xmath146 of this line bundle which is non - zero on the punctured surface @xmath16 as follows :    solving the mittag - leffler problem locally for the distribution @xmath147 gives meromorphic functions on an open cover such that the differences are holomorphic on intersections , and hence gives an element of @xmath148 . under the exponential 
 this gives a degree zero line bundle as an element of @xmath149 . 
 explicitly this is constructed as follows :    let @xmath150 be pairwise disjoint coordinate disks around the punctures @xmath4 and let @xmath151 be an open subset of @xmath16 intersecting each disk @xmath152 in an annulus @xmath153 around @xmath10 such that @xmath154 is an open cover of @xmath0 . 
 define a line bundle @xmath76 by taking the functions @xmath155 to be the transition functions for the line bundle on the intersections @xmath156 . 
 define a holomorphic non - vanishing section of @xmath76 on @xmath16 by :    @xmath157    define a connection @xmath77 on @xmath76 by declaring that @xmath158 . 
 then for any holomorphic section @xmath84 on @xmath151 , @xmath159 for some holomorphic function @xmath42 , and @xmath160 , so @xmath77 is holomorphic on @xmath151 . on each disk @xmath152 
 , letting @xmath161 be the section which is constant equal to @xmath6 on @xmath152 ( with respect to the trivialization on @xmath152 ) , for any holomorphic section @xmath84 on @xmath152 , @xmath162 for some holomorphic function @xmath42 , and @xmath163 , so @xmath164 thus the connection @xmath6-form of @xmath77 with respect to @xmath161 is given by @xmath79 , so @xmath77 is meromorphic on @xmath152 with a single pole at @xmath10 of order @xmath165 . 
 let @xmath166 be the unique section of the dual bundle @xmath167 on @xmath16 such that @xmath168 on @xmath16 . 
 then for any non - zero meromorphic section @xmath84 of @xmath23 , the function @xmath169 is meromorphic on @xmath16 with exponential singularities at @xmath4 of types @xmath49 , and the divisors of @xmath84 and @xmath42 coincide . 
 thus the line bundle @xmath76 has degree zero . in summary 
 we have :    [ existence ] for any log - riemann surface of finite type @xmath62 , the line bundle @xmath76 has degree zero and the maps @xmath170 ( respectively , @xmath171 ) are mutually inverse isomorphisms between the spaces of meromorphic sections of @xmath23 and @xmath98 ( respectively , the spaces of meromorphic @xmath23-valued @xmath6-forms and @xmath172 ) preserving divisors .    in particular the vector spaces @xmath173 are non - zero . 
 since the isomorphisms above preserve divisors , the spaces @xmath174 correspond to the spaces of meromorphic sections of @xmath23 and meromorphic @xmath23-valued @xmath6-forms which are holomorphic on @xmath16 , both of which are non - empty . 
 the correspondence @xmath175 gives a one - to - one correspondence between exp - algebraic structures on @xmath0 and degree zero line bundles on @xmath0 with meromorphic connections with all poles of order at least two , zero residues , and trivial monodromy . 
 since the connection @xmath6-form of @xmath78 is given by @xmath79 on @xmath152 , all residues of @xmath78 are equal to zero , while the monodromy of @xmath78 is trivial since @xmath176 is a single - valued horizontal section . 
 conversely , given such a meromorphic connection @xmath177 on a degree zero line bundle @xmath178 , if @xmath4 are the poles of @xmath177 and @xmath179 are the connection @xmath6-forms of @xmath177 with respect to trivializations near @xmath4 , then each @xmath180 has zero residue at @xmath10 and pole order at least two , hence there exist meromorphic germs @xmath49 near @xmath4 such that @xmath181 . 
 we obtain an exp - algebraic curve @xmath182 . 
 it is clear for an exp - algebraic curve @xmath26 that @xmath183 , so the correspondences are inverses of each other .    finally we remark that by serre duality , the degree zero line bundle @xmath76 , given as an element of @xmath148 , can also be described as an element of @xmath184 using residues , as the linear functional @xmath185 
 we proceed to the proof of theorem [ mainthm ] 
 . we will need the following theorems from @xcite and @xcite :      [ approxn ] let @xmath0 be a compact riemann surface and @xmath188 a closed subset such that @xmath189 has finitely many connected components @xmath190 , and for each @xmath191 let @xmath192 be a point of @xmath193 . 
 then any continuous function @xmath42 on @xmath194 which is holomorphic in the interior of @xmath194 can be uniformly approximated on @xmath194 by functions meromorphic on @xmath0 with poles only in the set @xmath195 . 
 let @xmath196 be two exp - algebraic curves with the same underlying riemann surface @xmath0 and the same set of punctures @xmath4 , and suppose the hypothesis of theorem 1.1 holds , namely the line bundles @xmath91 are isomorphic and the induced isomorphism @xmath197 maps @xmath93 to @xmath94 . 
 since the spaces @xmath198 are isomorphic to the spaces of meromorphic sections of @xmath199 and @xmath200 respectively , there is an induced isomorphism @xmath201 which preserves divisors . 
 we fix non - zero functions @xmath202 which correspond to each other under this isomorphism , and let @xmath203 denote the completions induced by the corresponding log - riemann surface structures . 
 we also fix a meromorphic @xmath6-form @xmath204 on @xmath0 . 
 then the divisor preserving isomorphisms @xmath201 and @xmath205 induced by the isomorphism @xmath206 can be expressed as @xmath207 respectively , where @xmath13 varies over all meromorphic functions on @xmath0 . 
 the hypothesis of theorem [ mainthm ] implies that for any @xmath212 , there is a @xmath213 such that @xmath214 for all meromorphic functions @xmath13 on @xmath0 such that @xmath215 is holomorphic on @xmath16 for @xmath216 . if @xmath208 is a meromorphic function on @xmath0 such that @xmath217 is holomorphic on @xmath16 , then @xmath218 for some meromorphic function @xmath13 on @xmath0 such that @xmath219 is holomorphic on @xmath16 . since the isomorphism @xmath220 is divisor preserving , we have that @xmath221 is also holomorphic on @xmath16 , so for any @xmath212 there is a @xmath222 such that @xmath223 since this is true for all @xmath212 , it follows from theorem [ pairing ] that @xmath224 , so there exists a meromorphic function @xmath225 on @xmath0 such that @xmath226 is holomorphic on @xmath16 and @xmath227 . 
 in this case there exists a closed curve @xmath132 disjoint from the punctures @xmath4 and the poles and zeroes of @xmath235 such that @xmath236 is connected . fix a non - zero meromorphic function @xmath237 on @xmath0 such that @xmath238 ( and hence also @xmath239 ) is holomorphic on @xmath16 . 
 if the meromorphic @xmath6-form @xmath240 ( which is holomorphic outside the punctures and the zeroes and poles of @xmath235 ) is not identically zero , then we can choose a continuous function @xmath241 on @xmath132 such that @xmath242 ( since the @xmath6-form @xmath243 is holomorphic and not identically zero on @xmath132 ) . 
 by theorem [ approxn ] , since @xmath236 is connected and contains @xmath244 , we can choose a meromorphic function @xmath245 on @xmath0 which is holomorphic on @xmath246 and uniformly close enough to @xmath241 on @xmath132 such that @xmath247 . 
 letting @xmath248 , we have that @xmath217 is holomorphic on @xmath16 and @xmath249 , contradicting lemma [ exact ] . 
 it follows that @xmath250 , from which it follows easily that @xmath95 .      in this case 
 @xmath251 and we may assume @xmath252 . fix a non - zero polynomial @xmath61 such that @xmath253 are holomorphic on @xmath16 
 . then by lemma [ exact ] , for all @xmath254 , taking @xmath255 we have @xmath256 from which it follows that the laurent series of @xmath257 around @xmath258 vanishes identically , hence @xmath259 and @xmath95 . 
 in this case @xmath251 and we may assume the single puncture @xmath260 , and that the functions @xmath235 are of the form @xmath261 for some polynomials @xmath262 . 
 in this case it follows from the main theorem of @xcite that the dimension of @xmath263 equals @xmath264 . 
 since @xmath93 and @xmath94 are isomorphic by hypothesis , it follows that @xmath265 say , where @xmath266 since @xmath267 is non - trivial . 
 let @xmath268 . 
 let @xmath269 be a basis for @xmath267 as described in section 4 of @xcite , each @xmath270 being a curve joining a pair of ramification points @xmath271 , where @xmath272 . by hypothesis , for each curve @xmath273 
 there is a @xmath274 such that @xmath275 for all polynomials @xmath276 . 
 consider the @xmath277 matrix @xmath278 it follows from theorem iii.1.5.1 of @xcite that the @xmath279 @xmath6-forms @xmath280 span @xmath281 , and hence form a basis for @xmath281 . 
 since by theorem [ pairing ] the pairing with @xmath267 is nondegenerate , it follows that the @xmath282 submatrix formed by the first @xmath279 columns of @xmath283 is nonsingular , thus @xmath283 has rank @xmath279 . on the other hand , since @xmath284 , it follows that @xmath285 hence there is a scalar @xmath286 such that @xmath287 , so @xmath288 . 
 it follows from lemma [ exact ] that for any polynomial @xmath276 the @xmath6-form @xmath289 lies in @xmath211 . thus if @xmath290 , then @xmath291 , hence @xmath292 for all polynomials @xmath276 . 
 since all @xmath6-forms in @xmath293 are of the form @xmath294 for some polynomial @xmath61 and any @xmath295 for some polynomial @xmath276 , it follows that @xmath296 is trivial , a contradiction . 
 thus @xmath297 , so @xmath298 and hence @xmath95 .","an exp - algebraic curve consists of a compact riemann surface @xmath0 together with @xmath1 equivalence classes of germs of meromorphic functions modulo germs of holomorphic functions , @xmath2 , \cdots , [ h_n ] \}$ ] , with poles of orders @xmath3 at points @xmath4 . 
 this data determines a space of functions @xmath5 ( respectively , a space of @xmath6-forms @xmath7 ) holomorphic on the punctured surface @xmath8 with exponential singularities at the points @xmath4 of types @xmath9 , \cdots , [ h_n]$ ] , i.e. , near @xmath10 any @xmath11 is of the form @xmath12 for some germ of meromorphic function @xmath13 ( respectively , any @xmath14 is of the form @xmath15 for some germ of meromorphic @xmath6-form ) .    for any @xmath14 
 the completion of @xmath16 with respect to the flat metric @xmath17 gives a space @xmath18 obtained by adding a finite set @xmath19 of @xmath20 points , and it is known that integration along curves produces a nondegenerate pairing of the relative homology @xmath21 with the derham cohomology group defined by @xmath22 . 
 there is a degree zero line bundle @xmath23 associated to an exp - algebraic curve , with a natural isomorphism between @xmath7 and the space @xmath24 of meromorphic @xmath23-valued @xmath6-forms which are holomorphic on @xmath16 , so that @xmath21 maps to a subspace @xmath25 . 
 we show that the exp - algebraic curve @xmath26 is determined uniquely by the pair @xmath27 .

"the star formation rate ( sfr ) of galaxies sets the rate at which galaxies grow and evolve and is the one of the most important measures for understanding the hierarchical build - up of our universe over cosmic time . 
 large scale simulations , however , have shown that unregulated star formation leads to an overabundance of high mass galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ? 
 * ; * ? ? ? 
 * ; * ? ? ? 
 therefore some process ( or processes ) must be able to stop , or `` quench , '' 
 star formation before the galaxy grows to be too big . 
 the answer seems to lie in supermassive black holes ( smbh ) which nearly all massive galaxies harbor in their centers . 
 smbhs grow through accretion of cold material ( active galactic nuclei ; agn ) , and the huge loss of gravitational energy of the cold material is converted into radiation that is evident across the whole electromagnetic spectrum and manifests itself as a bright point source in the nucleus of galaxies . 
 the agn can deposit this energy into the ism of its host galaxy through jets ( e.g. * ? ? ? 
 * ; * ? ? ? 
 * ; * ? ? ? 
 * ) or powerful outflows that either heat the gas or remove it altogether , i.e. `` feedback '' processes ( e.g * ? ? ? 
 * ; * ? ? ? 
 * ; * ? ? ? 
 * ; * ? ? ? 
 .    indirect evidence of this `` feedback '' has been observed through the simple , scaling relationships between the mass of the smbh and different properties of the host galaxy such as the stellar velocity dispersion in the bulge , the bulge mass , and the bulge luminosity ( e.g. * ? ? ? 
 * ; * ? ? ? 
 * ; * ? ? ? 
 * ; * ? ? ? 
 * ; * ? ? ? 
 * ; * ? ? ? 
 the relative tightness of these relationships suggests a strong coevolution of the host galaxy and smbh . 
 much debate remains however as to the exact mechanism of agn feedback and whether or not it plays a dominant role in the overall evolution of galaxies especially in light of new observations at both low and high @xmath5 that seem to deviate from the well - established relationships ( see * ? ? ? 
 * for a detailed review ) . 
 evidence for agn feedback though should also manifest itself in the sfr of its host galaxy , therefore much work has also focused on the so - called starburst - agn connection ( e.g. * ? ? ? 
 * ; * ? ? ? 
 * ; * ? ? ? 
 * ; * ? ? ? 
 * ; * ? ? ? 
 * ; * ? ? ? 
 * ; * ? ? ? 
 * ; * ? ? ? 
 * ; * ? ? ? 
 * ; * ? ? ? 
 the problem lies in determining accurate estimates of the sfr in agn host galaxies . 
 well - calibrated indicators , such as h@xmath6 emission and uv luminosity , are significantly , if not completely , contaminated by the central agn . 
 many studies therefore turn to the infrared ( ir ) regime ( @xmath7 @xmath1 m ) where dust re - emits the stellar light from young stars . 
 dust fills the interstellar medium ( ism ) of galaxies and plays an important part in the heating and cooling of the ism and the general physics of the galaxy . while dust contributes very little to the overall mass of a galaxy ( @xmath8 ) , the radiative output , mainly in the infrared ( ir ) regime , can , 
 on average , constitute roughly half of the bolometric luminosity of the entire galaxy @xcite , although there is an enormous range in the fraction . 
 dust efficiently absorbs optical and uv emission and re - radiates it in the mid- and far - infrared ( mir , fir ) depending on the temperature as well as grain size @xcite . 
 recently formed o and b stars produce the majority of the optical and uv light in galaxies , therefore measuring the total ir light from dust provides insights into the current ( @xmath9 myr ) star formation rate ( sfr ) ( e.g. * ? ? ? 
 * ) , although for very passive galaxies where the current sfr is much lower than it was earlier , ir emission can be an overestimate due to dust heating by an older stellar population.(e.g . 
 * )    however , dust is also the key component in obscuring our view of agn . 
 dust heated by the agn is thought to primarily live in a toroidal - like structure that encircles the agn and absorbs its radiative output for certain lines of sight . 
 the dusty torus is used to explain the dichotomy of agn into seyfert 1 ( sy 1 ) and seyfert 2 ( sy 2 ) within a unified model @xcite . 
 like o and b stars in star - forming regions , the agn outputs heavy amounts of optical and uv light , and like dust in the ism the dusty torus absorbs and re - emits this as ir radiation . 
 spectral energy distribution ( sed ) models @xcite as well as observations @xcite suggest the torus mainly emits in the mir ( @xmath10 @xmath1 m ) with the flux density dropping rapidly in the fir ( @xmath11 @xmath1 m ) . 
 further the sed for stellar dust re - radiation peaks in the fir @xcite , making the fir the ideal waveband to study star - formation in agn host galaxies . 
 space - based telescopes such as the _ infrared astronomical satellite _ ( iras ; * ? ? ? 
 * ) , _ spitzer space telescope _ 
 @xcite , and _ infrared space observatory _ 
 @xcite greatly expanded our knowledge of the ir universe and provided a window into the fir properties of galaxies . 
 but , before the launch of the _ herschel space observatory _ @xcite , the fir sed was limited to @xmath12 @xmath1 m , except for studies of small samples of the brightest galaxies using ground - based instruments such as _ scuba _ ( e.g. * ? ? ? 
 * ; * ? ? ? 
 herschel _ with the spectral and photometric imaging receiver ( spire ; * ? ? ? 
 * ) has pushed into the submillimeter range with observations in the 250 , 350 , and 500 @xmath1 m wavebands , probing the rayleigh - jeans tail of the modified blackbody that accurately describes the broadband fir sed of galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ? 
 * ; * ? ? ? 
 * ; * ? ? ? 
 these wavebands are crucial for measuring dust properties ( i.e. temperature and mass ) as @xcite and @xcite show . 
 further , @xcite found that fir and submillimeter data are important for estimating the sfr of agn host galaxies . 
 recent studies , such as @xcite and @xcite , focusing on the dust and star - forming properties of agn have shown the power of long wavelength _ 
 herschel _ data to better constrain the sfr , dust mass , and dust temperature in agn host galaxies . 
 @xcite analyzed the ir seds of low redshift ( @xmath13 ) , quasi - stellar objects ( qsos ) broadly finding most of the fir emission can be attributed to thermally - heated dust . 
 @xcite looked at the ir seds of 24 @xmath14 m selected agn at slightly higher redshift ( @xmath15 ) around galaxy clusters finding a strong correlation between the agn and star - forming luminosity which could be due to their shared correlation with galaxy stellar mass . 
 both studies , however , rely on agn selection using different wavebands ( optical vs. mid - infrared ) and generally probe the higher agn luminosity population . 
 therefore , we have assembled a large ( @xmath16 ) , low redshift ( @xmath0 ) sample of agn selected using ultra - hard x - ray observations with the _ swift_/_burst alert telescope _ 
 ( bat ) and imaged each one with _ 
 this sample focuses on moderate luminosity seyfert galaxies ( @xmath17 ) . in @xcite 
 , we presented the pacs data of the _ herschel_-bat agn which provided photometry at 70 and 160 @xmath1 m . in this paper 
 , we complete the fir sed of the bat agn with the creation and analysis of the spire images . 
 we focus on the overall luminosity distributions at the spire wavebands as well as the spire colors ( @xmath2 and @xmath3 ) to determine the likely heating sources of cold dust in agn host galaxies . 
 we also look for correlations with a proxy for the bolometric agn luminosity to potentially reveal any indication that agn heated dust is contributing to the fir sed . 
 this paper sets us up for a complete study of the mid - far ir sed to fully explore the star - forming properties of agn host galaxies and reveal the global starburst - agn connection in the nearby universe ( shimizu et al , in preparation ) . throughout this paper 
 we assume a @xmath18cdm cosmology with @xmath19 km s@xmath20 mpc@xmath21 , @xmath22 , and @xmath23 . 
 luminosity distances for each agn were calculated based on their redshift and assumed cosmology , except for those with @xmath24 where we referred to the _ _ extragalactic distance database__. 
 swift_/bat @xcite operates in the 14195 kev energy range , continuously monitoring the sky for gamma - ray bursts . 
 this constant monitoring has also allowed for the most complete all - sky survey in the ultra - hard x - rays . to date 
 , bat has detected 1171 sources at @xmath25 significance corresponding to a sensitivity of @xmath26 ergs s@xmath20 @xmath27 @xcite . over 700 of those sources 
 have been identified as a type of agn ( seyfert , blazar , qso , etc . ) 
 we selected our sample of 313 agn from the 58 month _ 
 swift_/bat catalog @xcite , imposing a redshift cutoff of @xmath0 . 
 all different types of agn were chosen only excluding blazars / bl lac objects which most likely introduce complicated beaming effects . to determine their agn type , for 252 sources we used the classifications from the bat agn spectroscopic survey ( koss et al , in preparation ) which compiled and analyzed optical spectra for the _ 
 swift_/bat 70 month catalog @xcite . 
 seyfert classification was determined using the standard scheme from @xcite and @xcite . for the remaining 61 agn we used the classifications provided in the 70 month catalog . in total 
 the sample contains 30 sy 1 , 30 sy 1.2 , 79 sy 1.5 , 1 sy 1.8 , 47 sy 1.9 , 121 sy 2 , 4 liners , and 1 unclassified agn . for the purpose of broad classification , in the rest of this paper we choose to classify all sy 1 - 1.5 as sy 1 s , and all sy 1.8 - 2 as st 2 s . in table 
 [ tbl : bat_info ] we list the entire _ herschel_-bat sample along with positions and redshifts taken from the _ nasa / ipac extragalactic database _ ( ned ) 
 .    selection of agn by ultra - hard x - rays provides multiple advantages over other wavelengths . due to their high energy , ultra - hard x - rays easily pass through compton - thin gas or dust in the line of sight providing a direct view of the agn . 
 using optical or mid - infrared selection can be problematic due to contamination by the host galaxy . also , 
 ultra - hard x - rays are unaffected by any type of absorption by material obscuring the agn provided it is optically thin to compton scattering ( @xmath28 ) which is a concern for hard x - rays in the 2 - 10 kev energy range . 
 numerous studies have been done on the bat sample in the past that span nearly the entire electromagnetic spectrum . @xcite and @xcite used _ 
 spitzer_/irs spectra to study the mid - infrared properties of the bat agn . @xcite and  @xcite studied the x - ray spectral properties for a subsample , while @xcite looked at the optical host galaxy properties and @xcite analyzed the optical spectra . along with these 
 , many of the bat agn are detected at radio wavelengths with the first @xcite and nvss @xcite survey as well . 
 one key ingredient missing though is the far - infrared ( fir ) where emission from ultraviolet - heated dust peaks .    [ 
 cols=""<,<,<,^,^,<,^,^ "" , ]     while all the relationships show some amount of correlation with very low ( @xmath29 1% ) probabilities of occurring by chance , the strongest ones occur between wavelengths that are nearest each other . 
 the 160 vs. 250 @xmath1 m and 250 vs. 350 @xmath1 m correlations have a correlation coefficient @xmath30 . 
 this makes sense within the context of multiple temperature components . 
 photometry from nearby wavelengths should be produced from closely related temperature components . 
 the weak correlation between 70 and 500 @xmath1 m indicates the emission in these wavebands does not originate from closely related processes . 
 70 @xmath1 m emission comes from much hotter and smaller dust grains than 500 @xmath1 m and several processes could provide an explanation . since this is an agn sample , there could be a strong contribution from agn heated dust at 70 @xmath1 m , whereas at 500 @xmath1 m , agn related emission would likely be negligible . 
 this is supported by our findings in @xcite where we showed that the 70 @xmath1 m luminosity is weakly correlated with agn luminosity . 
 further , in @xcite we found that the bat agn morphologies at 70 @xmath1 m were concentrated in the nucleus potentially indicating an agn contribution . 
 the weak correlation , however , can also be explained if non - star - forming processes also contribute to the 500 @xmath1 m emission . 
 while in non - agn galaxies , the majority of 70 @xmath1 m emission is most likely due to small , stochastically heated dust grains around hii regions , @xmath31 @xmath1 m emission is likely produced by the heating of larger dust grains in the diffuse ism by older stars ( e.g. * ? ? ? 
 therefore , the disconnect between the stellar populations would produce significant scatter in the correlation between 70 and 500 @xmath1 m . 
 a third possibility is that synchrotron radiation produced by radio jets associated with agn can contribute to the fir , especially the longest wavelengths as seen in some radio - loud galaxies @xcite . 
 this non - thermal emission would be completely unrelated to the thermal emission at 70 @xmath1 m , thereby producing a weaker correlation between the luminosities at those wavebands . in a later section 
 we will show there are indeed some radio - loud sources in our sample where synchrotron emission dominates the spire emission , although the fraction of sources is quite low . 
 when we break the sample down into sy 1 s and 2 s we do not find much difference between the correlation coefficients . 
 this shows that sy 1 s and 2 s are not different in terms of their overall fir emission and the same processes are likely producing the fir emission . 
 sy 1 s do show a slightly weaker correlation between the _ herschel _ luminosities especially the ones involving 500 @xmath1 m . 
 this is likely due to the fact that most radio - loud agn are classified as sy 1 s so synchrotron emission is contributing strongest at 500 @xmath1 m compared to the other wavebands . 
 correlations between each spire waveband luminosity and the bat 14195 kev luminosity . 
 blue circles in the left column represent sy 1 s . 
 red squares in the right column are sy 2 s . 
 sources with gray arrows indicate @xmath32 upper limits . ] 
 ultra - hard x - ray luminosity directly probes the current strength of the agn because it likely originates very close to the smbh . 
 the 14195 kev luminosity then provides an unambiguous measure of the agn power especially for compton - thin sources . 
 if we want to determine whether the agn contributes in any way to the fir luminosity , the first check would be to correlate the 14195 kev luminosity with each waveband s luminosity . 
 @xcite ran correlation tests for the pacs wavebands finding a weak , but statistically significant correlation between the 70 and 160 @xmath1 m luminosity and the 14195 kev luminosity for sy 1 s but not for sy 2 s .    using the same methods as we did to measure strengths of the correlations between each _ herschel _ luminosity , we measured the correlation between each spire and 14195 kev luminosity . 
 the last lines of each section of table  [ tab : wave_corrs ] lists the results of the correlation tests and figure  [ fig : lum_spire_bat ] plots the correlations with gray arrows indicating upper limits .    for the agn sample as a whole , no significant correlation exists between the spire and 14195 kev luminosity . 
 all of the @xmath33 , after accounting for the partial correlation with distance , are below 0.1 with @xmath34 either at or above 5% . 
 however , when we break the sample up into sy 1 s and sy 2 s and redo the correlation tests , we find a very weak correlation between the 250 and 350 @xmath1 m luminosity and ultra - hard x - ray luminosity for sy 1 s only ( @xmath35 and 0.10 ) . 
 sy 2 s @xmath33 are consistent with no correlation with @xmath36 for all three wavebands . 
 this continues the trend with what was found in @xcite where only sy 1 s were found to have a weak correlation between the bat luminosity and the pacs waveband luminosities . 
 the partial correlation coefficients were @xmath37 and @xmath38 for sy 1s and @xmath39 and @xmath40 for sy 2 s at 70 and 160 @xmath1 m respectively ( see table 3 of * ? ? ? * ) * * * * . 
 we note however that except for the 70 @xmath1 m waveband , none of the correlation coefficients are @xmath41 away from a null correlation coefficient . 
 so even though @xmath42 , these are all quite weak correlations between the _ herschel _ wavebands and bat luminosity for sy 1 s . at 500 @xmath1 m , the correlation completely disappears . 
 as we discuss in @xcite , this extends the trend observed in the mir where strong correlations have been measured between the 9 , 12 , and 18 @xmath1 m luminosities and the bat luminosity @xcite but moving towards longer wavelengths the correlation degrades rapidly as shown in @xcite for 90 @xmath1 m emission . 
 clearly then , at long wavelengths ( @xmath43 @xmath1 m ) , emission from dust unrelated to the agn dominates most galaxies . 
 however , we must still explain why sy 1 s retain a weak correlation while sy 2 s do not . 
 @xcite discussed in detail several theories for why sy 1 s would show a different correlation between the _ herschel _ luminosities and bat luminosity . 
 these included an intrinsically different bat luminosity distribution for sy 1 s and sy 2 s and the addition of compton - thick ( ct ) agn in the sy 2 sample . 
 several authors have found that the sy 2 luminosity function breaks at a significantly lower luminosity than for sy 1s ( e.g. * ? ? ? 
 * ; * ? ? ? 
 * ; * ? ? ? 
 * ) . at low bat luminosity , 
 then , there are more sy 2 s than sy 1 s as is evident in figure  [ fig : lum_spire_bat ] . 
 @xcite showed that at low agn luminosity the correlation between sfr and agn luminosity flattens . 
 this can be explained one of two ways : 1 . ) only at high agn luminosity is there a direct connection between star formation and agn activity . 
 2 . ) at high agn luminosity , the ir - related agn emission overwhelms any star - forming related ir emission even at long wavelengths . 
 regardless of the physical reason , the flattening of the sf - agn relationship at low luminosity could explain the correlation differences seen between sy 1s and sy 2s since sy 2s are preferentially found at lower luminosity than sy 1s . 
 @xcite tested this for the pacs wavebands and found that only using high luminosity objects did not improve the x - ray - to - ir correlation for sy 2 s . 
 we repeated this test with the spire luminosities and limited the samples to only agn with bat luminosity greater than @xmath44 ergs s@xmath20 . for both sy 1 s and sy 2 s 
 the correlations become insignificant , likely because of the reduction in number of sources used in the analysis . 
 it is then inconclusive whether or not a difference in intrinsic agn luminosity is the cause of the differences in correlations between x - ray and ir luminosity for sy 1 s and sy 2 s . 
 the other possibility is that ct sources are contaminating the sy 2 sample . 
 this would have an effect if the high column density ( @xmath45 @xmath27 ) material obscuring the agn scatters 14 - 195 kev photons out of our line sight causing a lower measured bat luminosity . 
 @xcite identified 44 either confirmed ct agn or likely ct agn based on x - ray hardness ratios in our sample . 
 we removed these likely ct sources and redid the correlation tests , finding no difference from before just as @xcite found . 
 therefore , it is unlikely that ct sources are the cause of the difference between the sy 1 and sy 2 correlations . 
 given the inconclusiveness of the first test limiting the sample to high luminosity objects , we can only speculate about the reason for the difference in correlations . 
 however , @xcite did find that restricting the sample to high luminosity objects increased the strength of the correlation for sy 1 s but not sy 2 s in the pacs wavebands . 
 it is possible then that either a direct physical link between the sfr and agn luminosity that is only evident in high luminosity agn or increased contamination of the agn to the ir sed is causing the relatively stronger correlation in sy 1s but not sy 2s . 
 what is conclusive is that the spire emission from the agn host galaxies on average is not strongly contaminated by agn - related emission given the small values for the correlation coefficients even for sy 1 s .      while in the previous sections , we examined the absolute luminosities of each spire waveband and the correlations between each other and other wavebands ( pacs and bat ) , in this section we examine the spire colors ( i.e. flux ratios ) . 
 colors in general provide measures of the shape of the sed . 
 different objects and mechanisms produce significantly different sed shapes across the same wavelength regime , therefore colors can be used to separate distinct populations from each other especially when groups display the same absolute brightnesses . 
 we investigate two colors , @xmath2 and @xmath3 , that probe the rayleigh jeans tail of a modified blackbody if the dominant process producing the emission is cold dust . 
 figure  [ fig : hist_colors ] plots the kde of the two colors . 
 the top row compares the distribution of the colors ( @xmath2 on the left and @xmath3 on the right ) from the bat agn and hrs samples . 
 while the hrs galaxies are local like the bat agn , one major difference is the stellar mass distribution . 
 the hrs sample contains more low stellar mass galaxies while the bat agn are strictly found in galaxies with stellar mass ( @xmath46 ) values above @xmath47 m@xmath48 @xcite .    as @xcite 
 show , fir colors can be affected by the physical properties of the galaxy , especially the colors probing the cold dust such as the ones we are investigating here . therefore , we broke the hrs sample into two groups , a high mass group ( @xmath49 m@xmath48 ) and low mass one ( @xmath49 m@xmath48 ) indicated in figure  [ fig : hist_colors ] by the solid and dashed green lines . 
 stellar masses for the hrs were obtained from @xcite . 
 we also plot the theoretical color of the modified blackbody with a dust temperature of 20 k and emissivity ( @xmath50 ) of 2.0 and 1.5 , values typical of normal , star - forming galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ? 
 * ; * ? ? ? 
 * ; * ? ? ? 
 * ; * ? ? ? 
 * ; * ? ? ? 
 * ) . the hrs high mass group and bat agn display nearly identical color distributions for both colors whereas the hrs low mass group is skewed toward lower colors . results of a k - s test show that the hrs high mass group and bat agn colors are drawn from the same parent population with a @xmath51 and 22% for @xmath2 and @xmath3 respectively . on the other hand 
 the hrs low mass group colors are significantly different from the bat agn with @xmath52 values much less than 1% . 
 this is consistent with what was found in @xcite , who showed that the spire colors for the hrs sample were affected by the metallicity of the galaxy with metal rich galaxies displaying larger flux ratios and a higher @xmath50 than metal poor ones . 
 given the strong , positive relationship between metallicity and @xmath46 ( e.g. * ? ? ? 
 * ) , this is exactly in line with what is seen in figure  [ fig : hist_colors ] . the hrs high mass group and bat agn display colors closer to the ones expected for a modified blackbody with @xmath53 while the low mass hrs group are closer to @xmath54 .            in figure 
 [ fig : color - color ] we plot both colors together for the hrs and bat agn . 
 nearly all of the hrs galaxies are concentrated along a main locus as well as many of the bat agn . 
 we also plot the expected colors for a modified blackbody with varying temperature between 10 and 60 k and an emissivity of either 2.0 ( green line and squares ) or 1.5 ( purple line and diamonds ) . each square or diamond represents an increase of 5 k starting at 10 k in the lower left . 
 the main locus for both samples is clearly aligned with a modified blackbody with temperatures between 1530 k. @xcite fit the fir sed of the hrs sample using a single temperature modified blackbody finding exactly this range of temperatures and an average emissivity of 1.8 . 
 further these values are consistent with dust in the milky way , andromeda , and other nearby galaxies @xcite .      in the bottom rows , 
 we compare sy 1 s and sy 2 s . 
 based on the results of our analysis in section  [ sec : det_rate_lum_dist ] , we would expect sy 1 s and sy 2 s to show the same distribution of colors . 
 indeed this is the case as both distributions in both colors peak at nearly the same values and have nearly the same spread . 
 k - s tests reveal the colors for the two seyfert types are drawn from the same parent population with @xmath55 for @xmath2 and @xmath56 for @xmath3 .      while the bulk of the spire colors are very similar between the hrs and bat , and the two seyfert types , one noticeable difference is a distinct bump in the color distribution around 0.75 . 
 this bump is absent in the hrs sample and mainly is made up of sy 1s . with both flux ratios less than one , this indicates a monotonically rising sed that is in stark contrast with the rapidly declining sed characteristic of a modified blackbody . 
 the equation for a modified blackbody is @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the standard planck blackbody function with a temperature of @xmath59 . 
 the bump seen in figure  [ fig : hist_colors ] is very evident in figure  [ fig : color - color ] as a separate population in the lower left - hand corner . 
 specifically 6 bat agn and one hrs galaxy occupy the region of color - color space where @xmath60 and @xmath61 . 
 based on the theoretical curves , these exceptional colors can not be explained as either a different temperature or emissivity . 
 rather an entirely different process is producing the fir emission in these galaxies and since the colors indicate essentially a rising sed , we suspected synchrotron radiation as the likely emission mechanism with its characteristic increasing power law shape with wavelength . 
 further there seems to be a horizontal spread in the distribution of the bat agn in figure  [ fig : color - color ] that is clearly not evident in the hrs . 
 also this effect is not seen figure  [ fig : hist_colors ] and the kdes because it only becomes evident when analyzing the two colors together . 
 both samples span the same range of colors , however their distribution in color - color space is different . 
 this is characterized by a large group of bat agn above and to the left of the main locus and @xmath62 line ( purple ) as well as a smaller group of agn below and to the right of the main locus and @xmath63 line ( green ) . 
 the latter group can be explained simply from a decrease in temperature and increase in emissivity up to a beta value of 3.0 ( cyan line in figure  [ fig : hist_colors ] ) , indicating the prevalence of large amounts of cold dust . 
 the former group could be explained by a decrease in the emissivity closer to around values of 1.0 ( gray line ) , however this would require the dust temperature to increase to values above 60 k , not typical of regular star - forming galaxies . 
 rather these high temperatures ( 70100 k ) are near the expected temperatures for dust heated by the agn , which show characteristic peaks in their sed between 2040 @xmath1 m @xcite . 
 if the agn is affecting the colors of these sources more than the ones on the main locus then there should be some correlation between the offset from the main locus and an indicator of agn strength such as x - ray luminosity . 
 to quantify the offset from the main locus , we fit the sed of all of the sources in figure  [ fig : color - color ] using a modified blackbody ( eq .  [ eq : mod_blackbody ] ) with a fixed emissivity of 2.0 to measure the excess or deficiency of observed 500 @xmath1 m emission compared to the model .    with the emissivity fixed at 2.0 , 
 there are only two free parameters , the dust temperature and normalization . 
 we fit the sources within a bayesian framework using uniform priors for the logarithm of the normalization and dust temperature and a standard gaussian likelihood function . to sample the posterior probability density function , we use the ` emcee ` package @xcite that implements the affine - invariant ensemble sampler for markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) originally proposed by @xcite . 
 for the model fitting , we only use 160 , 250 , and 350 @xmath1 m flux densities . 
 we exclude the 500 @xmath1 m data point because our aim is to compare the expected 500 @xmath1 m emission from the model with the observed one and do not want the fitting influenced by the observed emission . 
 we also exclude the 70 @xmath1 m flux density because it can be dominated by emission from hotter dust heated by young stars in dense star - forming regions or the agn itself @xcite . 
 each sample from the mcmc chain contains values for the parameters of the modified blackbody that are likely given the posterior distribution . from all of these parameters 
 , we calculated 40000 modeled 500 @xmath1 m emission and `` excess '' using the following equation : @xmath64 @xmath4 then represents a fractional excess ( or deficiency ) as compared to the model emission . 
 a deficiency would be indicated by a negative value for @xmath4 . the final excess value associated with the source 
 is then determined as the median of all of the excess values . in figure 
 [ fig : color - color_excess ] we plot the same color - color diagram as in figure  [ fig : color - color ] with each point colored by its measured @xmath4 .        in general 
 , points with low values of the @xmath3 color show high values of @xmath4 and vice versa for high values of the @xmath3 color . 
 points along the main locus are scattered around @xmath65 . 
 thus , @xmath4 can quantify a source s distance from the main locus and allows us to study possible causes for this excess emission at 500 @xmath1 m . 
 we first measure the correlation between @xmath4 and radio loudness . 
 agn historically have been classified into two groups based on how bright their radio emission is compared to another waveband , usually optical . 
 these groups are `` radio - loud '' and `` radio - quiet '' agn with the former group showing bright radio emission and the latter faint radio emission relative to the optical or x - ray emission @xcite . 
 while originally radio - loud and radio - quiet agn seemed to form a dichotomy , the consensus now seems to be that there is a broad distribution of radio - loudness rather than a bimodality @xcite . 
 further , the original radio loudness parameter , @xmath66 which measured the ratio of the radio to optical luminosity , was shown to underestimate the radio loudness especially for low - luminosity seyfert galaxies @xcite . 
 rather @xmath67 which measures the nuclear radio to x - ray luminosity ratio was confirmed to be a better radio - loudness indicator given x - rays are less affected by obscuration and contamination from the host galaxy . 
 therefore , for the bat agn , we use @xmath68 to measure the radio - loudness with @xmath69 and @xmath70 .    for @xmath71 
 we first cross - correlated the bat agn with the first and nvss databases which provide 1.4 ghz flux densities over all of the northern sky . 
 first flux densities were preferred over nvss due to the much better angular resolution ( 5 `` vs. 45 '' ) . since _ 
 swift_/bat was an all - sky survey , nearly half of the bat agn were not included in either first or nvss . for these southern sources we turned to the sydney university molonglo sky survey ( sumss ; * ? ? ? * ) which surveyed the southern sky at 843 mhz . 
 finally , for the remaining sources missing radio data , we performed a literature search and found 5 ghz fluxes from various other studies @xcite . to convert all flux densities to 1.4 ghz 
 , we assumed a power - law spectrum , @xmath72 , that is typical for synchrotron emission .        figure  [ fig : excess_vs_rx ] plots @xmath73 against @xmath68 to test our hypothesis that the excess 500 @xmath1 m emission is related to the radio loudness of the agn . 
 in the left panel we plot all of the sources together to show the full range of @xmath73 . 
 indeed , the six agn with the largest values of @xmath73 exhibit high values of radio loudness ( @xmath74 ) . 
 these six agn are hb 890241 + 622 , 2masx j23272195 + 1524375 , 3c 111.0 , 3c 120 , pictor a , and pks 2331 - 240 and all are well known radio - loud agn . 
 they correspond to the six sources in figures  [ fig : color - color ] and [ fig : color - color_excess ] that lie in the lower left hand corner . 
 further , the lone hrs galaxy seen in figure  [ fig : color - color ] among the six bat agn is the radio galaxy m87 , whose jets and radio activity have been studied extensively . based on this , we prescribe color cutoffs that can easily separate radio - loud agn from radio - quiet agn and normal star - forming galaxies : @xmath60 and @xmath61 ( see dashed lines in figure  [ fig : color - color_excess ] ) . 
 while radio - loudness can explain the most extreme values of @xmath73 , it does not explain the more moderate ones . 
 in the right panel of figure  [ fig : excess_vs_rx ] , we zoom in on the agn with @xmath75 . 
 visually there does not appear to be any strong correlation between @xmath68 and @xmath73 and the spearman rank correlation coefficient between them is -0.15 , weak and in the opposite sense of what would be expected if synchrotron emission was contaminating the 500 @xmath1 m emission .    to explore even further 
 , we analyzed the correlations between @xmath73 and two agn - related indicators , the _ swift_/bat luminosity , @xmath76 , and the 3.4 to 4.6 @xmath1 m flux ratio ( @xmath77 ) . 
 the 3.4 ( @xmath78 ) and 4.6 ( @xmath79 ) @xmath1 m fluxes for the bat agn were obtained from the _ wide - field infrared survey explorer _ ( _ wise _ ; * ? ? ? 
 * ) allwise catalog accessed through the _ nasa / ipac _ infrared science archive ( irsa ) 
 . details of the compilation of _ wise _ fluxes for the bat agn will be available in an upcoming publication ( shimizu et al . in preparation ) . 
 @xcite showed that @xmath76 can be used as a measure of the intrinsic bolometric luminosity of the agn , unaffected by host galaxy contamination or line - of - sight absorption . 
 @xmath77 has been shown to be an effective discriminator between agn - dominated and normal star - forming galaxies that has both high reliability and completeness @xcite in magnitude units for selecting agn . in flux units 
 this changes to @xmath80 . 
 @xcite also show that as the fraction of emission coming from the host galaxy increases @xmath77 increases as well making it a good measure of the relative contribution of the agn to the infrared luminosity . 
 [ fig : excess_vs_agn ] shows the relationships between both @xmath81 ( left panel ) and @xmath77 ( right panel ) with @xmath73 after removing the six radio - loud agn . 
 both parameters display noticeable correlations with @xmath73 with @xmath81 positively correlated and @xmath77 negatively correlated . 
 we calculated spearman rank correlation coefficients finding values of 0.49 and -0.49 respectively . 
 pearson correlation coefficients are 0.30 and -0.50 respectively reflecting the more linear relationship between @xmath73 and @xmath77 than the one between @xmath73 and @xmath81 . 
 all correlations have a probability of a null correlation less than 0.01% . in the right panel 
 we also plot the @xcite cutoff for agn - dominated galaxies where values to the left of this line indicate agn - dominated colors . 
 both panels indicate that the strength of the agn in the host galaxy is possibly having an effect on the spire colors . 
 a stronger agn in relation to the host galaxy is causing deviations from a standard modified blackbody in the form of a small but noticeable 500 @xmath1 m offset .    without longer wavelength data , 
 however , its impossible to determine the exact cause of the 500 @xmath1 m excess so we can only speculate . submillimeter excess emission has been observed in a number of objects including dwarf and normal star - forming galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ? 
 * ; * ? ? ? 
 * ; * ? ? ? 
 * ; * ? ? ? 
 * ) as well as the small and large magellanic clouds @xcite and even our own milky way @xcite . 
 various explanations have been proposed including the presence of a very cold ( @xmath82 k ) component @xcite , grain coagulation that causes the emissivity to increase for colder temperatures @xcite , fluctuations in the cosmic microwave background @xcite , and an increase in magnetic material in the ism @xcite . 
 while all of these explanations are certainly still possible to explain the excess seen in the bat agn , they lack any direct connection to the strength of the agn . 
 further , a key result from all of the previous work is that the submillimeter excess is more prevalent in very metal - poor galaxies ( @xmath83 ) . 
 all of the bat agn reside in high stellar mass galaxies @xcite and given the mass - metallicity relationship @xcite should also be quite metal rich .    rather , we speculate the excess is related to radio emission more closely associated with the agn itself . 
 several studies of the radio properties of agn have revealed a millimeter excess around 100 ghz @xcite that is likely due to either an inverted or flat sed between cm and mm wavelengths . because @xcite found the excess mainly in low luminosity agn similar to sgr a * , they invoked advection dominated accretion flows ( adaf ) that produce compact nuclear jets to explain the inverter or flat seds 
 . however the sample of @xcite was composed of x - ray bright agn including high eddington ratio ( @xmath84 , a measure of the accretion rate relative to the eddington limit ) sources where an adaf is unlikely . 
 @xcite instead use the radio - to - x - ray luminosity ratio to argue that the high - frequency radio emission originates near the x - ray corona of the accretion disk given the ratio s similarity to that found for stellar coronal mass ejections ( e.g * ? ? ? 
 * ) as well as the compact nature of the radio emission . 
 magnetic activity around the accretion disk in the core of the agn would then be responsible for the excess and if magnetic activity increases with @xmath84 , this could explain the relationship seen with @xmath81 as well as @xmath77 . 
 this strengthens the need for a more comprehensive survey of agn in the mm wavelength range as it could clearly reveal interesting physics possibly occurring near the accretion disk . 
 we have produced the _ 
 herschel_/spire maps for 313 agn selected from the _ 
 swift_/bat 58 month catalog in three wavebands : 250 , 350 , and 500 @xmath1 m . combined with the pacs photometry from @xcite , the spire flux densities presented in this paper form the complete fir seds for a large , nearby , and relatively unbiased sample of agn . 
 we used two methods for measuring the flux densities : timeline fitting for point sources and aperture photometry for extended and undetected sources . 
 we summarize below the results of our statistical analysis and comparison to the _ herschel _ reference survey sample of normal star - forming galaxies . 
 * sy 2s are detected at a higher rate than sy 1s , and after accounting for upper limits , sy 2 s have slightly higher spire luminosities than sy 1 s . however the effect is small and indicates that on average , the global fir properties of agn are independent of orientation . * using a partial correlation survival analysis to account for the luminosity - distance effect and upper limits , we find all of the _ herschel _ luminosities are correlated with each other suggesting the process ( or processes ) producing the emission from 70500 @xmath1 m is connected . 
 luminosities with the smallest wavelength difference ( i.e. 160 and 250 @xmath1 m ) are much more correlated than pairs further apart ( i.e. 70 and 500 @xmath1 m ) , in agreement with different temperature components associated with different wavebands . while this could point to the agn affecting the shorter wavebands more than the longer ones and increasing the scatter , it can also be explained by an increased contribution from older stellar populations to the emission at longer wavelengths . * 
 none of the spire luminosities are well correlated with the 14195 kev luminosity , a proxy for the bolometric agn luminosity . 
 the agn , in general , is unlikely to be strongly affecting either the 250 , 350 , or 500 @xmath1 m emission , however sy 1s do show a very weak correlation at 250 and 350 @xmath1 m . removing ct sources does not improve the correlation for sy 2 s . 
 it remains to be seen what the exact explanation is for the difference in correlations between sy 1s and sy 2s but possible explanations include a direct link between star - formation and agn luminosity that is evident only at high luminosity or increased contamination by the agn . 
 * we compared the spire colors , @xmath2 and @xmath3 , with the colors of the hrs galaxies . 
 the bat agn have statistically similar spire color distributions as the high stellar mass ( @xmath85 m@xmath48 ) hrs galaxies . 
 this further emphasizes that on average , the fir emission of agn host galaxies is likely produced by cold dust in the ism heated by stellar radiation just as in normal star - forming galaxies without an agn . 
 * we did find anomalous colors for 6 bat agn with @xmath60 and @xmath61 . 
 the fir seds for these agn are dominated by synchrotron emission from a radio jet rather than thermally heated dust . * 
 another group of agn with less anomalous colors but still removed from the main locus were analyzed by fitting the seds with a modified blackbody and calculating a 500 @xmath1 m excess . 
 we found the 500 @xmath1 m excess is not related to radio loudness , but is well correlated with the 14195 kev luminosity and @xmath77 ( 3.4/4.6 @xmath1 m ) color from _ 
 wise_. we speculate this is possibly related to the millimeter excess emission recently seen in agn caused by coronal emission above the accretion disk . 
 future work will focus on combining the photometry from @xcite and this paper as well as archival data to perform detailed sed modeling to investigate the local starburst - agn connection and the agn contribution to the fir .

 we selected agn from the 58 month _ swift _ burst alert telescope ( bat ) catalog , the result of an all - sky survey in the 14195 kev energy band , allowing for a reduction in agn selection effects due to obscuration and host galaxy contamination . 
 we find 46% ( 143/313 ) of our sample is detected at all three wavebands and combined with our pacs observations represents the most complete fir spectral energy distributions of local , moderate luminosity agn . 
 we find no correlation between the 250 , 350 , and 500 @xmath1 m luminosities with 14195 kev luminosity , indicating the bulk of the fir emission is not related to the agn . 
 however , seyfert 1s do show a very weak correlation with x - ray luminosity compared to seyfert 2s and we discuss possible explanations . 
 we compare the spire colors ( @xmath2 and @xmath3 ) to a sample of normal star - forming galaxies , finding the two samples are statistically similar , especially after matching in stellar mass . but a color - color plot reveals a fraction of the _ herschel_-bat agn are displaced from the normal star - forming galaxies due to excess 500 @xmath1 m emission ( @xmath4 ) . 
 our analysis shows @xmath4 is strongly correlated with the 14195 kev luminosity and 3.4/4.6 @xmath1 m flux ratio , evidence the excess is related to the agn . 
 we speculate these sources are experiencing millimeter excess emission originating in the corona of the accretion disk .

"the fundamental group of the complement of plane curves is a very important topological invariant , which can be also computed for line arrangements . we list here some applications of this invariant . 
 chisini @xcite , kulikov @xcite and kulikov - teicher @xcite have used the fundamental group of complements of branch curves of generic projections in order to distinguish between connected components of the moduli space of smooth projective surfaces , see also @xcite . 
 moreover , the zariski - lefschetz hyperplane section theorem ( see @xcite ) states that @xmath3 where @xmath4 is an hypersurface and @xmath5 is a generic 2-plane . 
 since @xmath6 is a plane curve , the fundamental groups of complements of curves can be used also for computing the fundamental groups of complements of hypersurfaces in @xmath7 .    a different need for fundamental groups computations 
 arises in the search for more examples of zariski pairs @xcite . 
 a pair of plane curves is called _ a zariski pair _ if they have the same combinatorics ( to be exact : there is a degree - preserving bijection between the set of irreducible components of the two curves @xmath8 , and there exist regular neighbourhoods of the curves @xmath9 such that the pairs @xmath10 are homeomorphic and the homeomorphism respects the bijection above @xcite ) , but their complements in @xmath11 are not homeomorphic . for a survey , 
 see @xcite . 
 it is also interesting to explore new finite non - abelian groups which serve as fundamental groups of complements of plane curves in general , see for example @xcite . 
 an arrangement of lines in @xmath12 is a union of copies of @xmath13 in @xmath12 
 . such an arrangement is called _ real _ if the defining equations of the lines can be written with real coefficients , and _ complex _ otherwise . note 
 that the intersection of the affine part of a real arrangement with the natural copy of @xmath14 in @xmath12 is an arrangement of lines in the real plane .    for real and complex line arrangements @xmath0 , 
 fan @xcite defined a graph @xmath15 which is associated to its multiple points ( i.e. points where more than two lines are intersected ) : given a line arrangement @xmath0 , the graph @xmath15 of multiple points lies on @xmath0 . 
 it consists of the multiple points of @xmath0 , with the segments between the multiple points on lines which have at least two multiple points . 
 note that if the arrangement consists of three multiple points on the same line , then @xmath15 has three vertices on the same line ( see figure [ graph_gl](a ) ) . if two such lines happen to intersect in a simple point ( i.e. a point where exactly two lines are intersected ) , it is ignored ( and the lines are not considered to meet in the graph theoretic sense ) . 
 see another example in figure [ graph_gl](b ) ( note that this definition gives a graph different from the graph defined in @xcite ) . 
 fan @xcite proved some results concerning the projective fundamental group :    [ fan ] let @xmath0 be a complex arrangement of @xmath16 lines and@xmath17 be the set of all multiple points of @xmath0 . 
 suppose that @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the first betti number of the graph @xmath15 ( hence @xmath18 means that the graph @xmath15 has no cycles ) . 
 then : @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the multiplicity of the intersection point @xmath22 and @xmath23 .    in @xcite , 
 similar results were achieved for the affine and projective fundamental groups by different methods . 
 fan @xcite has conjectured that the inverse implication is also correct , i.e. if the fundamental group @xmath24 can be written as a direct sum of free groups and infinite cyclic groups , then the graph @xmath15 has no cycles .    in an unpublished note 
 , fan @xcite shows that if the fundamental group of the affine complement is a free group , then the arrangement consists of parallel lines . 
 recently , eliyahu , liberman , schaps and teicher @xcite proved fan s conjecture completely . 
 these results motivate the following definition :    let @xmath25 be a fundamental group of the affine or projective complements of some line arrangement with @xmath16 lines . 
 we say that @xmath25 has _ a conjugation - free geometric presentation _ if @xmath25 has a presentation with the following properties :    * in the affine case , the generators @xmath26 are the meridians of lines at some far side of the arrangement , and therefore the number of generators is equal to @xmath16 . * in the projective case , the generators are the meridians of lines at some far side of the arrangement except for one , and therefore the number of generators is equal to @xmath27 . * in both cases , the relations are of the following type : @xmath28 where @xmath29 is an increasing subsequence of indices , where @xmath30 in the affine case and @xmath31 in the projective case . 
 note that for @xmath32 we get the usual commutator . 
 note that in usual geometric presentations of the fundamental group , most of the relations have conjugations ( see section [ mt ] ) . 
 based on the last definition , fan s result yields that if the graph associated to the arrangement is acyclic , then the corresponding fundamental group has a conjugation - free geometric presentation .    the following natural problem arises :    which line arrangements have a fundamental group which has a conjugation - free geometric presentation ? 
 the aim of this paper is to attack this problem . 
 the importance of this family of arrangements is that the fundamental group can be read directly from the arrangement or equivalently from its incidence lattice ( where the _ incidence lattice _ of an arrangement is the partially - ordered set of non - empty intersections of the lines , ordered by inclusion , see @xcite ) without any computation . 
 hence , for this family of arrangements , the incidence lattice determines the fundamental group of the complement . 
 we start with the easy fact that there exist arrangements whose fundamental groups have no conjugation - free geometric presentation : the fundamental group of the affine ceva arrangement ( also known as the _ braid arrangement _ , appears in figure [ ceva ] ) has no conjugation - free geometric presentation . 
 this fact was checked computationally by a package called _ testisom _ 
 @xcite , which looks for isomorphisms ( or proves a non - isomorphism ) between two given finitely - presented group . 
 note that the ceva arrangement is the minimal arrangement ( with respect to the number of lines ) with this property . 
 our main result is :    the fundamental group of following family of real arrangements have a conjugation - free geometric presentation : an arrangement @xmath0 , where @xmath15 is a union of disjoint cycles of any length , has no line with more than two multiple points , and the multiplicities of the multiple points are arbitrary . 
 we also give the exact group structure ( by means of a semi - direct product ) of the fundamental group for an arrangement of @xmath1 lines whose graph is a cycle of length @xmath2 ( i.e. a triangle ) , where all the multiple points are of multiplicity @xmath2 :    let @xmath0 be the real arrangement of @xmath1 lines , whose graph consists of a cycle of length @xmath2 , where all the multiple points are of multiplicity @xmath2 . 
 moreover , it has no line with more than two multiple points . 
 then : @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the free product . 
 as mentioned above , for the family of arrangements with a conjugation - free geometric presentation of the fundamental group , the incidence lattice of the arrangement determines its fundamental group . 
 there are some well - known families of arrangements whose lattice determines the fundamental group of its complement - the families of _ nice _ arrangements ( jiang - yau @xcite ) and _ simple _ arrangements ( wang - yau @xcite ) . 
 it is interesting to study the relation between these families and the family of arrangements whose fundamental groups have conjugation - free geometric presentations , since for the latter family , the lattice determines the fundamental group of the complement too . 
 we have the following remark :    the fundamental group of the arrangement @xmath35 ( appears in figure [ a_n ] ) has a conjugation - free geometric presentation ( this fact was checked computationally ) , but this arrangement is neither nice nor simple 
 .    it will be interesting to find out whether our family of arrangements is broader than the family of simple arrangements , or whether there exists a simple arrangement whose fundamental group has no conjugation - free geometric presentation . 
 [ rem_dehornoy ] it is worth to mention that conjugation - free geometric presentations are complemented positive presentations ( defined by dehornoy @xcite , see also @xcite ) . 
 some initial computations show that in general conjugation - free geometric presentations are not complete ( since the cube condition is not satisfied for some triples of generators ) . 
 nevertheless , we do think that there exist conjugation - free geometric presentations which are complete and hence have all the good properties induced by the completeness ( see the survey @xcite ) . 
 we will discuss this subject in a different paper . 
 the paper is organized as follows . in section [ mt ] , 
 we give a quick survey of the techniques we are using throughout the paper . in section [ length_three ] , we show that the fundamental group of a real arrangement whose graph has a unique cycle of length 3 has a conjugation - free geometric presentation . in this section 
 , we also deal with the exact structure of the fundamental group of a real arrangement whose graph consists of a cycle of length @xmath2 , where all the multiple points have multiplicity @xmath2 . 
 section [ length_n ] deals with the corresponding result for a real arrangement whose graph has a unique cycle of length @xmath16 . 
 we also generalize this result for the case of arrangements whose graphs are a union of disjoint cycles . 
 in this section , we present the computation of the fundamental group of the complement of real line arrangements . 
 this is based on the moishezon - teicher method @xcite and the van kampen theorem @xcite . 
 some more presentations and algorithms can be found in @xcite . 
 if the reader is familiar with this algorithm , he can skip this section .      to an arrangement of @xmath36 lines in @xmath14 
 one can associate a _ wiring diagram _ 
 @xcite , which holds the combinatorial data of the arrangement and the position of the intersection points . 
 a wiring diagram is a collection of @xmath36 wires ( where a _ wire _ in @xmath37 is a union of segments and rays , homeomorphic to @xmath38 ) . 
 the induced wiring diagram is constructed by choosing a new line ( called the _ guiding line _ ) , which avoids all the intersection points of the arrangement , such that the projections of intersection points do not overlap . 
 then , the @xmath36 wires are generated as follows . 
 start at the @xmath39 end of the line with @xmath36 parallel rays , and for every projection of an intersection point , make the corresponding switch in the rays , as in figure [ latowd ] .    to a wiring diagram , one can associate a list of _ lefschetz pairs_. any pair of this list corresponds to one of the intersection points , and holds the smallest and the largest indices of the wires intersected at this point , numerated locally near the intersection point ( see @xcite and @xcite ) .    for example 
 , in the wiring diagram of figure [ wdtolp ] , the list of lefschetz pairs is ( we pass on the intersection points from right to left ) : @xmath40}},{{\left[{2},{4}\right]}},{{\left[{1},{2}\right]}},{{\left[{4},{5}\right]}},{{\left[{2},{3}\right]}},{{\left[{3},{4}\right]}},{{\left[{4},{5}\right]}},{{\left[{2},{3}\right ] } } ) .\ ] ]      let @xmath41 be a closed disk in @xmath14 , @xmath42 a set of @xmath36 points , and @xmath43 . 
 let @xmath44 be the group of all diffeomorphisms @xmath45 such that @xmath46 is the identity and @xmath47 . 
 the action of such @xmath48 on the disk applies to paths in @xmath41 , which induces an automorphism on @xmath49 . 
 the _ braid group _ , @xmath50 $ ] , is the group @xmath44 modulo the subgroup of diffeomorphisms inducing the trivial automorphism on @xmath49 
 . an element of @xmath51 $ ] is called a _ 
 braid_. for simplicity , we will assume that @xmath52 , and that @xmath53 . 
 choose a point @xmath54 ( for convenience we choose it to be below the real line ) . 
 the group @xmath55 is freely generated by @xmath56 , where @xmath57 is a loop starting and ending at @xmath58 , enveloping the @xmath59th point in @xmath60 . 
 the set @xmath61 is called a _ geometric base _ or _ 
 g - base _ of @xmath55 ( see figure [ fig_1 ] ) . 
 let @xmath62}},\dots,{{\left[{a_p},{b_p}\right]}})$ ] be a list of lefschetz pairs  associated to a real line arrangement @xmath63 with @xmath36 lines . 
 the  of the complement of the arrangement is a quotient group of @xmath55 . 
 there are @xmath64 sets of relations , one for every intersection point . in each point 
 , we will compute an object called a _ skeleton _ , from which the relation is computed .    in order to compute the skeleton @xmath65 associated to the @xmath59th intersection point , we start with an _ initial skeleton _ corresponding to the @xmath59th lefshetz pair @xmath66}}$ ] which is presented in figure [ fig3 ] , in which the points correspond to the lines of the arrangement and we connect by segments adjacent points which correspond to a local numeration of lines passing through the intersection point .    0.7 cm    to the initial skeleton , we apply the lefschetz pairs @xmath67 } } , \cdots,{{\left[{a_1},{b_1}\right]}}$ ] . a lefschetz pair @xmath68}}$ ] 
 acts by rotating the region from @xmath69 to @xmath70 by @xmath71 counterclockwise without affecting any other points . 
 for example , consider the list @xmath72}},{{\left[{2},{4}\right]}},{{\left[{4},{5}\right]}},{{\left[{1},{3}\right]}},{{\left[{3},{4}\right]}})$ ] . 
 let us compute the skeleton associated to the 5th point . 
 the initial skeleton for @xmath73}}$ ] is given in figure [ fig4](a ) . by applying @xmath74}}$ ] and then @xmath75}}$ ] , we get the skeleton in figure [ fig4](b ) . 
 then , applying @xmath76}}$ ] yields the skeleton in figure [ fig4](c ) , and finally by acting with @xmath77}}$ ] we get the final skeleton in figure [ fig4](d ) . 
 4.5 cm      from the final skeletons we compute the relations , as follows . 
 we first explain the case when @xmath78}}$ ] corresponds to a simple point ,  @xmath79 . 
 then the skeleton is a path connecting two points . 
 let @xmath41 be a disk circumscribing the skeleton , and let @xmath60 be the set of points . 
 choose an arbitrary point on the path and pull it down , splitting the path into two parts , which are connected in one end to @xmath80 and in the other to the two end points of the path in @xmath60 . 
 the loops associated to these two paths are elements in the group @xmath81 , and we call them @xmath82 and @xmath83 . 
 the corresponding elements commute in the  of the arrangement s complement . 
 figure [ av_bv ] illustrates this procedure . 
 now we show how to write @xmath82 and @xmath83 as words in the generators @xmath84 of @xmath85 . 
 we start with the generator corresponding to the end point of @xmath82 ( or @xmath83 ) , and conjugate it as we move along @xmath82 ( or @xmath83 ) from its end point on @xmath60 to @xmath58 as follows : for every point @xmath86 which we pass from above , we conjugate by @xmath87 when moving from left to right , and by @xmath88 when moving from right to left . 
 for example , in figure [ av_bv ] , @xmath89 and so the induced relation is : @xmath90    one can check that the relation is independent of the point in which the path is split .    for a multiple intersection point of multiplicity @xmath91 
 , we compute the elements in the group @xmath81 in a similar way , but the induced relations are of the following type : @xmath92 we choose an arbitrary point on the path and pull it down to @xmath58 . 
 for each of the @xmath91 end points of the skeleton , we generate the loop associated to the path from @xmath58 to that point , and translate this path to a word in @xmath93 by the procedure described above . 
 in the example given in figure [ av_bv_mul ] , we have : @xmath94 , @xmath95 and @xmath96 , so the relations are @xmath97 
 in this section , we prove the following proposition :    [ triangle - prop ] the fundamental group of a real affine arrangement without parallel lines , whose graph which has a unique cycle of length @xmath2 and has no line with more than two multiple points , has a conjugation - free geometric presentation .    in the first subsection we present the proof of proposition [ triangle - prop ] 
 . the second subsection will be devoted to studying the group structure of the fundamental group of the simplest arrangement of this family .      for simplicity 
 , we will assume that all the multiple points have the same multiplicity @xmath98 , but the same argument will work even if the multiplicities are not equal .    by rotations and translations 
 , one can assume that we have a drawing of an arrangement which has a unique cycle of multiple points of length 3 and has no line with more than two multiple points , as in figure [ arrange_mult_3 ] . 
 we can assume it due to the following reasons : first , one can rotate a line that participates in only one multiple point as long as it does not unite with a different line ( by results 4.8 and 4.13 of @xcite ) . 
 second , moving a line that participates in only one multiple point over a different line ( see figure [ triangle - line ] ) is permitted in the case of a triangle due to a result of fan @xcite that the family of configurations with @xmath1 lines and three triple points is connected by a finite sequence of smooth equisingular deformations . 
 each of the blocks 1,4,5 contains simple intersection points of two pencils .    in block 1 
 , one can assume that all the intersections of any horizontal line are adjacent , without intervening points from the third pencil . in blocks 4 and 5 
 , one can assume that all the intersections of any vertical line are adjacent ( in block 4 , the vertical lines are those with positive slopes ) . 
 all the intersection points of block 5 are to the left of all the intersection points of block 4 . 
 hence , we get the list of lefschetz pairs as in table [ tab1 ] ( we put a double line to separate between the pairs related to different blocks ) .

 before we proceed to the presentation of the fundamental group , we introduce one notation : instead of writing the relations ( where @xmath22 are words in a group ) : @xmath112 we will sometimes write : @xmath113 $ ] .    by the van kampen theorem

 cohen and suciu @xcite give the following presentation of @xmath169 , which is known @xcite to be the fundamental group of the complement of the affine ceva arrangement ( see figure [ ceva ] ) : @xmath170 the actions of the automorphisms @xmath171 and @xmath172 are defined as follows :    @xmath173 + @xmath174    @xmath175 + @xmath176    @xmath177 + @xmath178    notice that if we rotate clockwise the lowest line in the affine ceva arrangement ( figure [ ceva ] ) , we get an arrangement @xmath0 whose graph consists of a unique cycle of length @xmath2 , where all the multiple points are of multiplicity @xmath2 .    by a simple check , 
 the effect of this rotation is the addition of the commutator relation @xmath179=e$ ] to the presentation of the group . 
 hence , we get that the actions of the automorphisms @xmath171 and @xmath172 are changed as follows :    @xmath173 + @xmath174    @xmath180    @xmath177 + @xmath178    this is the presentation of the group : @xmath181 , where @xmath34 is the free product . 
 to summarize , we get the following result :    let @xmath0 be the arrangement of @xmath1 lines without parallel lines whose graph is a unique cycle of length @xmath2 , where all the multiple points are of multiplicity @xmath2 . then : @xmath33    it is interesting to check how this proposition can be generalize to arrangements whose graphs are cycles of length @xmath182 . 
 in this section , we show that the fundamental group of a real affine arrangement whose graph is a unique cycle of any length and has no line with more than two multiple points , has a conjugation - free geometric presentation . at the end of this section , we generalize this result to arrangements whose graphs are unions of disjoint cycles . 
 we start by investigating the case of a cycle of length @xmath183 and then we generalize it to any length .    in figure [ cycle_multiple5 ] , we present a real arrangement whose graph is a cycle of @xmath183 multiple points ( note that any real arrangement whose graph is a unique cycle of @xmath183 multiple points and has no line with more than two multiple points , can be transferred to this drawing by rotations , translations and equisingular deformations ) .    based on figure [ cycle_multiple5 ] 
 , we get the list of lefschetz pairs presented in table [ tab2 ] .    @xmath184   & 2 & & 13 & [ 6,7 ] & 2 & & 25 & [ 8,9 ] & 2 \\ 2 & [ 5,6 ]   & 2 & & 14 & [ 7,8 ] & 2 & & 26 & [ 6,7 ] & 2 \\ 3 & [ 7,8 ]   & 2 & & 15 & [ 3,4 ] & 2 & & 27 & [ 5,6 ] & 2 \\ 4 & [ 6,7 ]   & 2 & & 16 & [ 4,5 ] & 2 & & 28 & [ 7,8 ] & 2 \\ 5 & [ 4,5 ]   & 2 & & 17 & [ 5,6 ] & 2 & & 29 & [ 6,7 ] & 2 \\ 6 & [ 3,4 ]   & 2 & & 18 & [ 6,7 ] & 2 & & 30 & [ 4,6 ] & 3 \\ 7 & [ 5,6 ]   & 2 & & 19 & [ 4,6 ] & 3 & & 31 & [ 3,4 ] & 2 \\ 8 & [ 4,5 ]   & 2 & & 20 & [ 3,4 ] & 2 & & 32 & [ 4,5 ] & 2 \\ 9 & [ 2,3 ]   & 2 & & 21 & [ 4,5 ] & 2 & & 33 & [ 2,3 ] & 2 \\ 10 & [ 1,2 ] & 2 & & 22 & [ 8,9 ] & 2 & & 34 & [ 1,2 ] & 2 \\ 11 & [ 2,4 ] & 3 & & 23 & [ 7,8 ] & 2 & & 35 & [ 2,4 ] & 3 \\ 12 & [ 4,6 ] & 3 & & 24 & [ 9,10 ] & 2 & &   &   & 
 \\ \hline\hline \end{array}\ ] ]    by the moishezon - teicher algorithm ( see section [ mt ] ) , one can compute the skeletons of the braid monodromy . 
 after the computation , one should notice that actually we can group the intersection points into blocks according to their braid monodromies ( see figure [ cycle_multiple5_block ] ) , since the structure of the skeletons is similar . 
 following this observation , we can deal with each block separately . 
 so , we get the following sets of skeletons :    * quadruples of type q1 : see figure [ quadruple_case1](a ) for @xmath185 . 
 * quadruples of type q2 : see figure [ quadruple_case2](a ) for @xmath186 , @xmath187 , @xmath188 . * a triple of type t1 : see figure [ triple_case1](a ) . 
 * triples of type t2 : see figure [ triple_case2 ] for @xmath189 . * a triple of type t3 : see figure [ triple_case3](a ) . * a triple of type t4 : see figure [ triple_case4](a ) . 
 now we pass to the general case . 
 one can draw an arrangement of @xmath190 lines whose graph is a unique cycle of length @xmath16 and has no line with more than two multiple points in a similar way to the way we have drawn the arrangement of @xmath191 lines whose graph is a cycle of length @xmath183 . 
 hence , one can compute the braid monodromy of the general arrangement in blocks similar to what we have done in the case of @xmath192 :    * quadruples of type q1 : for @xmath193 , see figure [ quadruple_case1](b ) . 
 * quadruples of type q2 : for @xmath194 , @xmath187 , @xmath195 , see figure [ quadruple_case2](b ) . * a triple of type t1 : see figure [ triple_case1](b ) . 
 * triples of type t2 : for @xmath196 , see figure [ triple_case2 ] . * 
 a triple of type t3 : see figure [ triple_case3](b ) . 
 * a triple of type t4 : see figure [ triple_case4](b ) .    by the van - kampen theorem ( see section [ mt ] ) , we get the following presentation of the fundamental group of the complement of the arrangement :    generators : @xmath197 + relations :    * from quadruples of type q1 : 1 .

 @xmath217    we now show that all the conjugations can be simplified , and hence we have a conjugation - free geometric presentation for the fundamental group . 
 we have conjugations in the relations coming from triples of points and quadruples of points . 
 we start with the relations which correspond to triples of points . 
 the conjugation in relation ( 3 ) of the triple of type t1 can be simplified using relations ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) of the triple of type t1 . 
 the conjugation in relation ( 1 ) of triples of type t2 can be simplified using relations ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) of the corresponding triples of type t2 . 
 the conjugation in relation ( 3 ) of the triple of type t3 can be simplified using relation ( 3 ) of the triple of type t4 . 
 the conjugation in relation ( 2 ) of the triple of type t3 can be simplified using relations ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) of the triple of type t4 . 
 the conjugation in relation ( 1 ) of the triple of type t3 can be simplified using relations ( 2)(3 ) of the triple of type t3 and relations ( 1)(3 ) of the triple of type t4 . 
 we continue to the relations induced by to the quadruples of type q1 . by the first two relations of the quadruples of type q1 
 , one can easily simplify the conjugations which appear in the last two relations of the quadruples of type q1 . 
 so we get that the relations correspond to the quadruples of type q1 can be written without conjugations . 
 now , we pass to the relations correspond to the quadruples of type q2 . we start with @xmath218 : we have the following relations :    1 . 
 @xmath219=e$ ] 2 . 
 @xmath220=e$ ] 3 . 
 @xmath221=e$ ] 4 . 
 @xmath222=e$ ]    by relations ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) of triple t2 ( for @xmath223 ) , we have the relations @xmath224=e$ ] and @xmath225=e$ ] . hence , the conjugations in relation ( d ) are canceled and we get @xmath226=e$ ] . by the same relations and the simplified version of relation ( d ) , we get the following relation from relation ( a ) : @xmath227=e$ ] .    substituting @xmath223 in relation ( 1 ) of triple t2 yields @xmath228 by this relation , relation ( c ) becomes @xmath229=e$ ] , and relation ( b ) becomes @xmath230=e$ ] . 
 the same argument holds for any @xmath231 , where @xmath232 and @xmath233 . 
 hence , one can simplify the conjugations in these cases . 
 now , we pass to the case where @xmath234 and @xmath233 . 
 let @xmath235 . 
 we have the following relations :    1 . 
 @xmath236=e$ ] 2 . 
 @xmath237=e$ ] 3 . 
 @xmath238=e$ ] 4 . 
 @xmath239=e$ ]    by relations ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) of triple t2 ( for @xmath223 ) , we have the relations @xmath224=e$ ] and @xmath225=e$ ] . 
 hence , relations ( a ) and ( d ) become :    1 . 
 @xmath240=e$ ] 2 . 
 @xmath241=e$ ]    by relations ( a ) and ( d ) above , we get @xmath242=e$ ] , and therefore we also get @xmath243=e$ ] . 
 substituting @xmath223 in relation ( 1 ) of triple t2 yields @xmath228 by this relation , relations ( b ) and ( c ) become :    1 . 
 @xmath244=e$ ] 2 . 
 @xmath245=e$ ]    by relations ( b ) and ( c ) above , we get @xmath246=e$ ] and hence @xmath247=e$ ] . 
 it is easy to show by a simple induction that we can simplify the conjugations for any @xmath231 , where @xmath248 and @xmath233 . 
 the remaining case is @xmath249 . 
 we start with @xmath250 . 
 we have the following relations : +    \(a ) @xmath251=e$ ] + ( b ) @xmath252=e$ ] + ( c ) @xmath253=e$ ] + ( d ) @xmath254=e$ ]    we will show that these conjugations can be simplified .    by relation ( 3 ) of triple t4 and relation ( 3 ) of triple t3 , relations ( c ) and ( d ) can be written as : + ( c ) @xmath255=e$ ] + ( d ) @xmath256=e$ ]    by relation ( 3 ) of triple t2 for @xmath257 , we have @xmath258=e$ ] , and hence relation ( c ) becomes @xmath259=e$ ] .    by relation 
 ( 1 ) of triple t2 for @xmath257 , we have : @xmath260 and then relation ( d ) becomes : @xmath261=e$ ] . 
 now , we simplify relation ( a ) . again , by relations ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) of triple t2 for @xmath257 , we have @xmath258=e$ ] and @xmath262=e$ ] , and hence : @xmath263=e\ ] ] by relation ( 3 ) of triple t4 , we have : @xmath264=e.\ ] ] by relations ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) of triple t4 , we have : @xmath265=e.\ ] ] by relations ( 1 ) of triple t3 , we finally have : @xmath266=e$ ] . 
 now , we simplify relation ( b ) . by relation 
 ( 3 ) of triple t4 , we have : @xmath267=e.\ ] ] by relations ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) of triple t4 , we get : @xmath268=e.\ ] ] by relations ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) of triple t3 , we get : @xmath269=e.\ ] ] finally , by relation ( 1 ) of triple t2 for @xmath257 , we have @xmath260 so we get : @xmath270=e$ ] .    by similar tricks 
 , one can simplify the conjugations for all the cases where @xmath249 and @xmath271 . 
 hence , we have a presentation based on the topological generators without conjugations in the relations , and hence we are done .    the above proof is based on the fact that the multiplicity of each multiple point is @xmath2 . 
 we now explain why it can be generalized to any multiplicity . in case of higher multiplicities , the quadruples from the previous case 
 will be transformed to a block of @xmath272 simple points . 
 it can be easily checked that all the conjugations can be simplified in this case . moreover 
 , the triples from the previous case will be transformed into blocks similar to the blocks we had in the case of a cycle of length @xmath2 ( see proposition [ triangle - prop ] ) , and in this case too , it can be easily checked that all the conjugations can be simplified , and hence we have shown that arrangements whose graph is a unique cycle and have no line with more than two multiple points , have a conjugation - free geometric presentation .    using the following decomposition theorem of oka and sakamoto @xcite 
 , we can generalize the result from the case of one cycle to the case of a union of disjoint cycles :    * ( oka - sakamoto ) * let @xmath273 and @xmath274 be algebraic plane curves in @xmath275 . 
 assume that the intersection @xmath276 consists of distinct @xmath277 points , where @xmath278 are the respective degrees of @xmath273 and @xmath274 . 
 then : @xmath279    hence , we have the following result :    if the graph of the arrangement @xmath0 is a union of disjoint cycles of any length and the arrangement has no line with more than two multiple points , then its fundamental group has a conjugation - free geometric presentation .

"the first step in describing the interaction between many particles is to determine their pair potential or the forces among a single pair . 
 if the governing physical equations are linear ( like for gravity or electrostatics ) , this approach yields a quantitatively reliable description of the physical system considered , based on the linear superposition principle . 
 however , if nonlinearities are present , linear superposition of pair potentials is no longer accurate and nonadditivity gives rise to many - body effects . 
 these latter effects can lead , e.g. , to a strengthening or weakening of the total force acting on a particle surrounded by more than a single other one , a change of sign of that force , or the appearance of stable or unstable configurations . 
 many - body effects appear in rather diverse systems such as nuclear matter  , superconductivity  @xcite , colloidal suspensions  @xcite , quantum - electrodynamic casimir forces  @xcite , polymers  @xcite , nematic colloids  @xcite , and noble gases with van der waals forces acting among them  @xcite . each of these systems is characterized by a wide range of time and length scales . integrating out the degrees of freedom associated with small scales ( such as the solvent of colloidal solutes or polymers ) for fixed configurations of the large particles , generates effective interactions among the latter , which are inherently not pairwise additive . 
 this is the price to be paid for achieving a reduced description of a multicomponent system . driven by these effective interactions the large particles of the system may exhibit collective behavior of their own ( like aggregation or phase separation , see refs . 
 @xcite and  @xcite and references therein ) , which can be described much easier if it is governed by pair potentials . in order to be able to judge whether this ansatz is adequate 
 one has to check the relative magnitude of genuine many - body forces .    in this paper 
 we assess the quantitative influence of such many - body effects on critical casimir forces ( ccfs )  @xcite . 
 these long - ranged forces arise as a consequence of the confinement of the order parameter fluctuations in a critical fluid  @xcite . 
 they have been analyzed paradigmatically by studying the effective interaction between a _ 
 single _ colloidal particle and a homogeneous  @xcite or inhomogeneous  @xcite container wall as well as between _ two isolated _ colloidal particles  @xcite upon approaching the critical point of the solvent . here 
 we add one sphere to the sphere - wall configuration , which is the simplest possibility to study many - body forces . 
 ( the wall mimics a third , very large sphere . )    in order to be able to identify the latter ones one has to resort to a theoretical scheme which allows one to compute the forces between individual pairs and the three - body forces on the same footing . 
 since these forces are characterized by universal scaling functions , which depend on the various geometrical features of the configuration and on the thermodynamic state , we tackle this task by resorting to field - theoretic mean field theory ( mft ) , which captures the universal scaling functions as the leading contribution to their systematic expansion in terms of @xmath1 spatial dimensions . 
 experience with corresponding previous studies for simple geometries tells that this approach does yield the relevant qualitative features of the actual universal scaling functions in @xmath2 ; if suitably enhanced by renormalization group arguments these results reach a semi - quantitative status . 
 we point out that even within this approximation the numerical implementation of this corresponding scheme poses a severe technical challenge . 
 thus at present this approach appears to be the only feasible one to explore the role of many - body critical casimir forces within the full range of their scaling variables . 
 accordingly we consider the standard landau - ginzburg - wilson hamiltonian for critical phenomena of the ising bulk universality class , which is given by    @xmath3 = \int_v{\rm d}^d\mathbf{r } \left\ { \frac{1}{2}\left ( \nabla\phi \right)^2 + \frac{\tau}{2}\phi^2 + \frac{u}{4!}\phi^4 \right\ } ~,\ ] ]    with suitable boundary conditions ( bcs ) . in the case of a binary liquid mixture near its consolute ( demixing ) point , the order parameter @xmath4 is proportional to the deviation of the local concentration of one of the two species from the critical concentration . 
 @xmath5 is the volume accessible to the fluid , @xmath6 is proportional to the reduced temperature @xmath7 , and the coupling constant @xmath8 stabilizes the statistical weight @xmath9 in the two - phase region , i.e. , for @xmath10 . 
 close to the bulk critical point @xmath11 the bulk correlation length @xmath12 diverges as @xmath13 , where @xmath14 in @xmath2 and @xmath15 in @xmath16 , i.e. , within mft  @xcite . 
 the two non - universal amplitudes @xmath17 are of molecular size ; they form the universal ratio @xmath18 for @xmath2 and @xmath19 for @xmath16  @xcite . 
 the bcs reflect the generic adsorption preference of the confining surfaces for one of the two components of the mixture . for the critical adsorption fixed point  @xcite , 
 the bc at each of the confining surfaces is either @xmath20 or @xmath21 , to which we refer as @xmath22 or @xmath23 , respectively .    within mft 
 the equilibrium order parameter distribution minimizes the hamiltonian in eq .   for the aforementioned bcs , 
 i.e. , @xmath24/\delta\phi = 0 $ ] . 
 far from any boundary the order parameter approaches its constant bulk value @xmath25 for @xmath10 or @xmath26 for @xmath27 . 
 @xmath28 is a non - universal bulk amplitude and @xmath29 ( for @xmath16 ) is a standard critical exponent . in the following we consider the reduced order parameter @xmath30 . 
 the remainder of this paper is organized as follows . in sec . 
 [ section_the_system ] we define the system under consideration and the scaling functions for the ccfs as well as the normalization scheme . in sec . 
 [ section_results ] we present the numerical results obtained for the universal scaling functions of the ccfs , from which we extract and analyze the many - body effects . in sec . 
 [ section_conclusion ] we summarize our results and draw some conclusions . 
 we study the normal and the lateral ccfs acting on two colloidal particles immersed in a near - critical binary liquid mixture and close to a homogeneous , planar substrate . 
 we focus on the critical concentration which implies the absence of a bulk field conjugate to the order parameter [ see eq .  ] . 
 the surfaces of the colloids and of the substrate are considered to exhibit a strong adsorption preference for one of the two components of the confined liquid leading to @xmath31 bcs . 
 the forces are calculated using the full three - dimensional numerical analysis of the appropriate mft as given by eq .  . 
 specifically , we consider two three - dimensional spheres of radii @xmath32 and @xmath33 with bcs @xmath34 and ( @xmath35 ) , respectively , facing a homogeneous substrate with bc @xmath36 at sphere - surface - to - substrate distances @xmath37 and @xmath38 , respectively ( see fig .  [ system_sketch ] ) . 
 the coordinate system @xmath39 is chosen such that the centers of the spheres are located at @xmath40 and @xmath41 so that the distance between the centers , projected onto the @xmath42-axis , is given by @xmath43 . 
 the bcs of the whole system are represented by the set @xmath44 , where @xmath45 , @xmath35 , and @xmath46 can be either @xmath47 or @xmath48 . 
 it is important to point out that we discuss colloidal particles with the shape of a hypercylinder    @xmath49    where @xmath50 are the semiaxes ( or radii ) of the hypercylinder and @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 . 
 if @xmath54 and @xmath55 , the hypercylinder reduces to a hypersphere . 
 the generalization of @xmath56 to values larger than 3 is introduced for technical reasons because @xmath57 is the upper critical dimension for the relevance of the fluctuations of the order parameter . 
 these fluctuations lead to a behavior different from that obtained from the present mft which ( apart from logarithmic corrections  @xcite ) is valid in @xmath16 . 
 we consider two hypercylinders in @xmath16 with @xmath58 and @xmath59 . 
 the two colloids are taken to be parallel along the fourth dimension with infinitely long hyperaxes in this direction . 
 considering hypercylinders , which are translationally invariant along the @xmath60axis , allows us to minimize @xmath61 $ ] numerically using a three dimensional finite element method in order to obtain the spatially inhomogeneous order parameter profile @xmath62 for the geometries under consideration ( see fig . 
 [ system_sketch ] ) . 
 and @xmath33 immersed in a near - critical binary liquid mixture ( not shown ) and close to a homogeneous , planar substrate at @xmath63 . 
 the two colloidal particles with bcs @xmath34 and @xmath64 are located at sphere - surface - to - substrate distances @xmath37 and @xmath38 , respectively . 
 the substrate exhibits bc @xmath36 . 
 the lateral distance between the centers of the spheres along the @xmath42-direction is given by @xmath43 , while the centers of both spheres lie in the plane @xmath65 . 
 in the case of four spatial dimensions the figure shows a cut of the system , which is invariant along the fourth direction , i.e. , the spheres correspond to parallel hypercylinders with one translationally invariant direction , which is @xmath66 . ]    in the case of an upper critical demixing point of the binary liquid mixture at the critical concentration , @xmath67 corresponds to the disordered ( i.e. , mixed ) phase of the fluid , whereas @xmath68 corresponds to the ordered ( i.e. , phase separated ) phase . 
 the meaning of the sign is reversed for a lower critical point . in the following we assume an upper critical point . 
 the normal ccf @xmath69 acting on sphere @xmath70 in the presence of sphere @xmath71 ( @xmath72 and @xmath73 ) along the @xmath74-direction takes the scaling form    @xmath75    where @xmath76 , @xmath77 , @xmath78 , @xmath79 , and @xmath80 ( i.e. , @xmath81 for @xmath27 and @xmath82 for @xmath10 ) . 
 equation describes the singular contribution to the normal force emerging upon approaching @xmath11 . 
 @xmath83 is the force per length of the hypercylinder due to its extension in the translationally invariant direction . in the spirit of a systematic expansion in terms of @xmath84 around the upper critical dimension we study the scaling functions @xmath85 within mft as given by eq .   for hypercylinders in @xmath16 , which captures the correct scaling functions in @xmath16 up to logarithmic corrections occurring in @xmath86  @xcite , which we do not take into account here . 
 since mft renders the leading contribution to an expansion around @xmath16 , geometrical configurations with small @xmath87 , @xmath88 , or @xmath89 are not expected to be described reliably by the present approach due to the dimensional crossover in narrow slit - like regions , which is not captured by the @xmath84 expansion . 
 the colloidal particles will also experience a lateral ccf @xmath90 , for which it is convenient to use the scaling form    @xmath91    where @xmath92 ( i.e. , @xmath93 for @xmath27 and @xmath94 for @xmath10 ) . 
 note that the choice of @xmath95 as the scaling variable does not depend on the type of particle the force acts on . 
 equation also describes the singular contribution to the lateral force near @xmath11 . 
 the total ccf acting on particle @xmath70 is    @xmath96    where @xmath97 and @xmath98 are the unit vectors pointing in @xmath42- and @xmath74-direction , respectively . 
 due to symmetry all other components of the ccf are zero .    as a reference configuration 
 we consider a single spherical colloid of radius @xmath99 with bc @xmath100 at a surface - to - surface distance @xmath101 from a planar substrate with bc @xmath36 . 
 this colloid experiences ( only ) a normal ccf    @xmath102    in the following we normalize the scaling functions @xmath103 and @xmath104 by the amplitude @xmath105 of the ccf acting at @xmath11 on a single colloid for @xmath106 bcs at a surface - to - surface distance @xmath107 . accordingly , in the following we consider the normalized scaling functions    @xmath108    with @xmath109 and @xmath110 . experimentally it can be rather difficult to obtain @xmath105 . 
 a standard alternative way to normalize is to take the more easily accessible amplitude @xmath111 for the ccf at @xmath11 between two parallel plates with @xmath106 bcs , which is given within mft by ( see ref . 
 @xcite and references therein )    @xmath112 ^ 4}{u } \simeq -283.61 u^{-1 } ~,\ ] ]    where @xmath113 is the elliptic integral of the first kind . within mft 
 the amplitude @xmath105 can be expressed in terms of @xmath111 :    @xmath114    equation allows for a practical implementation of the aforementioned normalization , which eliminates the coupling constant @xmath115 , which is unknown within mft . 
 we calculate the normal and lateral forces directly from the numerically determined order parameter profiles @xmath62 by using the stress tensor which , within the ginzburg - landau approach , is given by  @xcite    @xmath116 ~,\ ] ]    with @xmath117 . 
 the first index of the stress tensor denotes the direction of a force , the second index denotes the direction of the normal vector of the surface upon which the force acts . 
 therefore one has    @xmath118    where @xmath119 is a hypersurface enclosing particle @xmath70 , @xmath120 is the @xmath121-th component ( to be summed over ) of its unit outward normal , and @xmath122 is the length of the @xmath123-dimensional hyperaxis of @xmath124 . 
 in particular we focus on the normal and lateral ccfs acting on colloid ( 2 ) for the configuration shown in fig . 
 [ system_sketch ] , for @xmath125 , and with the binary liquid mixture at its critical concentration . in the following analysis 
 we consider colloid ( 1 ) to be fixed in space at a sphere - surface - to - substrate distance @xmath126 , equally sized colloids ( i.e. , @xmath127 ) , and fixed @xmath128 bc for the substrate . 
 we proceed by varying either the vertical ( @xmath74-direction ) or the horizontal ( @xmath42-direction ) position of colloid ( 2 ) by varying either @xmath38 or @xmath129 , respectively . 
 we also consider different sets of bcs for the colloids . in the following results the numerical error is typically less than @xmath130 , unless explicitly stated otherwise . 
 in fig .  [ d2_z ] 
 we show the behavior of the normalized [ eq .  ] scaling function @xmath131 of the normal ccf acting on colloid ( 2 ) with @xmath132 bcs close to a homogeneous substrate with @xmath128 bc and in the presence of colloid ( 1 ) with @xmath133 bc . 
 the scaling functions are shown as functions of the scaling variable ratio @xmath134 , i.e. , for @xmath27 . 
 the various lines correspond to distinct fixed values of @xmath135 as the sphere - surface - to - substrate distance in units of the sphere radius . 
 thus fig . 
 [ d2_z ] shows the temperature dependence of the normal ccf on colloid 2 for three different values of @xmath38 and for colloid ( 1 ) fixed in space .    from fig . 
 [ d2_z ] ( a ) one can see that , for colloid ( 1 ) with @xmath136 bc and for any given value of @xmath137 , the scaling function of the normal ccf acting on colloid ( 2 ) with @xmath138 bc changes sign upon varying @xmath135 . due to the change of sign of @xmath139 , for any value of @xmath137 
 there is a certain value @xmath140 at which the normal ccf acting on colloid ( 2 ) vanishes . for sphere - surface - to - substrate distances sufficiently large such that @xmath141 , colloid ( 2 ) is pushed away from the substrate due to the dominating repulsion between the two colloids in spite of the attraction by the substrate , whereas for @xmath142 it is pulled to the substrate due to the dominating attraction between it and the substrate 
 this implies that , in the absence of additional forces , levitation of colloid ( 2 ) ( i.e. , zero total normal force ) at height @xmath143 is not stable against perturbations of the sphere - surface - to - substrate distance . on the other hand , upon varying temperature , 
 any distance @xmath38 can become a stable levitation position for colloid ( 2 ) with @xmath144 bc in the presence of colloid ( 1 ) with @xmath133 bc [ see fig . 
 [ d2_z ] ( b ) , according to which each scaling function corresponding to a certain value of @xmath38 exhibits a zero so that , at this zero , increasing ( decreasing ) @xmath38 at fixed temperature leads to an attraction ( repulsion ) to ( from ) the substrate ] . in this case 
 the attraction between the two colloids is dominating for large sphere - surface - to - substrate distances @xmath135 , while the repulsion between colloid ( 2 ) and the substrate dominates for small values of @xmath135 .     of the normal ccf acting on colloid ( 2 ) with bcs @xmath145 in ( a ) and @xmath144 in ( b ) . 
 the scaling functions are shown for @xmath27 as functions of the scaling variable ratio @xmath146 for three fixed values of the scaling variable @xmath77 : @xmath147 ( black lines ) , 1.5 ( red lines ) , and 2 ( green lines ) , while @xmath148 for all curves in ( a ) and ( b ) so that @xmath149 . for @xmath33 fixed the three curves correspond to three different vertical positions of colloid ( 2 ) with colloid ( 1 ) fixed in space . 
 as expected , the forces become overall weaker upon increasing @xmath135 . 
 @xmath150 @xmath151 implies that the colloid is attracted to ( repelled from ) the substrate along the @xmath74-direction . ] 
 figure  [ d2_x ] shows the behavior of the normalized scaling function @xmath152 of the lateral ccf acting on colloid ( 2 ) in the presence of colloid ( 1 ) having the same bc , i.e. , @xmath153 . 
 the scaling functions are shown as functions of the scaling variable ratio @xmath154 . from figs . 
 [ d2_x ] ( a ) and ( b ) one can infer that @xmath155 . 
 therefore colloid ( 2 ) is always attracted towards colloid ( 1 ) which has the same bc . 
 hence the substrate does not change the sign of the lateral ccf as compared with the attractive lateral ccf in the absence of the confining substrate . 
 however , the shapes of the scaling functions for @xmath156 bcs [ fig .  [ d2_x ] ( a ) ] differ from the ones for @xmath157 bcs [ fig . 
 [ d2_x ] ( b ) ] ; without the substrate , they are identical . in the former case and in contrast to the latter one , the scaling functions exhibit minima above @xmath11 , which is reminiscent of the shape of the corresponding scaling functions in the absence of the substrate .     of the lateral ccf acting on colloid ( 2 ) facing a homogeneous substrate with @xmath128 bc and in the presence of colloid ( 1 ) with @xmath158 bcs . 
 the scaling functions are shown for @xmath27 as functions of the scaling variable ratio @xmath154 for three fixed values of the scaling variable @xmath77 : @xmath147 ( black curves ) , 1.5 ( red curves ) , and 2 ( green curves ) , while @xmath148 for all curves in ( a ) and ( b ) so that @xmath149 . for @xmath33 fixed the three curves correspond to three different vertical positions of colloid ( 2 ) with colloid ( 1 ) fixed in space . 
 as expected , the forces become overall weaker upon increasing @xmath135 . 
 @xmath159 implies that colloid ( 2 ) is attracted towards colloid ( 1 ) . 
 two different sets of @xmath160 bcs are considered : @xmath156 in ( a ) and @xmath157 in ( b ) . ]    in fig . 
 [ l_x ] we show the results obtained for the normalized scaling functions @xmath161 of the lateral ccf acting on colloid ( 2 ) . in fig . 
 [ l_x](a ) the scaling function is shown as function of the scaling variable ratio @xmath154 ; the black , red , and green curves correspond to @xmath162 , @xmath163 , and @xmath164 , respectively . in the absence of the substrate , 
 the ccf between two colloids with opposite bcs is repulsive . 
 however , as shown in fig . 
 [ l_x](a ) , in the presence of the substrate with @xmath128 bc , there is a change of sign in the scaling function of the lateral ccf . 
 this implies that the lateral ccf acting between the two colloids changes from being attractive to being repulsive ( or reverse ) upon decreasing ( increasing ) the reduced temperature . 
 thus temperature allows one to control both the strength and the sign of the lateral ccf in the case of two colloids with opposite bcs being near a wall . 
 the at first sight unexpected lateral attraction between two colloids with opposite bcs in the presence of the substrate ( i.e. , @xmath165 ) can be understood as follows . in the absence of the two colloids , the order parameter profile 
 @xmath166 is constant along any path within a plane @xmath167 because in this case @xmath168 . 
 since the substrate area is much larger than the surface areas of the colloids , one can regard the immersion of these colloidal spheres as a perturbation of this profile . in figs . 
 [ l_x](a ) and ( b ) , the region within which the scaling function is negative ( corresponding to an attractive force ) indicates that under these circumstances [ i.e. , when the colloids are sufficiently away from each other ; see fig . 
 [ l_x](b ) ] the perturbation generated by the presence of the spheres decreases upon decreasing the lateral distance between them . 
 this causes the colloids to move towards each other in order to weaken the perturbation by reducing its spatial extension ; this amounts to an attraction , i.e. , @xmath165 . on the other hand , when they are sufficiently close to each other the pairwise interaction between the two colloids dominates and the total lateral ccf is positive ( i.e. , repulsive ) . in fig . 
 [ l_x](c ) we show how the equilibrium lateral distance @xmath169 measured in units of @xmath170 varies as function of temperature , i.e. , @xmath170 for fixed @xmath99 .     of the lateral ccf acting on colloid ( 2 ) .

 the four data points are connected by straight lines.,title=""fig : "" ]    in order to determine the preferred arrangement of the colloids , we have also analyzed the direction of the total ccf @xmath180 acting on colloid ( 2 ) [ see eq .  ] for several spatial configurations and bcs . for @xmath156 bcs 
 we have found that the colloids tend to aggregate laterally in such a way that several particles with @xmath22 bc , facing a substrate with the same bc , can be expected to form a monolayer on the substrate . on the other hand , for the case of @xmath157 bcs 
 , we have found that the colloids can be expected to aggregate on top of each other so that a collection of colloids with such bcs is expected to form three - dimensional sessile clusters . 
 these tendencies become more pronounced upon approaching the critical point ( see fig . 
 [ direction_resulting_force_d2 ] ) . 
 similar results have been found by soyka et al . 
 @xcite in experiments using chemically patterned substrates . for them 
 the authors have found indeed that colloids with @xmath23 bc distributed over those parts of the substrate with the same bc [ which is equivalent to @xmath156 bcs ] aggregate and form a single layer . moreover , they have found that colloids distributed over parts of the substrate with opposite bc [ corresponding to @xmath157 bcs ] form three - dimensional clusters . 
 and @xmath157 bcs , with @xmath181 . 
 the black rectangles represent the substrate and blue circles represent colloid ( 1 ) while black , red , and green circles represent colloid ( 2 ) with @xmath182 , and 2 , respectively . 
 the centers of all colloids lie in the plane @xmath65 . ] 
 we have determined the many - body force acting on particle @xmath183 by subtracting from the total force @xmath184 [ see eq .  ] 
 the sum of the pairwise forces acting on it , i.e. , the colloid - colloid ( cc ) and the colloid - substrate ( cs ) forces . 
 accordingly the many - body ccf @xmath185 acting on colloid ( @xmath70 ) is given by ( see fig .  [ system_sketch ] )    @xmath186    where    @xmath187    with    @xmath188    is the pairwise colloid - colloid force ( acting on colloid 2 @xmath23 or 1 @xmath22 with 2 having the larger @xmath42-coordinate ) expressed in terms of the absolute value @xmath189 of the force between two colloids at surface - to - surface distance @xmath190 in free space . 
 @xmath191 is the ccf between the substrate and a single colloid @xmath183 . 
 we have studied both the normal    @xmath192    and the lateral    @xmath193    many - body ccfs which are characterized by corresponding scaling functions [ compare eqs .   and ] :    @xmath194    and    @xmath195    in fig . 
 [ mb_l_z ] we show the normalized [ see eqs .   and ] scaling functions @xmath196 of the many - body normal ccf acting on colloid ( 2 ) . 
 this figure reveals similar results for @xmath156 [ fig . 
 [ mb_l_z ] ( a ) ] and @xmath197 [ fig .  [ mb_l_z ] ( b ) ] bcs . in these cases , 
 each mb scaling function exhibits both a maximum and at least one minimum , the former one appearing for smaller values of the scaling variable @xmath198 ( i.e. , at temperatures closer to @xmath11 ) . for a certain range of temperatures close to @xmath11 , as the distance @xmath129 between the colloids increases , the many - body normal ccf changes from attractive to repulsive . 
 this shows that for each temperature within this range there is a lateral distance @xmath199 for which the many - body contribution to the normal force acting on colloid ( 2 ) is zero . 
 this means that under such conditions the sum of pairwise forces provides a quantitatively reliable description of the total force acting on colloid ( 2 ) . for temperatures sufficiently far from @xmath11 , the many - body normal ccf is always attractive with a monotonic dependence on @xmath198 . here , as in figs . 
 [ d2_z ] - [ l_x ] , the ccfs decay exponentially for @xmath200 . 
 as expected , the many - body effects are more pronounced if the colloids are closer to each other and/or closer to the substrate . 
 indeed for situations in which the colloids are close to each other [ see , e.g. , the black curves in figs . 
 [ mb_l_z ] ( a ) and ( b ) ] we have found that when the normal many - body ccf reaches its maximal strength , corresponding to the minimum of the scaling function @xmath201 at @xmath202 , the relative contribution of the many - body ccf reaches @xmath0 of the strength of the total normal ccf . for larger distances between the colloids [ see , e.g. , the green curves in figs 
 .  [ mb_l_z ] ( a ) and ( b ) ] this relative contribution is smaller ( around @xmath203 for @xmath204 and @xmath205 for @xmath206 ) .     of the many - body normal ccf acting on colloid ( 2 ) for @xmath207 and @xmath208 . 
 the scaling functions are shown as functions of the scaling variable ratio @xmath209 for the sets of bcs @xmath156 in ( a ) and @xmath197 in ( b ) . 
 the black , red , and green lines correspond to @xmath210 , and @xmath211 , respectively . 
 figures [ d2_z](a ) and [ mb_l_z](b ) allow a direct comparison between the full ccf and the corresponding many - body contribution ( note the different scales of the ordinates . ) ]    we are not aware of results for the quantum - electrodynamic casimir interactions which are obtained along the same lines as our ccf analysis above . 
 nonetheless , in order to assess the significance of our results we compare them with the results in ref . 
 @xcite , which is the closest comparable study which we have found in the literature . 
 therein the authors study theoretically two dielectric spheres immersed in ethanol while facing a plate . depending on the kind of fluid and on the materials of the spheres and of the plate as well as on the distances involved , 
 also the quantum - electrodynamic casimir force can be either attractive or repulsive . 
 it is well known  @xcite that for two parallel plates with permittivities @xmath212 and @xmath213 separated by a fluid with permittivity @xmath214 and without further boundaries , the quantum - electrodynamic casimir force is repulsive if @xmath215 within a suitable frequency range . in ref .  @xcite it is stated that this also holds for two spheres immersed in a fluid . 
 the authors of ref . 
 @xcite analyze the effect of nonadditivity for the above system by studying the influence of an additional , adjacent substrate on the equilibrium separation @xmath56 between two nanometer size dielectric spheres . 
 to this end , they consider two spheres of different materials with the same radii @xmath207 and the same surface - to - plate distances @xmath216 and analyze how the lateral equilibrium distance @xmath217 between the spheres depends on @xmath101 . by comparing the equilibrium distance @xmath217 with that in the absence of the substrate , @xmath218 
 , they find that @xmath217 increases or decreases ( depending on the kind of materials of the spheres ) by as much as @xmath219 as the distance from the plate varies between @xmath220 and @xmath221 . 
 they also find that `` the sphere - plate interaction changes the sphere - sphere interaction with the same sign as @xmath101 becomes smaller '' , which means that if the sphere - plate force is repulsive ( attractive ) , the sphere - sphere one will become more repulsive ( attractive ) upon decreasing the distance from the plate @xmath101 . by construction 
 these changes are genuine many - body contributions . in the case of two chemically different spheres , the sign of the many - body force contribution ( i.e. , whether it is attractive or repulsive ) agrees with the sign of the stronger one of the two individual sphere - plate interactions .    in fig . 
 [ comparing ] we show schematically the system considered in ref . 
 @xcite [ ( a ) and ( b ) ] and the system considered here [ ( c ) , ( d ) , and ( e ) ] . for the quantum - electrodynamic casimir effect , 
 the dielectric spheres are represented by circles of equal radii , with the green one corresponding to a polystyrene sphere and the red one to a silicon sphere . 
 the semi - infinite plates are represented by gray and yellow rectangles for teflon and gold , respectively . 
 the whole configuration is immersed in ethanol which , for simplicity , is not shown in the figure . 
 the dashed arrows indicate the direction of the strongest of the two pairwise sphere - substrate forces , while the solid arrows indicate the direction of the lateral many - body force . 
 the directions of the arrows in figs . 
 [ comparing ] ( a ) and ( b ) are chosen as to illustrate the findings in ref . 
 @xcite , according to which the sign of the _ lateral _ many - body force is the same as the one of the strongest _ normal _ pairwise sphere - plate force : attractive in ( a ) and repulsive in ( b ) . 
 also in the case of the critical casimir forces , depicted in figs .  [ comparing ] ( c ) , ( d ) , and ( e ) , 
 we represent the colloids by circles and the laterally homogeneous semi - infinite substrate by rectangles . 
 the orange filling represents the @xmath22 bc while the blue filling represents the @xmath23 bc . 
 again , the dashed arrows indicate the direction of the stronger one of the two pairwise ( normal ) colloid - substrate forces , while the solid arrows indicate the direction of the lateral many - body contribution to the ccf . as one can infer from fig . 
 [ mb_x ] , the _ lateral _ many - body ccf acting on colloid ( 2 ) is always attractive for the given geometrical configuration , regardless of the bcs .     and alluding to the system 
 studied in ref . 
 @xcite , the circles represent the projections of dielectric spheres with equal radii , the green one corresponding to polystyrene and the red one to silicon ; the rectangles represent semi - infinite plates with their surfaces perpendicular to the @xmath222 plane , the gray and the yellow one being teflon and gold , respectively . 
 the system is immersed in ethanol , which is not indicated in the figure . in ( a ) and ( b ) 
 each dashed arrow indicates the direction of the stronger one of the two corresponding pairwise forces between the dielectric spheres and the plate , which turns out to determine the direction of the many - body lateral force acting on the spheres : if the stronger one of the two pairwise forces is attractive [ repulsive ] , the lateral many - body force will also be attractive [ repulsive ] ( see ref . 
 also in the case of the critical casimir interaction [ ( c ) , ( d ) , and ( e ) ] , the circles and rectangles represent projections of spherical colloids and of homogeneous substrates , respectively : orange and blue indicate @xmath22 and @xmath23 bcs , respectively . in ( c ) and 
 ( d ) the pairwise normal forces between each of the two spheres and the substrate are equal : attractive in ( c ) and repulsive in ( d ) . in ( e ) the two pairwise 
 normal forces have opposite directions with the repulsive one being the stronger one  @xcite . 
 the corresponding dashed arrows have the same meaning as in ( a ) and ( b ) . according to fig . 
 [ mb_x ] the many - body lateral ccfs are attractive for all three cases ( c ) , ( d ) , and ( e ) . 
 the comparison shows that the systems in ( a ) and ( c ) behave similarly . 
 however , the behavior of system ( b ) has no counterpart for ccfs [ see ( d ) and ( e ) ] . in this figure 
 all surface - to - surface distances equal the sphere radius , which in our notation corresponds to @xmath223 . ] 
 we can also compare our results with those for two atoms close to the surface of a planar solid body . 
 mclachlan  @xcite has tackled this problem by treating the solid as a uniform dielectric . by using the image method he derived an expression for the many - body corrections to the pairwise interaction energies , i.e. , the atom - atom ( london ) and the atom - surface energies , in order to obtain the total interaction energy between the two atoms close to the surface . 
 qualitatively , he found that the leading contribution of the many - body correction leads to a repulsion if the atoms are side by side , i.e. , at equal surface - to - substrate distances . 
 rauber et al . 
 @xcite used mclachlan s approach to study the electrodynamic screening of the van der waals interaction between adsorbed atoms and molecules and a substrate . 
 the latter plays a role which is `` analogous to that of the third body in the three - body interaction between two particles embedded in a three - dimensional medium '' . 
 the van der waals interaction between the two atoms at equal distances from the substrate is altered by the presence of the solid substrate and this perturbation is given by  @xcite    @xmath224    where @xmath225 is the distance between the atoms , @xmath121 is the height above the image plane , which is the same for both atoms , and @xmath226 . 
 the coefficients are given by    @xmath227    and    @xmath228    with    @xmath229 / \left [ \epsilon(i\zeta ) + 1 \right ] ~,\ ] ]    where @xmath230 is an imaginary frequency , @xmath231 is the polarizability of the atoms ( with the dimension of a volume ) , and @xmath232 is the dielectric function of the solid ( i.e. , the substrate ) . the lateral force due to the perturbation potential given by eq .  , 
 which is the analogue of the many - body contribution to the lateral ccf , follows from differentiating @xmath233 with respect to @xmath225 :    @xmath234 ~.\end{gathered}\ ] ]    in figure  [ mclachan_fig ] we plot the lateral force given by eq .   as function of the distance @xmath225 between the two atoms for several ( equal ) distances @xmath121 above the substrate . 
 we use the values provided in ref . 
 @xcite for the coefficients @xmath235 and @xmath236 : @xmath237 ev@xmath238()@xmath239 and @xmath240 ev@xmath238()@xmath239 , which correspond to ne , and @xmath241 ev@xmath238()@xmath239 and @xmath242 ev@xmath238()@xmath239 , which correspond to ar . as one can infer from fig . 
 [ mclachan_fig ] , the many - body contribution to the lateral van der waals force is always repulsive and , as the two atoms approach the substrate , its strength increases . on the other hand , in the case of the many - body contribution to the lateral ccf , we have found that it is attractive for all bcs considered , if the surface - to - surface distances between the spheres and the sphere - surface - to - substrate distances are equal to each other and to the radius of the spheres ( see fig .  [ mb_x ] ) . 
 further , we can _ quantitatively _ compare our results with those from refs . 
 @xcite and  @xcite . to this end 
 , we assign values to the geometrical parameters characterizing the configuration of the two atoms close to the substrate and compare the results of refs . 
 @xcite and  @xcite with those for similar configurations in our model . 
 for example , estimating the many - body contribution to the lateral van der waals force for a configuration of two atoms close to a substrate corresponding to the configuration associated with the black curve   the black curve corresponds to a function of temperature but there is no temperature dependence of the van der waals force between the atoms . 
 therefore the comparison has to be carried out by choosing a certain value of @xmath243 . in fig . 
 [ mb_x ] ( i.e. , @xmath244 in the case of the ccf and @xmath245 in the case of the two atoms ) , one obtains from eq .   a value for the relative contribution of the many - body force to the lateral force which corresponds to ca . 
 this is comparable with the relative contribution of the many - body force to the lateral ccf sufficiently close to @xmath11 , although in the case of the van der waals force it is repulsive ( fig . 
 [ mclachan_fig ] ) while in the case of the ccf ( fig . 
 [ mb_x ] ) it is attractive .    considering the decay of the many - body contribution to the normal ccf as function of the surface - to - surface distance @xmath129 between the spheres ( for @xmath216 ) , we can compare the corresponding decay of the normal many - body force @xmath246 given by the potential @xmath233 in eq .  . 
 for small separations @xmath225 between the atoms the many - body contribution to the normal van der waals force increases as @xmath247 , while for large separations it decays as @xmath248 . by analyzing the data shown in fig . 
 [ mb_l_z ] one finds that for @xmath249 the scaling function of the many - body contribution to the normal ccf decays slower than @xmath250 . 
 this means that in this temperature regime the many - body contribution to the normal ccf is much more long ranged than the corresponding contribution to the normal van der waals force in the case of two atoms close to a surface . for fixed @xmath225 the many - body contribution to the lateral van der waals force decays as @xmath251 upon increasing the distance of both atoms from the substrate whereas the normal force on a single atom decays as @xmath252 .    as a final remark we point out that we have not found a completely stable configuration for the two colloids ( fig . 
 [ system_sketch ] ) : whenever there is a stable position in the horizontal ( vertical ) direction , the force is nonzero in the vertical ( horizontal ) direction . 
 for example , consider a vertical path with @xmath253 in figs . 
 [ d2_z](b ) and [ d2_x](b ) . from the first one 
 can see that along this path the normal ccf changes from being repulsive to being attractive as the sphere - surface - to - substrate distance for colloid ( 2 ) is increased , implying that there is a vertical position of colloid ( 2 ) in which the normal ccf is zero . 
 however , according to fig . 
 [ d2_x](b ) the lateral ccf is always attractive regardless of the vertical position of colloid ( 2 ) . 
 this means that there is a configuration which is stable only in the normal direction . 
 accordingly , a dumbbell configuration with a rigid thin fiber between the two colloids can levitate over the substrate . 
 whether this configuration is stable with respect to a vertical tilt remains as an open question .     of the lateral many - body ccf acting on colloid ( 2 ) for @xmath207 and @xmath254 . 
 the scaling function is shown as function of the scaling variable ratio @xmath255 . 
 the black , red , and green lines correspond to the bcs @xmath157 , @xmath197 , and @xmath156 , respectively . 
 for all three bcs the many - body contribution is not monotonic as function of temperature . 
 quantitatively the green , red , and black curves here should be compared with the black curves in figs . 
 [ d2_x](a ) , [ d2_x](b ) , and [ l_x](a ) , respectively . 
 however , for the data shown in _ this _ figure the error bars ( not shown ) due to limits of the numerical accuracy are between 10@xmath256 and 15@xmath256 . 
 this is the main reason why we refrain from showing what would be an instructive plot such as @xmath257 as a function of @xmath258 for various values of @xmath259 and @xmath170 ( as we did in fig . 
 [ l_x ] ) , which would allow for a direct comparison with the case of atoms . ]    , derived from the expression for the excess potential given in refs . 
 @xcite and  @xcite [ eq .  ] . 
 the forces are plotted as functions of the lateral separation @xmath225 between the two atoms for several equal vertical distances @xmath121 of the atoms from the substrate . 
 the curves correspond to two sets of values for the coefficients @xmath235 and @xmath236 in eq . 
 @xcite , corresponding to ne ( solid lines ) and ar ( dashed lines ) . ] 
 we now turn our attention to the case in which the colloids are vertically aligned with respect to a planar , homogeneous substrate , i.e. , when their centers have the same coordinates in both the @xmath42 and the @xmath260 direction ( see fig .  [ vertical_sketch ] ) . 
 we focus on the normal ccf acting on colloid ( 1 ) when the system is immersed in a near - critical binary liquid mixture at its critical concentration . as before we consider @xmath31 bcs corresponding to a strong adsorption preference for one of the two components of the confined liquid . 
 in particular , we consider two three - dimensional spheres of radii @xmath32 and @xmath33 with bcs @xmath34 and ( @xmath35 ) , respectively , facing a laterally homogeneous substrate with bc @xmath36 . 
 colloid ( 1 ) is positioned at a sphere - surface - to - substrate distance @xmath37 and colloid ( 2 ) is at a surface - to - surface distance @xmath261 from colloid ( 1 ) ( see fig . 
 [ vertical_sketch ] ) . 
 the coordinate system @xmath39 is chosen such that the centers of the spheres are located at @xmath262 and @xmath263 so that the distance between the centers , along the @xmath74-axis , is given by @xmath264 . as before , the bcs of the system as a whole are represented by the set @xmath44 , where @xmath45 , @xmath35 , and @xmath46 can be either @xmath47 or @xmath48 . 
 and @xmath33 immersed in a near - critical binary liquid mixture ( not shown ) and close to a homogeneous , planar substrate at @xmath63 . the colloidal particle ( 1 ) with bc @xmath34 
 is located vertically at the sphere - surface - to - substrate distance @xmath37 , whereas the colloidal particle ( 2 ) with bc @xmath64 is located vertically at the surface - to - surface distance @xmath261 between the spheres . 
 the substrate exhibits bc @xmath36 . 
 the vertical distance between the centers of the spheres along the @xmath74-direction is given by @xmath264 , while the centers of both spheres lie on the vertical axis @xmath265 . 
 in the case of four spatial dimensions the figure shows a three - dimensional cut of the system , which is invariant along the fourth direction , i.e. , the spheres correspond to parallel hypercylinders with one translationally invariant direction , which is @xmath66 [ see eq .  ] . ] 
 the normal ccf @xmath266 acting on colloid ( 1 ) along the @xmath74-direction takes the scaling form    @xmath267    where @xmath268 ( i.e. , @xmath269 for @xmath27 and @xmath270 for @xmath10 ) , @xmath76 , @xmath271 , and @xmath272 ; @xmath273 . 
 equation describes the singular contribution to the normal force emerging upon approaching @xmath11 . 
 @xmath274 is the force on a hypercylinder divided by its extension in the translationally invariant direction [ see eq .  ] . 
 we use the same reference system as the one described by eq .   in order to normalize the scaling function defined in eq .   according to    @xmath275 
 we calculate the many - body contribution to the normal ccf acting on particle ( 1 ) @xmath276 by subtracting from the total force the sum of the pairwise forces acting on it , i.e. , the colloid - colloid and the colloid - substrate forces [ see eq .  ] . 
 this many - body force takes the scaling form    @xmath277    in fig . 
 [ mb_vertical_z ] we show the normalized [ see eqs .  , , and ] scaling functions @xmath278 of the many - body contribution to the normal ccf acting on colloid ( 1 ) as functions of the scaling variable ratio @xmath279 for two spherical colloids of the same size ( @xmath207 ) . keeping the surface - to - surface distance between the spheres fixed at @xmath280 , we vary the sphere - surface - to - substrate distance @xmath37 for several bcs : @xmath156 in ( a ) , @xmath281 in ( b ) , @xmath197 in ( c ) , and @xmath157 in ( d ) .    from figs . 
 [ mb_vertical_z](a ) and ( d ) one can infer that if the colloids have symmetric bcs , the scaling function of the many - body normal ccf acting on colloid ( 1 ) is negative ( i.e. , it is directed towards the substrate ) for any value of @xmath198 . on the other hand , for non - symmetric bcs between the colloids [ figs . 
 [ mb_vertical_z](b ) and ( c ) ] , the many - body contribution to the normal ccf acting on colloid ( 1 ) is positive for any value of @xmath198 . 
 the apparent change of sign in figs .  [ mb_vertical_z](b ) and ( c ) is likely to be an artifact occurring within the error bars due to numerical imprecision . 
 the relative contribution of the many - body ccf to the total force is between 10@xmath256 and 15@xmath256 . 
 we point out that this configuration with the the two colloids vertically aligned with respect to the substrate allows for a wide range of interesting aspects which will be further explored in future works . 
 we have investigated critical casimir forces ( ccfs ) for a system composed of two equally sized spherical colloids ( @xmath207 ) immersed in a near - critical binary liquid mixture and close to a laterally homogeneous substrate with @xmath128 boundary condition ( bc ) ( see fig .  [ system_sketch ] ) . by denoting the set of bcs of the system as @xmath44 , where @xmath282 corresponds to the bc at colloid @xmath283 and @xmath46 to the bc at the substrate , we have first focused on the total normal and lateral forces acting on one of the colloids [ labeled as `` colloid ( 2 ) '' ] for several geometrical configurations of the system and various combinations of bcs at the colloids . 
 both the normal and the lateral forces are characterized by universal scaling functions [ eqs .   and , respectively ] , which have been studied in the one - phase region of the solvent as functions of @xmath284 and @xmath285 . 
 @xmath129 is the surface - to - surface distance between the two colloids , and @xmath178 is the bulk correlation length of the binary mixture in the mixed phase . we have used mean - field theory together with a finite element method in order to calculate the order parameter profiles , from which the stress tensor renders the normalized scaling functions associated with the ccfs .    for the scaling function of the total normal ccf acting on colloid ( 2 ) with @xmath145 bc , in the presence of colloid ( 1 ) with @xmath286 , we have found ( fig .  [ d2_z](a ) ) that the scaling function changes sign for a fixed value of @xmath284 as the distance @xmath38 between colloid ( 2 ) and the substrate increases , signaling the occurrence of an unstable mechanical equilibrium configuration of a vanishing normal force . for the total normal ccf acting on colloid ( 2 ) with @xmath144 bc and in the presence of colloid ( 1 ) with @xmath133 , we have found ( fig .  [ d2_z](b ) ) 
 that the force changes sign upon changing the temperature . 
 for this combination of bcs , the equilibrium configuration of colloid ( 2 ) is stable in the normal direction .    without a substrate , at the critical composition of the solvent 
 the ccf between two @xmath22 spheres is identical to the one between two @xmath23 ones . 
 this degeneracy is lifted by the presence of the substrate as one can infer from the comparison of the scaling functions for the lateral ccfs for @xmath156 and @xmath157 bcs [ see figs . 
 [ d2_x](a ) and ( b ) , respectively ] . in the first case 
 , the shape of the scaling function resembles that of the two colloids far away from the substrate , with a minimum at @xmath287 . in the second case 
 this minimum at @xmath288 disappears . 
 these substrate - induced changes are more pronounced if the two spheres are close to the substrate ( fig . 
 [ d2_x ] ) . without a substrate 
 the ccf between spheres of opposite bcs is purely repulsive . in the presence of a substrate 
 the corresponding lateral ccf for @xmath197 bcs turns attractive for large lateral distances @xmath129 ( fig . 
 [ l_x ] ) , which is a pure many - body effect . 
 we have also studied the direction of the total ccf acting on colloid ( 2 ) for various spatial configurations and bcs in order to assess the preferred arrangement of the colloids . for @xmath156 bcs 
 we have found that they tend to aggregate laterally . in this case a collection of colloids with @xmath22 bcs , facing a substrate with the same bc , are expected to form a monolayer on the substrate . 
 for the situation of @xmath157 bcs , we have found that the colloids are expected to aggregate on top of each other . 
 this indicates that a set of several colloids with such bcs are expected to form three - dimensional clusters . 
 these tendencies are enhanced upon approaching the critical point ( fig . 
 [ direction_resulting_force_d2 ] ) .    by calculating the pairwise colloid - colloid and colloid - substrate forces and subtracting them from the total force , 
 we have determined the pure many - body contribution to the force acting on colloid ( 2 ) . for the scaling functions associated with the normal many - body ccfs we have found the interesting feature of a change of sign at fixed temperature upon varying the lateral position of colloid ( 2 ) ( fig . 
 [ mb_l_z ] ) . 
 this implies that , for a given temperature , there is a lateral position where the normal many - body ccf is zero , in which case the sum of pairwise forces provides a quantitatively reliable description of the interactions of the system . as expected we have found that the contribution of the many - body ccfs to the total force is large if the colloid - colloid and colloid - substrate distances are small , as well as if the binary liquid mixture is close to its critical point . 
 we have compared our results with corresponding ones for quantum - electrodynamic casimir interactions . to this end 
 we have referred to the results in ref . 
 @xcite for two dielectric spheres immersed in ethanol and facing a plate . 
 these authors analyze the influence of the distance @xmath289 from the plate on the equilibrium separation @xmath217 between the spheres , which are subject to quantum - electrodynamic casimir forces . 
 they find that the lateral many - body force is attractive ( repulsive ) if the stronger one of the two normal sphere - plate forces is attractive ( repulsive ) [ figs . 
 [ comparing](a ) and ( b ) ] . on the other hand , 
 in the case of ccfs we have found that for a configuration in which the surface - to - surface distance between the colloids is equal to the sphere - surface - to - substrate ones and equal to the radius of the spheres , the many - body contribution to the lateral ccf is always attractive , regardless of the bcs ( fig . 
 [ mb_x ] ) . 
 we have also compared our results with the corresponding ones for the case of two atoms close to the planar surface of a solid body . in this respect 
 we have referred to the mclachlan model  @xcite for the many - body contribution to the van der waals potential [ see eq .   and fig . 
 [ mclachan_fig ] ] and the results from ref . 
 @xcite . from this comparison 
 we have found that if the two atoms are fixed at the same distance from the surface of the solid body , the normal many - body contribution to the total van der waals force decays with the atom - atom distance @xmath225 as @xmath248 for large atom - atom distances . 
 this decay is much faster than the decay we estimate for the many - body contribution to the normal ccf , which within a suitable range appears to be slower than @xmath250 . 
 furthermore , we have found that the many - body contribution to the lateral van der waals force is repulsive while the corresponding many - body ccf is attractive regardless of the set of bcs . 
 finally we have considered the configuration in which the two colloids are vertically aligned with respect to the substrate ( fig . 
 [ vertical_sketch ] ) . 
 we have calculated the many - body contribution to the normal ccf acting on colloid ( 1 ) for two spherical colloids of the same size ( @xmath207 ) keeping the sphere - surface - to - surface distance @xmath280 fixed ( fig . 
 [ mb_vertical_z ] ) . 
 we have varied the sphere - surface - to - substrate distance @xmath37 for several bcs and have found that if the colloids have the same bcs , the many - body contribution to the normal ccf is directed towards the substrate [ figs . 
 [ mb_vertical_z](a ) and ( d ) ] , whereas for colloids with opposite bcs , the many - body contribution to the normal ccf is directed away from the substrate [ figs . 
 [ mb_vertical_z](b ) and ( c ) ] . 
 we have found that the contribution of the many - body ccf to the total force is between 10@xmath256 and 15@xmath256 .

"multiple optimised parameter estimation and data compression ( moped ;  @xcite ) is a patented algorithm for the compression of data and the speeding up of the evaluation of likelihood functions in astronomical data analysis and beyond . 
 it becomes particularly useful when the noise covariance matrix is dependent upon the parameters of the model and so must be calculated and inverted at each likelihood evaluation . 
 however , such benefits come with limitations . since moped only guarantees maintaining the fisher matrix of the likelihood at a chosen point , multimodal and some degenerate distributions will present a problem . in this paper we report on some of the limitations of the application of the moped algorithm . in the cases where moped does accurately represent the likelihood function 
 , however , its compression of the data and consequent much faster likelihood evaluation does provide orders of magnitude improvement in runtime . in  @xcite , 
 the authors demonstrate the method by analysing the spectra of galaxies and in  @xcite they illustrate the benefits of moped for estimation of the cmb power spectrum . 
 the problem of `` badly '' behaved likelihoods was found by  @xcite for the problem of light transit analysis ; nonetheless , the authors present a solution that still allows moped to provide a large speed increase . 
 we begin by introducing moped in section  2 and define the original and moped likelihood functions , along with comments on the potential speed benefits of moped . in section 
 3 we introduce an astrophysical scenario where we found that moped did not accurately portray the true likelihood function . in section  4 
 we expand upon this scenario to another where moped is found to work and to two other scenarios where it does not . 
 we present a discussion of the criteria under which we believe moped will accurately represent the likelihood in section  5 , as well as a discussion of an implementation of the solution provided by  @xcite . 
 full details of the moped method are given in  @xcite , here we will only present a limited introduction . 
 we begin by defining our data as a vector , @xmath0 . 
 our model describes @xmath0 by a signal plus random noise , @xmath1 where the signal is given by a vector @xmath2 that is a function of the set of parameters @xmath3 defining our model , and the true parameters are given by @xmath4 . 
 the noise is assumed to be gaussian with zero mean and noise covariance matrix @xmath5 , where the angle brackets indicate an ensemble average over noise realisations ( in general this matrix may also be a function of the parameters @xmath6 ) . 
 the full likelihood for @xmath7 data points in @xmath0 is given by @xmath8^{\textrm{t } } \mathcal{n}(\btheta)^{-1 } [ { \bf x}-{\bf u}(\btheta)]\right\}}.\end{aligned}\ ] ] at each point , then , this requires the calculation of the determinant and inverse of an @xmath9 matrix . both scale as @xmath10 , 
 so even for smaller datasets this can become cumbersome . 
 moped allows one to eliminate the need for this matrix inversion by compressing the @xmath7 data points in @xmath0 into @xmath11 data values , one for each parameters of the model . 
 additionally , moped creates the compressed data values such that they are independent and have unit variance , further simplifying the likelihood calculation on them to an @xmath12 operation . 
 typically , @xmath13 so this gives us a significant increase in speed . 
 a single compression is done on the data , @xmath0 , and then again for each point in parameter space where we wish to compute the likelihood . 
 the compression is done by generating a set of weighting vectors , @xmath14 ( @xmath15 ) , from which we can generate a set of moped components from the theoretical model and data , @xmath16 note that the weighting vectors must be computed at some assumed fiducial set of parameter values , @xmath17 . 
 the only choice that will truly maintain the likelihood peak is when the fiducial parameters are the true parameters , but obviously we will not know these in advance for real analysis situations . 
 thus , we can choose our fiducial model to be anywhere and iterate the procedure , taking our likelihood peak in one iteration as the fiducial model for the next iteration . 
 this process will converge very quickly , and may not even be necessary in some instances . for our later examples , since we do know the true parameters we will use these as the fiducial ( @xmath18 ) in order to remove this as a source of confusion ( all equations , however , are written for the more general case ) . 
 note that the true parameters , @xmath4 , will not necessarily coincide with the peak @xmath19 of the original likelihood or the peak @xmath20 of the moped likelihood ( see below ) . 
 the weighting vectors must be generated in some order so that each subsequent vector ( after the first ) can be made orthogonal to all previous ones . 
 we begin by writing the derivative of the model with respect to the @xmath21th parameter as @xmath22 . 
 this gives us a solution for the first weighting vector , properly normalised , of @xmath23 the first compressed value is @xmath24 and will weight up the data combination most sensitive to the first parameter . 
 the subsequent weighting vectors are made orthogonal by subtracting out parts that are parallel to previous vectors , and are normalized . 
 the resulting formula for the remaining weighting vectors is @xmath25 @xmath26 where @xmath27 . 
 weighting vectors generated with equations   and   form an orthnomal set with respect to the noise covariance matrix so that @xmath28 this means that the noise covariance matrix of the compressed values @xmath29 is the identity , which significantly simplifies the likelihood calculation . 
 the new likelihood function is given by @xmath30 where @xmath31 represents the compressed data and @xmath32 represents the compressed signal . 
 this is a much easier likelihood to calculate and is time - limited by the generation of a new signal template instead of the inversion of the noise covariance matrix . 
 the peak value of the moped likelihood function is not guaranteed to be unique as there may be other points in the original parameter space that map to the same point in the compressed parameter space ; this is a characteristic that we will investigate . 
 moped implicity assumes that the covariance matrix , @xmath33 , is independent of the parameters . with this assumption , 
 a full likelihood calculation with @xmath7 data points would require only an @xmath34 operation at each point in parameter space ( or @xmath35 if @xmath33 is diagonal ) . in moped 
 , however , the compression of the theoretical data is an @xmath36 linear operation followed by an @xmath12 likelihood calculation . 
 thus , one loses on speed if @xmath33 is diagonal but gains by a factor of @xmath37 otherwise . for the data sets we will analyze , @xmath38 . 
 we begin , though , by assuming a diagonal @xmath33 for simplicity , recognizing that this will cause a speed reduction but that it is a necessary step before addressing a more complex noise model . 
 one can iterate the parameter estimation procedure if necessary , taking the maximum likelihood point found as the new fiducial and re - analyzing ( perhaps with tighter prior constraints ) ; this procedure is recommended for moped in  @xcite , but is not always found to be necessary . 
 moped has the additional benefit that the weighting vectors , @xmath39 , need only to be computed once provided the fiducial model parameters are kept constant over the analysis of different data sets . computed compressed parameters , @xmath40 , 
 can also be stored for re - use and require less memory than storing the entire theoretical data set . 
 in order to demonstrate some of the limitations of the applicability of the moped algorithm , we will consider a few test cases . 
 these originate in the context of gravitational wave data analysis for the _ laser interferometer space antenna _ 
 ( _ lisa _ ) since it is in this scenario that we first discovered such cases of failure . 
 the full problem is seven - dimensional parameter estimation , but we have fixed most of these variables to their known true values in the simulated data set in order to create a lower - dimensional problem that is simpler to analyse . 
 we consider the case of a sine - gaussian burst signal present in the lisa detector . 
 the short duration of the burst with respect to the motion of lisa allows us to use the static approximation to the response . in frequency space , 
 the waveform is described by  ( @xcite ) @xmath41 here @xmath42 is the dimensionless amplitude factor ; @xmath43 is the width of the gaussian envelope of the burst measured in cycles ; @xmath44 is the central frequency of the oscillation being modulated by the gaussian envelope ; and @xmath45 is the central time of arrival of the burst . 
 this waveform is further modulated by the sky position of the burst source , @xmath46 and @xmath47 , and the burst polarisation , @xmath48 , as they project onto the detector . 
 the one - sided noise power spectral density of the lisa detector is given by  ( @xcite ) @xmath49 where @xmath50s is the light travel time along one arm of the lisa constellation , @xmath51hz@xmath52 is the proof mass acceleration noise and @xmath53hz@xmath52 is the shot noise . 
 this is independent of the signal parameters and all frequencies are independent of each other , so the noise covariance matrix is constant and diagonal . 
 this less computationally expensive example allows us to show some interesting examples . 
 we begin by taking the one - dimensional case where the only unknown parameter of the model is the central frequency of the oscillation , @xmath44 . 
 we set @xmath54 and @xmath55s ; we then analyze a @xmath56s segment of lisa data , beginning at @xmath57s , sampled at a @xmath58s cadence . 
 for this example , the data was generated with random noise ( following the lisa noise power spectrum ) at an snr of @xmath59 with @xmath60hz ( thus @xmath61hz for moped ) . 
 the prior range on the central frequency goes from @xmath62hz to @xmath63hz . 
 @xmath64 samples uniformly spaced in @xmath44 were taken and their likelihoods calculated using both the original and moped likelihood functions . 
 the log - likelihoods are shown in figure  [ fig : likecomp ] . 
 note that the absolute magnitudes are not important but the relative values within each plot are meaningful . 
 both the original and moped likelihoods have a peak close to the input value @xmath65 .     for the chosen template.,width=312 ] 
 we see , however , that in going from the original to moped log - likelihoods , the latter also has a second peak of equal height at an incorrect @xmath44 . to see where this peak comes from 
 , we look at the values of the compressed parameter @xmath66 as it varies with respect to @xmath44 as shown in figure  [ fig : yf_vs_f ] . 
 the true compressed value peak occurs at @xmath67hz , where @xmath68 . 
 however , we see that there is another frequency that yields this exact same value of @xmath66 ; it is at this frequency that the second , incorrect peak occurs .        by creating a mapping from @xmath44 to @xmath66 that is not one - to - one , moped has created the possibility for a second solution that is indistinguishable in likelihood from the correct one . 
 this is a very serious problem for parameter estimation . 
 interestingly , we find that even when moped fails in a one - parameter case , adding a second parameter may actually rectify the problem , although not necessarily . if we now allow the width of the burst , @xmath43 , to be a variable parameter , there are now two orthognal moped weighting vectors that need to be calculated . 
 this gives us two compressed parameters for each pair of @xmath44 and @xmath43 . 
 each of these may have its own unphysical degeneracies , but in order to give an unphysical mode of equal likelihood to the true peak , these degeneracies will need to coincide . in figure  [ fig : ytruecontours ] , we plot the contours in @xmath69 space of where @xmath70 as @xmath6 ranges over @xmath44 and @xmath43 values . 
 we can clearly see the degeneracies present in either variable , but since these only overlap at the one location , near to where the true peak is , there is no unphysical second mode in the moped likelihood .     and @xmath71 as they vary over @xmath44 and @xmath43 . 
 the one intersection is the true maximum likelihood peak.,width=312 ]    hence , when we plot the original and moped log - likelihoods in figure  [ fig : fqlikes ] , although the behaviour away from the peak has changed , the peak itself remains in the same location and there is no second mode . 
 adding more parameters , however , does not always improve the situation . 
 we now consider the case where @xmath43 is once again fixed to its true value and we instead make the polarisation of the burst , @xmath48 , a variable parameter . 
 there are degeneracies in both of these parameters and in figure  [ fig : ytruecontours3 ] we plot the contours in @xmath72-space where the compressed values are each equal to the value at the maximum moped likelihood point . 
 these two will necessarily intersect at the maximum likelihood solution , near the true value ( @xmath73 hz and @xmath74 rad ) , but a second intersection is also apparent . 
 this second intersection will have the same likelihood as the maximum and be another mode of the solution . 
 however , as we can see in figure  [ fig : fpslikes ] in the left plot , this is not a mode of the original likelihood function . 
 moped has , in this case , created a second mode of equal likelihood to the true peak .     and 
 @xmath75 values as they vary as functions of @xmath44 and @xmath48.,width=312 ]        for an even more extreme scenario , we now fix to the true @xmath48 and allow the time of arrival of the burst @xmath45 to vary ( we also define @xmath76 ) . in this scenario , the contours in @xmath77-space where @xmath70 are much more complicated . 
 thus , we have many more intersections of the two contours than just at the likelihood peak near the true values and moped creates many alternative modes of likelihood equal to that of the original peak . 
 this is very problematic for parameter estimation . in figure 
 [ fig : ytruecontours2 ] we plot these contours so the multiple intersections are apparent . 
 figure  [ fig : ftlikes ] shows the original and moped log - likelihoods , where we can see the single peak becoming a set of peaks .     and 
 @xmath75 values as they vary as functions of @xmath44 and @xmath45 . 
 we can see many intersections here other than the true peak.,width=312 ] 
 what we can determine from the previous two sections is a general rule for when moped will generate additional peaks in the likelihood function equal in magnitude to the true one . for an @xmath11-dimensional model , if we consider the @xmath78-dimensional hyper - surfaces where @xmath70 , then any point where these @xmath11 hyper - surfaces intersect will yield a set of @xmath6-parameter values with likelihood equal to that at the peak near the true values . 
 we expect that there will be at least one intersection at the likelihood peak corresponding to approximately the true solution . 
 however , we have shown that other peaks can exist as well . 
 the set of intersections of contour surfaces will determine where these additional peaks are located . 
 this degeneracy will interact with the model s intrinsic degeneracy , as any degenerate parameters will yield the same compressed values for different original parameter values . 
 unfortunately , there is no simple way to find these contours other than by mapping out the @xmath79 values , which is equivalent in procedure to mapping the moped likelihood surface . 
 the benefit comes when this procedure is significantly faster than mapping the original likelihood surface . 
 the mapping of @xmath79 can even be performed before data is obtained or used , if the fiducial model is chosen in advance ; this allows us to analyse properties of the moped compression before applying it to data analysis . if the moped likelihood is mapped and there is only one contour intersection , then we can rely on the moped algorithm and will have saved a considerable amount of time , since moped has been demonstrated to provide speed - ups of a factor of up to @xmath80 in  @xcite . 
 however , if there are multiple intersections then it is necessary to map the original likelihood to know if they are due to degeneracy in the model or were created erroneously by moped . in this latter case 
 , the time spent finding the moped likelihood surface can be much less than that which will be needed to map the original likelihood , so relatively little time will have been wasted . if any model degeneracies are known in advance , then we can expect to see them in the moped likelihood and will not need to find the original likelihood on their account . 
 one possible way of determining the validity of degenerate peaks in the moped likelihood function is to compare the original likelihoods of the peak parameter values with each other . by using the maximum moped likelihood point found in each mode and evaluating the original likelihood at this point 
 , we can determine which one is correct . 
 the correct peak and any degeneracy in the original likelihood function will yield similar values to one another , but a false peak in the moped likelihood will have a much lower value in the original likelihood and can be ruled out . 
 this means that a bayesian evidence calculation can not be obtained from using the moped likelihood ; however , the algorithm was not designed to be able to provide this . 
 the solution for this problem presented in  @xcite is to use multiple fiducial models to create multiple sets of weighting vectors . 
 the log - likelihood is then averaged across these choices . 
 each different fiducial will create a set of likelihood peaks that include the true peaks and any extraneous ones . 
 however , the only peaks that will be consistent between fiducials are the correct ones . 
 therefore , the averaging maintains the true peaks but decreases the likelihood at incorrect values . 
 this was tested with 20 random fiducials for the two - parameter models presented and was found to leave only the true peak at the maximum likelihood value . 
 other , incorrect , peaks are still present , but at log - likelihood values five or more units below the true peak . 
 when applied to the full seven parameter model , however , the snr threshold for signal recovery is increased significantly , from @xmath81 to @xmath82 . 
 the moped algorithm for reducing the computational expense of likelihood functions can , in some examples , be extremely useful and provide orders of magnitude of improvement . 
 however , as we have shown , this is not always the case and moped can produce erroneous peaks in the likelihood that impede parameter estimation . 
 it is important to identify whether or not moped has accurately portrayed the likelihood function before using the results it provides . 
 some solutions to this problem have been presented and tested ,

"spectroscopic studies of hyperfine manifolds in alkalies , such as measurements of energy separations , have benefitted by the high precision of the experimental techniques available to interrogate atoms @xcite . 
 their hydrogen - like structure makes interpretation of experimental results straightforward in terms of electromagnetic fields generated by the valence electron and nuclear moments . 
 precise measurements in higher excited states accessible through two - step transitions@xcite have appeared in recent years . 
 this has renewed interest in improving calculations in other states where theoretical methods such as many - body perturbation theory ( mbpt ) ( see for example the recent book of w. r. johnson @xcite ) are yet to be tested against experimental results . 
 precise measurements in excited states , beyond the first one , have several experimental complications . 
 standard spectroscopic techniques rely on the high population of atoms in the ground state to guarantee a good signal to noise ratio of the fluorescence or absorption of the atomic sample . in two - step transitions 
 this is no longer the case . 
 the amount of population transferred to the intermediate level , for reasonable powers of the lasers , tends to be small , and detectors at the desired frequency might no be readily available . 
 we present in this paper two - color modulation transfer spectroscopy as a tool for studies of atomic properties of higher excited states . 
 the method consist of two lasers ( pump and probe ) counter - propagating through a thermal vapour . before being directed to the interaction region , 
 one of the lasers is modulated . 
 the first step of the transition _ 
 i.e. _ the pump , connects the ground state to a resonant intermediate state while the probe scans over the desired energy manifold . 
 we monitor the absorption of the pump laser as a function of probe laser detuning . 
 the non - linear interaction of the lasers  burns a hole "" in the atomic ground state population . 
 the generated spectra presents sub - doppler peaks ( sometimes called lamb - bennett dips ) corresponding to the atomic resonances with the trademark sidebands at their side . 
 this technique overcomes the two main inconveniences of direct absorption of the probing laser _ i.e. _ low signal to noise ratio and non - availability of detectors at the desired wavelength . 
 we present two ladder systems in @xmath0rb to illustrate the main features of the technique and two different applications of the modulation . 
 we select the @xmath1 and the @xmath2 ladder transitions to illustrate their different uses . 
 the amplitude of the probe laser is modulated for the first system while the second system has its pump frequency modulated . 
 the frequency modulation of the pump laser and good signal to noise ratio allows us to lock the probe laser to the @xmath3 excited atomic resonance . in this case 
 the probe laser remains modulation free . 
 this is highly desired since the electronic modulation of the laser itself can carry unwanted effects such as sidebands at higher or lower frequencies as well as bandwidth problems . 
 the method we are presenting is , of course , not limited to these two cases and can be extended to other atomic levels . 
 the organization of the paper is as follows : section ii contains the theoretical model , section iii explains the experimental setup and results , section iv has a summary of the precise measurements using this method , and section v presents the conclusions . 
 we start with a three level model that can show some of the qualitative features of the experimental spectra . 
 we use a density matrix formalism to describe a three level atom in ladder configuration interacting with two lasers , one of which has sidebands . 
 we model our system as doppler - free ignoring zeeman sublevels to keep it tractable . 
 the experimental situation is more complex and for quantitative analysis it is necessary to take into account those same effects that we are ignoring . 
 figure [ figure energy levels theory ] shows our theoretical model . 
 we treat two cases . 
 fig [ figure energy levels theory ] ( a ) is a ladder type system with an amplitude modulated probe ( amp ) . 
 fig ( b ) presents the same system except it has a frequency modulated pump ( fmp ) . 
 the intermediate and last levels are coupled by a single laser with three frequencies : a carrier and two sidebands separated form the carrier by @xmath4 ( in mhz ) . 
 we represent the amplitude of the carrier by a rabi frequency @xmath5 and the sidebands by a modulation depth @xmath6 . the ground and intermediate states are coupled by @xmath7 . 
 the detuning of the carrier between levels @xmath8 and @xmath9 is zero in the model as it is for our experiment and we let the detuning between levels @xmath9 and @xmath10 vary as @xmath11 . 
 the total population is normalized to unity . 
 [ figure energy levels theory ] ( b ) follows the same nomenclature except that the sidebands arise from frequency modulation and they appear in the pump laser @xmath7 . for the fmp systems the sidebands have the appropriate sign difference . 
 we have a set of nine linear equations for the slowly varying elements of the density matrix @xmath12 after using the rotating wave approximation with the sidebands rotating - one clockwise , one counter clockwise - at a frequency @xmath4 . 
 the equations are :    @xmath13\sigma_{nm}~+}\\    & & \frac{i}{2}\sum_{k}(\alpha_{nk}\sigma_{km}-\sigma_{nk}\alpha_{km})=\dot{\sigma}_{nm}~for~n\neq m,\nonumber\end{aligned}\ ] ]    where @xmath14 is the transition frequency , and @xmath15 is the laser frequency connecting the levels . 
 the damping rate is given by : @xmath16 and @xmath17 for the fmp system and @xmath18 for the amp system . 
 the time dependence of the rabi frequency makes the standard approach of obtaining the steady state solution of the system not feasible . 
 instead , we use a floquet basis expansion of the density matrix @xcite to solve our system of equations . 
 we replace each of the slowly rotating elements of the density matrix by :    @xmath19    where @xmath20 is the fourier amplitude of the component oscillating at @xmath21 . 
 the system is now a series of @xmath22 coupled equations for some large @xmath23 that have to be solved recursively . 
 it is necessary to set @xmath24 for some @xmath23 to cut off the infinite number of coupled equations . by solving the equations in terms of their predecessors 
 we can extract @xmath25 .    .

 the parameters are ( in units of @xmath26 ) : @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , and @xmath36,width=283 ]    for our experiment we are interested in the terms @xmath37 , @xmath38 , and @xmath39 which are proportional to the absorption of the first laser carrier and sidebands , respectively . 
 we plot the absolute value of the imaginary part as a function of @xmath11 to recover the absorption . 
 this is necessary to take into account the square - law nature of the photodiode . 
 our three level model reproduces the resonance features of the absorption observed as the second excitation goes into resonance for both amp and fmp systems ( see fig . 
 [ figure absorption am ] and fig . 
 [ figure absorption fm ] , respectively ) . 
 the demodulation of the fmp signal yields the expected error - like feature shown in fig .

 a coherent 899 - 01 ti : sapphire laser with a linewidth of less than 100 khz is the pump laser in both cases . a small amount of laser power from the pump laser is frequency modulated by a small bandwidth electro - optical modulator at @xmath4315 mhz and sent to a glass cell filled with rubidium at room temperature to lock the laser frequency to the @xmath44 crossover line of the @xmath45 and @xmath46 hyperfine levels for the fmp system and to the on resonance @xmath47 transition of the @xmath48 level for the amp system at 795 nm with a pound - drever - hall lock . 
 level @xmath8 in the amp system corresponds to the lower hyperfine state of the 5s@xmath49 level ( @xmath45 ) while @xmath9 is the highest hyperfine state of the 5p@xmath49 level ( @xmath50 ) of @xmath0rb . 
 the decay rate between the two levels is @xmath51 5.7  mhz @xcite .

 we scan the probe laser over the @xmath56 level hyperfine manifold and observe the absorption of the pump laser as a function of the probe laser detuning using a fast photodetector . 
 we send the signal to a bias - t and record the dc and demodulated ac components with a wavesurfer digital oscilloscope with an 8-bit resolution from lecroy . 
 we keep the power of the pump laser and the modulation depth fixed to a value of 100 @xmath54w and @xmath57 , respectively . 
 we change the power of the probe beam and observe its influence on the spectra . 
 it is possible to observe the resonant features of the @xmath56 hyperfine manifold with little as 100 @xmath54w of probe power . 
 higher probe power increases the signal size and the width of the features . playing with the polarization and powers we also observe eit features @xcite . 
 we restrict ourselves to a space parameter where these very narrow features are absent .

 this effectively translates a measurement of energy spacings from the optical region to a much easier measurement in the radio frequency range .

 the characteristic sidebands appearing the spectra have the two - fold utility of working as an _ in situ _ 
 ruler for measurements of energy separations or to lock the frequency of a laser to an excited transition . 
 the good quality of the data presented is due to monitoring of the absorption of the pump beam instead of direct absorption of the probe beam . 
 the absorption of the pump beam ( or lack thereof ) , is always guaranteed since a vast amount of atoms are always in the ground state and even small changes _ 
 i.e. _ excitation to the last step of the transition , will be noticeable even for small powers of the pump beam . 
 in addition , the spectra does not show a doppler background due to the lack of an equilibrium thermal population in the intermediate state . 
 it is the hope that the method will stimulate studies of atomic properties of excited states and further push the experimental precision and theoretical work in excited atomic states .

"the range of hi  column densities typically seen in routine 21-cm emission line observations of the neutral gas disks in nearby galaxies is very similar to those that characterise the damped lyman-@xmath6 systems or dlas with @xmath7 . 
 an attractive experiment would therefore be to map the hi  gas of dla absorbing systems in 21-cm emission , and measure the dlas total gas mass , the extent of the gas disks and their dynamics . 
 this would provide a direct observational link between dlas and local galaxies , but unfortunately such studies are impossible with present technology ( see e.g. , kanekar et al . 
 the transition probability of the hyperfine splitting that causes the 21-cm line is extremely small , resulting in a weak line that can only be observed in emission in the very local ( @xmath8 ) universe , with present technology . on the other hand , 
 the identification of dlas as absorbers in background qso spectra is , to first order , not distance dependent because the detection efficiency depends mostly on the brightness of the background source , not on the redshift of the absorber itself . 
 in fact , the lowest redshift ( @xmath9 ) lyman-@xmath6 absorbers can not be observed from the ground because the earth s atmosphere is opaque to the uv wavelength range in which these are to be found . 
 furthermore , due to the expansion of the universe the redshift number density of dlas decreases rapidly toward lower redshifts . consequently , there are not many dlas known whose 21-cm emission would be within the reach of present - day radio telescopes . 
 so , we are left with a wealth of information on the cold gas properties in local galaxies , which has been collected over the last half century , and several hundreds dla absorption profiles at intermediate and high redshift , but little possibility to bridge these two sets of information . obviously , most observers resort to the optical wavelengths to study dlas but attempts to directly image their host galaxies have been notably unsuccessful ( see e.g. , warren et al . 
 2001 and mller et al . 
 2002 for reviews ) . 
 a few positive identifications do exist , mostly the result of hst imaging . 
 although the absolute number of dlas at low @xmath3 is small , the success rate for finding low-@xmath3 host galaxies is better for obvious reasons : the host galaxies are expected to be brighter and the separation on the sky between the bright qso and the dla galaxy is likely larger . 
 early surveys for low-@xmath3 dla host galaxies consisted of broad band imaging and lacked spectroscopic follow - up ( e.g. , le brun et al.1997 ) . 
 later studies aimed at measuring redshifts to determine the association of optically identified galaxies with dlas , either spectroscopically ( e.g. , rao et al . 2003 ) , or using photometric redshifts ( chen & lanzetta 2003 ) . all together , there are now @xmath10 dla galaxies known at @xmath11 . 
 the galaxies span a wide range in galaxy properties , ranging from inconspicuous lsb dwarfs to giant spirals and even early type galaxies . 
 obviously , it is not just the luminous , high surface brightness spiral galaxies that contribute to the hi  cross section above the dla threshold . as explained above 
 , we can not study these galaxies in the 21-cm line on a case - by - case basis , but we can do a study of a statistical nature to see if the properties of dlas and dla galaxies agree with our knowledge of hi  in the local universe . 
 blind 21-cm emission line surveys in the local universe with single dish radio telescopes such as parkes or arecibo have resulted in an accurate measurement of @xmath12 , which can be used as a reference point for higher redshift dla studies . 
 @xmath13 is simply calculated by integrating over the hi  mass function of galaxies , which is measured with surveys such as hipass ( zwaan et al . 
 however , due to the large beam widths of the singe dish instruments , these surveys at best only barely resolve the detected galaxies and are therefore not very useful in constraining the column density distribution function of @xmath0 hi . 
 hence , for this purpose we use the high resolution 21-cm maps of a large sample of local galaxies that have been observed with the westerbork synthesis radio telescope . 
 this sample is known as whisp ( van der hulst et al . 2001 ) and consists of 355 galaxies spanning a large range in hi  mass and optical luminosity . 
 the total number of independent column density measurements above the dla limit is @xmath14 , which implies that the data volume of our present study is the equivalent of @xmath14 dlas at @xmath1 !    each galaxy in the sample 
 is weighted according to the hi  mass function of galaxies . 
 we can now calculate the column density distribution function , @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the area function that describes for galaxies with hi  mass  the area in @xmath17 corresponding to a column density in the range  to @xmath18 , and @xmath19 is the hi  mass function . 
 @xmath20 converts the number of systems per mpc to that per unit redshift . 
 figure  [ whispfn2.fig ] shows the resulting  on the left , and the derived hi  mass density per decade of  on the right . for comparison with higher redshift observations 
 , we also plot the results from two other studies . 
 the proux ( 2005 ) measurements of  below the dla limit are the result of their new uves survey for `` sub - dlas '' . 
 the intermediate redshift points from rao et al . 
 ( 2005 ) are based on mgii - selected dla systems . 
 the surprising result from this figure is that there appears to be only very mild evolution in the intersection cross section of hi  from redshift @xmath21 to the present . from this figure 
 we can determine the redshift number density of @xmath22 gas and find that @xmath23 , in good agreement with earlier measurements at @xmath1 . 
 compared to the most recent measurements of @xmath24 at intermediate and high @xmath3 , this implies that the comoving number density ( or the `` space density times cross section '' ) of dlas does not evolve after @xmath4 . in other words 
 , the local galaxy population explains the incidence rate of low and intermediate @xmath3 dlas and there is no need for a population of hidden very low surface brightness ( lsb ) galaxies or isolated hi  clouds ( dark galaxies ) . 
 the right hand panel shows that at @xmath1 most of the hi  atoms are in column densities around @xmath25 . 
 this also seems to be the case at higher redshifts , although the distribution might flatten somewhat . 
 the one point that clearly deviates is the highest  point from rao et al . 
 ( 2005 ) at @xmath26 . 
 the figure very clearly demonstrates that this point dominates the  measurement at intermediate redshifts . 
 it is therefore important to understand whether the mgii - based results really indicate that high column densities ( @xmath27 ) are rare at high and low redshift , but much more ubiquitous at intermediate redshifts , or whether the mgii  selection introduces currently unidentified biases . 
 now that we have accurate cross section measurement of all galaxies in our sample , and know what the space density of our galaxies is , we can calculate the cross - section weighted probability distribution functions of various galaxy parameters . 
 figure  [ pdfs.fig ] shows two examples . 
 the left panel shows the @xmath28-band absolute magnitude distribution of cross - section selected galaxies above four different hi  column density cut - offs . 
 87% of the dla cross - section appears to be in galaxies that are fainter than @xmath29 , and 45% is in galaxies with @xmath30 . 
 these numbers agree very well with the luminosity distribution of @xmath11 dla host galaxies . 
 taking into account the non - detections of dla host galaxies and assuming that these are @xmath31 , we find that 80% of the @xmath11 dla galaxies are sub-@xmath29 . 
 the median absolute magnitude of a @xmath1 dla galaxy is expected to be @xmath32 ( @xmath33 ) . 
 the conclusion to draw from this is that we should not be surprised to find that identifying dla host galaxies is difficult . 
 most of them ( some 87% ) are expected to be sub-@xmath29 and many are dwarfs .    using similar techniques , we find that the expected median impact parameter of @xmath34 systems is 7.8 kpc , whereas the median impact parameter of identified @xmath11 dla galaxies is 8.3 kpc . assuming no evolution in the properties of galaxies gas disks , these numbers imply that 37% of the impact parameters are expected to be less than @xmath35 for systems at @xmath36 . 
 this illustrates that very high spatial resolution imaging programs are required to successfully identify a typical dla galaxy at intermediate redshifts . 
 the right panel in figure  [ pdfs.fig ] shows the probability distribution of oxygen abundance in @xmath1 dlas . 
 we constructed this diagram by assigning to every hi  pixel in our 21-cm maps an oxygen abundance , based on the assumption that the galaxies in our sample follow the local metallicity  luminosity ( @xmath37 ) relation ( e.g. garnett 2002 ) , and that each disk shows an abundance gradient of [ o / h ] of @xmath38 ( e.g. , ferguson et al . 
 1998 ) along the major axis . 
 the solid lines correspond to these assumptions , the dotted lines are for varying metallicity gradients in disks of different absolute brightness . 
 the main conclusion is that the metallicity distribution for hi  column densities @xmath34 peaks around [ o / h]=@xmath39 to @xmath40 , much lower than the mean value of an @xmath29 galaxy of [ o / h]@xmath41 . 
 the reason for this being that _ 1 ) _ much of the dla cross section is in sub-@xmath29 galaxies , which mostly have sub - solar metallicities , and _ 2 ) _ for the more luminous , larger galaxies , the highest interception probability is at larger impact parameters from the centre , where the metallicity is lower . 
 interestingly , this number is very close to the @xmath1 extrapolations of metallicity measurements in dlas at higher @xmath3 from prochaska et al . 
 ( 2003 ) and kulkarni et al . 
 for the mean mass - weighted metallicity of hi  gas with @xmath34 at @xmath1 we find the value of @xmath42 , also consistent with the @xmath1 extrapolation of -weighted metallicities in dlas , although we note this extrapolation has large uncertainties given the poor statistics from dlas at @xmath43 . 
 these results are in good agreement with the hypothesis that dlas arise in the hi  disks of galaxies . 
 the local galaxy population can explain the incidence rate and metallicities of dlas , the luminosities of their host galaxies , and the impact parameters between centres of host galaxies and the background qsos .      1 chen , h.  & lanzetta , k.  m.  2003 , apj , 597 , 706 ferguson a.  m.  n. , gallagher j.  s. , wyse r.  f.  g. , 1998 , aj , 116 , 673 garnett d.  r. , 2002 , apj , 581 , 1019 kanekar n. , chengalur j.  n. , subrahmanyan r. , petitjean p. , 2001

 a sample of 355 nearby galaxies is analysed , for which high quality hi  21-cm emission line maps are available as part of an extensive survey with the westerbork telescope ( whisp ) . we find that expected luminosities , impact parameters between quasars and dla host galaxies , and metal abundances are in good agreement with the observed properties of dlas and dla galaxies . 
 the measured redshift number density of @xmath1 gas above the dla limit is @xmath2 , which compared to higher @xmath3 measurements implies that there is no evolution in the comoving density of dlas along a line of sight between @xmath4 and @xmath1 , and a decrease of only a factor of two from @xmath5 to the present time . 
 we conclude that the local galaxy population can explain all properties of low redshift dlas .

"quantum fluctuation can suppress chaotic motion of wave packet in the phase space due to the quantum interference , as seen in kicked rotor @xcite . on the contrary 
 , the quantum fluctuation can enhance the chaotic motion of wave packet due to tunneling effect as seen in kicked double - well model @xcite . 
 the relation between chaotic behavior and tunneling phenomenon in classically chaotic systems is interesting and important subject in study of quantum physics @xcite . 
 recently , the semiclassical description for the tunneling phenomena in a classically chaotic system have been developed by several groups @xcite . 
 lin and ballentine studied interplay between the tunneling and classical chaos for a particle in a double - well potential with oscillatory driving force @xcite . 
 they found that coherent tunneling takes place between small isolated classical stable regions of phase space bounded by kolmogorov - arnold - moser ( kam ) surfaces , which are much smaller than the volume of a single potential well . 
 hnggi and the coworkers studied the chaos - suppressed tunneling in the driven double - well model in terms of the floquet formalism @xcite . 
 they found a one - dimensional manifold in the parameter space , where the tunneling completely suppressed by the coherent driving . 
 the time - scale for the tunneling between the wells diverges because of intersection of the ground state doublet of the quasienergies . 
 while the mutual influence of quantum coherence and classical chaos has been under investigation since many years ago , the additional effects caused by coupling the chaotic system to the other degrees of freedom ( dof ) or an environment , namely _ decoherence and dissipation _ , have been studied only rarely @xcite as well as the tunneling phenomena in the chaotic system . 
 since mid - eighties there are some studies on environment - induced quantum decoherence by coupling the quantum system to a reservoir @xcite . 
 recently quantum dissipation due to the interaction with chaotic dof has been also studied@xcite . in this paper 
 we numerically investigate the relation _ quantum fluctuation , tunneling and decoherence _ combined to the delocalization in wave packet dynamics in one - dimensional double - well system driven by polychromatic external field .    before closing this section , 
 we refer to a study on a delocalization phenomenon by a perturbation with some frequency components in the other model . 
 _ have reported that the kicked rotator model with a frequency modulation amplitude of kick can be mapped to the tight - binding form ( loyld model ) on higher - dimensional lattice in solid - state physics under very specific condition @xcite . 
 then the number @xmath0 of the incommensurate frequencies corresponds the dimensionality of the tight - binding system . 
 the problem can be efficiently reduced to a localization problem in @xmath1 dimension . as seen in the case of kicked rotators 
 , we can also expect that in the double - well system the coupling with oscillatory perturbation is roughly equivalent to an increase in effective degrees of freedom and a transition from a localized wave packet to delocalized one is enhanced by the polychromatic perturbation . 
 the concrete confirmation of the naive expectation is one of aims of this numerical work . 
 we present the model in the next section . in sect.3 
 , we show the details of the numerical results of the time - dependence of the transition probability between the wells based on the quantum dynamics . 
 section 4 contains the summary and discussion . 
 furthermore , in appendix a , we gave details of the classical phase space portraits in the polychromatically perturbed double - well system and some considerations to the effect of polychromatic perturbation . in appendix b , a simple explanation for the perturbed instanton tunneling picture is given . 
 we consider a system described by the following hamiltonian , @xmath2 for the sake of simplicity , @xmath3 and @xmath4 are taken as @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 in the present paper . 
 then @xmath0 is the number of frequency components of the external field and @xmath8 is the perturbation strength respectively . 
 \{@xmath9 } are order of unity and mutually incommensurate frequencies . 
 we choose off - resonant frequencies which are far from both classical and quantum resonance in the corresponding unperturbed problem . 
 the parameter @xmath10 adjusts the distance between the wells and we set @xmath11 to make some energy doublets below the potential barrier . note that lin _ 
 dealt with a double - well system driven by forced oscillator ( duffing - like model ) , therefore , the asymmetry of the potential plays an important role in the chaotic behavior and tunneling transition between the symmetry - related kam tori @xcite . however , in our model the potential is remained symmetric during the time evolution process , and different mechanism from the forced oscillation makes the classical chaotic behavior @xcite .    in the previous paper 
 @xcite we presented numerical results concerning a classical and quantum description of the field - induced barrier tunneling under the monochromatic perturbation ( @xmath12 ) . in the unperturbed double - well system ( @xmath13 ) 
 the instanton describes the coherent tunneling motion of the initially localized wave packet . 
 it is also shown that the monochromatic perturbation can breaks the coherent motion as the perturbation strength increases near the resonant frequency in the previous paper . in the classical dynamics of our model , 
 outstanding feature different from previous studies is parametric instability caused by the polychromatic perturbation . 
 based on our criterion given below , we roughly estimate the type of the motion , i.e. the coherent and irregular motions , in a regime of the parameter space spanned by the amplitude and the number of frequency components of the oscillatory driving force . it is suggested that the occurrence of the irregular motion is related to dissipative property which is organized in the quantum physics @xcite . 
 the classical phase space portraits and simple explanation of relation to the dissipative property are given in appendix a. 
 we use gaussian wavepacket with zero momentum as the initial state , which is localized in the right well of the potential . 
 @xmath14 where @xmath15 means a bottom of the right well . 
 the gaussian wavepacket can be approximately generated by the linear combination of the ground state doublet as @xmath16 , where @xmath17 and @xmath18 denote the ground state doublet . 
 the recurrence time for the wavepacket is @xmath19 in the unperturbed case ( @xmath13 ) , where @xmath20 is the energy difference between the tunneling doublet of the ground state . 
 we set the spread of the initial packet @xmath21 and @xmath22 for simplicity throughout this paper . 
 indeed , the ammonia molecule is well described by two doublets below the barrier heigth in unperturbed case . 
 we numerically calculate the solution @xmath23 of time - dependent schrdinger equation by using second order unitary integration with time step @xmath24 . 
 we define _ transition probability _ of finding the wave packet in the left well , @xmath25 in the cases that the perturbation strength is relatively small , @xmath26 can be interpreted as the tunneling probability that the initially localized wave packet goes through the central energy barrier and reaches the left well . 
 we can expect that the transition probability @xmath26 is enhanced as the number @xmath0 of the frequency components increases up to some extent because of the increasing of the stochasticity in the total system .     as a function of time @xmath27 for various @xmath0 s . 
 ( a)@xmath28 . 
 ( b)@xmath29 . 
 the calculation time is same order to heisenberg time in the unperturbed case . ] 
 figure 1 shows the time - dependence of @xmath30 for various combinations of @xmath8 and @xmath0 . apparently we can observe the coherent and irregular motions . 
 the coherent motion of the wave packet can be well - described by the semiquantal picture in a sense that the wave packet does not delocalize to the fully delocalized state . 
 the semiquantal picture decomposes the motion of the wave packet into _ evolution of the centroid motion _ and _ the spreading and squeezing _ of the packet @xcite . 
 ( see subsect.3.5 . ) for example , in cases of relatively small perturbation strength ( @xmath28 ) , coherent motion remains still up to relatively large @xmath31 . 
 it is important to emphasize that the tunneling contribution to the transition probability @xmath32 is not so significant for large @xmath8 and/or @xmath0 . 
 then @xmath32 may be interpreted as a barrier crossing probability due to the activation - transition because the energy of wave packet increases over the barrier height in the parameter range . 
 especially , in the relatively large perturbation regime we can interpret the delocalized states as chaos - induced delocalization in a sense that the classical chaos enhances the quantum barrier crossing rate quite significantly . 
 the chaotic behavior in the classical dynamics is given in appendix a , based on the classical poincar section and so on @xcite . 
 in the present section , we mainly focus on the transition of the quantum state from the localized wavepacket to delocalized state based on the data of numerical calculation . 
 once the wave packet incoherently spreads into the space as the @xmath0 and/or @xmath8 increase , the wavepacket is delocalized and never return to gaussian shape again within the numerically accessible time . 
 apparently , we regard the delocalized quantum state as a decoherent state in a sense that the behavior of the wave packet is similar to that of the stochastically perturbed case . 
 ( see fig.5(a ) . ) in case of relatively small perturbation strength ( @xmath28 ) , the decoherence of quantum dynamics appears at around @xmath33 , and @xmath26 fluctuates irregularly in case of large @xmath34 . in short , the irreversible delocalization of a gaussian wave packet generates a transition from coherent oscillation to irregular fluctuation of @xmath26 . 
 we have confirmed that the similar behavior is also observed for other sets of values of the frequencies and the different initial phases @xmath35 of the perturbation .    here , we define a _ degree of coherence _ @xmath36 of the time - dependence of @xmath26 , based on the fluctuation of the transition probability in order to estimate quantitatively the difference between coherent and incoherent motions . @xmath37 where @xmath38 represents time average value for a period @xmath39 . 
 note that we used @xmath36 in order to express the decoherence of the tunneling osccilation of the transition probability in the parametrically perturbed double - well system . on the other hand , the other quantities such as _ purity _ , _ linear entropy _ and _ fidelity _ , are sometimes used to characterize the decoherence of the quantum system @xcite . 
 the transition of the dynamical behavior based on the fidelity for description of the decoherence in the double - well system will be given elsewhere @xcite . 
 dependence of the degree of coherence @xmath36 of tunneling probability for various @xmath0 s . 
 the @xmath40 is numerically estimated by @xmath26 . ] 
 figure 2 shows the perturbation strength dependence of @xmath36 for various @xmath0 s . 
 we roughly divide the type of motion of wave packet into three ones as follows . in the _ coherent motions _ , the value of @xmath36 s is almost same to the unperturbed case , i.e. @xmath41 , in which cases the instanton - like picture is valid @xcite . 
 a simple explanation of the perturbed instanton is given in appendix b.    in the _ irregular motions _ which are similar to the stochastically perturbed case , the value of @xmath36 s becomes much smaller , i.e. @xmath42 . as a matter of course , there are the intermediate cases between the coherent and the irregular motions , @xmath43 . 
 note that the exact criterion of the intermediate motion is not important in the present paper because we can expect that the transitional cases approach to the irregular case in the long - time behavior . 
 it should be stressed that the critical value @xmath44 exists , which divides the behavior of @xmath26 into regular and irregular motions .    . 
 circles(@xmath45 ) , crosses(@xmath46 ) , and triangles(@xmath47 ) denote coherent motions ( @xmath48 ) , irregular motions ( @xmath49 ) , and the transitional cases ( @xmath50 ) respectively . ] 
 figure 3 shows a classification of the motion in the parameter space which is estimated by the value of the degree of coherence @xmath51 . 
 it seems that two kinds of the motion , i.e. coherent and irregular motions , are divided by the thin layer corresponding to the `` transitional case '' . 
 as @xmath0 increases , decoherence of the motion appears even for small @xmath8 . 
 the numerical estimation suggests that there are the critical values @xmath52 of the perturbation strength depending on @xmath0 . when the perturbation strength @xmath8 exceeds the critical value @xmath53 for some @xmath0 , the tunneling oscillation loses the coherence . 
 the approximated phase diagram roughly same as the diagram generated by maximal lyapunov exponent of the classical dynamics . 
 ( see appendix a. )      in this subsection we give a consideration to the reduction of the tunneling period in the regular motion regime @xmath54 .     for @xmath12 and @xmath55 in the coherent motion regime @xmath54 . 
 ]    figure 4 shows the @xmath56dependence of the the period @xmath57 of the tunneling oscillation estimated by the numerical data @xmath26 in the coherent motion regime @xmath54 . 
 we can observe the monotonically decreasing of the tunneling period as the perturbation strength increases . 
 in the monochromatically perturbed case , the reduction of the tunneling period can be interpreted by applying the floquet theorem to the quasi - energy states and the quasi - energy as the hamiltonian is time - periodic @xmath58 . when the wave packet does not effecively absorb the energy from the external perturbation the time - dependence of the quantum state 
 can be described by the linear combination of a doublet of quasi - degenerate ground states with opposite parity because we prepare the initial state in @xmath16 and the evolution is adiabatic . in the two - state approximation that the avoided crossing of the eigenvalues dynamics does not appear during the time evolution 
 , it is expected that the state evolves as , @xmath59 where @xmath60 and @xmath61 denote the quasi - energies and floquet states of the time - periodic hamiltonian @xcite . under the approximation 
 we expect the following relation , @xmath62 where @xmath63 means quasi - energy splitting of the ground state doublet due to the tunneling between the wells .     in the monochromatically perturbed case ( @xmath12 ) . 
 ]    let us confirm the relation in eq.(7 ) numerically . in fig . 
 5 we show the @xmath56dependence of @xmath64 . the behavior is analogus to the @xmath56dependence of the tunneling period of the oscillation @xmath26 in fig . 
 4 , in the weak perturbation regime . 
 the similar correspondence between the tunneling period and the change of the quasi - energy splitting have been reported for the other double - well system by tomsovic _ 
 it is well - known that the chaos around the separatrix contributes to the enhancement of the tunneling split between the doublet , i.e. chaos - assisted tunneling . 
 the reduction of the tunneling period can be approximately explained by the chaos - assisted instanton picture in the coherent oscilation regime @xmath65 . 
 the simple explanation for the perturbed instanton picture based on the width of the chaotic layer in the classical dynamics is given in appendix b. ( see also appendix a. )    generally speaking , as the number of frequencies @xmath0 increases the tunneling period is more reduced as seen in fig.4 although we do not have analytic representation in the polychromatically perturbed cases . 
 we conjecture that as seen in appendix a the increasing of the width of the stochastic layer contributes the reduction of the tunneling period even in the polychromatically perturbed cases .     as a function of time for some combinations of the parameters .

 ( b)plots of the uncertainty product @xmath70 versus time for various @xmath71s with the stochastic perturbation . 
 the stochastic perturbation strength @xmath8 is normalized to be equivalent to one of the polychromatic perturbation . ]      here let us investigate the spread of the wave packet in the phase space ( @xmath72 ) . 
 hitherto we mainly investigated the dynamics in @xmath73space by @xmath26 . 
 the phase space volume gives a part of the compensating information for the phase space dynamics of the wave packet . 
 figure 6 presents the uncertainly product , i.e. phase space volume , as a function of time for various cases , which is defined by , @xmath74 where @xmath75 denotes quantum mechanical average . 
 the uncertainty product can be used as a measure of quantum fluctuation @xcite . 
 the initial value is @xmath76 for the gaussian wave packet . 
 it is found that in the case @xmath55 the increase of the perturbation strength does not break the coherent oscillation and enhances the frequency of the time - dependence of the uncertainty product . 
 for the relatively large @xmath8 in @xmath68 , @xmath77 increases until the wave packet is relaxed in the space , and it can not return to gaussian wave packet anymore . 
 for the larger time scale , it fluctuates around the corresponding certain level . 
 we can expect that the structure of the time dependence well corresponds to the behavior of the transition probability @xmath26 in fig 
 .      it will be instructive to compare the above irregular motion under the polychromatic perturbation with the stochastically perturbed one . 
 we recall that the stochastic perturbation , composed of the infinite number of the frequency components ( @xmath78 ) with absolute continuous spectrum , can break the coherent dynamics . 
 indeed , if the time dependence of the potential comes up with the stochastic fluctuation as @xmath79 , where @xmath80 and @xmath81 denote ensemble average and the temperature respectively , the stochastic perturbation partially models a heat bath coupled with the system @xcite . 
 then the number of the frequency component corresponds to the number of degrees of freedom coupled with the double - well system . 
 the @xmath26 for the stochastic perturbation is shown in fig . 
 the stochastic perturbation can be achieved numerically by replacing @xmath82 in the eq.(2 ) by random number and we use uniform random number which is normalized so that the power of the perturbation is the same order to one of the polychromatic case . in the limit of large @xmath0 
 the motion under the polychromatic perturbation tends to approach the one driven by the stochastic perturbation provided with the same perturbation strengths @xmath8 . 
 figure 7(b ) shows the uncertainty product @xmath77 for the stochastically perturbed cases . 
 it is found that the time - dependence of the uncertainty product in the stochastically perturbed case behaves similarly to the polychromatically perturbed ones for the relatively small @xmath83 . on the other hand , 
 for the relatively larger @xmath8(=0.4 ) the time - dependence shows quite different behavior . while @xmath77 grows linearly with time in the stochastically perturbed case , in the polychromatically perturbed cases the growth of @xmath77 saturates at a certain level . 
 the linear growth of @xmath77 shows that the external stochasticity breaks the quantum interference in the internal dynamics . 
 the growth of @xmath77 is strongly related to the growth of the energy of the packet @xcite . in the polychromatically 
 perturbed cases the energy growth saturates at certain level due to quantum interference . on the other hand , 
 in the case the energy grows unboundedly , the activation transition becomes much more dominant than the tunneling transition when the wave packet transfers the opposite well . 
 the details concerning relation between the stochastic resonance @xcite and suppression of the energy growth will be given elsewhere @xcite . 
 note that the polychromatic perturbation can be identified with a white noise ( or a colored noise if the frequencies are distributed over a finite band width ) only in the limit of @xmath78 , while the stochastic perturbation can model a heat bath that breaks the quantum interference of the system . 
 a similar phenomenon by the different property of the perturbation has been observed as `` dynamical localization '' and the `` noise - assisted mixing '' of the quantum state in the momentum space in the quantum kicked rotor model @xcite .     and the same parameters at @xmath84 , @xmath85 . 
 the selection of initial condition of the fluctuation follows the minimum uncertainty .

 contour lines in the panel ( e ) at the values 0.01 , 0.02 , 0.05 , 0.08 and 0.1 , in the panel ( f ) at 0.01 , 0.02 , 0.03 , 0.04 and 0.05 . @xmath87 and @xmath28 for ( a ) , ( c ) and ( e ) . @xmath87 and @xmath29 for ( b ) , ( d ) and ( f ) . ]      finally , in order to see effect of quantum fluctuation , we compare the quantum states with the classical and semiquantal motions in the phase space for some cases . the semiquantal equation of motion is given by generalized hamilton - like equations as , @xmath88 where the canonical conjugate pair @xmath89 is defined by the quantum fluctuation @xmath90 and @xmath91 as , @xmath92 . 
 for more details consult @xcite . 
 it is directly observed that the quantum tunneling phenomenon enhances chaotic motion in comparing to the classical and semiquantal trajectories . in fig.8(a ) and ( b ) poincar surface of section of the classical trajectories in the phase plane at @xmath87 are shown . 
 the stroboscopic plots are taken at @xmath93 , due to non time - periodic structure of the hamiltonian . in the relatively small perturbation strength @xmath28 
 , the trajectories stay the single well , and are stable even for the long - time evolution . 
 figure 7(c ) and ( d ) show the poincar section of the semiquantal trajectories for a polychromatically perturbed double - well system with @xmath87 ( the stroboscopic plots are taken at @xmath94 again ) . 
 the semiquantal trajectories for the squeezed quantum coherent state can be obtained by an effective action which includes partial quantum fluctuation to all order in @xmath95 @xcite . 
 it can be seen that in comparing with ones of classical dynamics the trajectories in the semiquantal dynamics spreads into the opposite well even for the small @xmath8 . 
 this corresponds to the quantum tunneling phenomenon through the semiquantal dynamics . 
 apparently , the partial quantum fluctuation in the semiquantal approximation enhances the the chaotic behavior . 
 notice that the semiquantal picture breaks down for the irregular quantum states because the centroid motion becomes irrelevant .    in fig.8(e ) and 
 ( f ) the corresponding coherent state representation for the quantum states are shown . 
 it is directly seen that the wave packet spreads over the two - wells and the shape is not symmetric . 
 once the wave packet incoherently spreads over the space , it can not return to the initial state anymore . 
 we have confirmed that in a case without separatrix ( single - well ) , namely the case that @xmath10 in eq . 
 ( 2 ) is replaced by @xmath96 , in the classical phase space the coherent oscillations have remained against the relatively large @xmath0 and/or @xmath8 . 
 it follows that the full quantum interference suppresses the chaotic behavior as seen in the semiquantual trajectories . 
 we numerically investigated influence of a polychromatic perturbation on wave packet dynamics in one - dimensional double - well potential . 
 the calculated physical quantities are the transition rate @xmath26 , the time - fluctuation @xmath40 , uncertainty product @xmath77 and phase space portrait . 
 the results we obtained in the present investigation are summarized as follows . 
 \(1 ) we classified the motions in the parameter space spanned by the amplitude and the number of frequency components of the oscillatory driving force , i.e. _ coherent motions _ and _ irregular motions_. the critical value @xmath52 which divides the behavior of @xmath26 into regular and irregular motions depends on the number of the frequency component @xmath0 . 
 \(2 ) within the regular motion range , the period of the tunneling oscillation is reduced with increase of the number of colors and/or strength of the perturbation . it could be explained by the increase of the instanton tunneling rate due to appearance of the stochastic layer near separatrix @xcite . in this parameter regime 
 the perturbed instanton picture is one of expression for chaos - assisted tunneling @xcite and chaos - assisted ionization picture reported for some quantum chaos systems @xcite . 
 \(3 ) in the irregular motion in the polychromatically perturbed cases , the growth of @xmath77 initially increases and saturates at certain level due to quantum interference . on the other hand , 
 in the stochastically perturbed case the uncertainty product grows unboundedly because the external stochasticity breaks the quantum interference in the internal dynamics . 
 the growth of @xmath77 is strongly related to the growth of the energy of the wave packet . 
 \(4 ) it is expected that the quantum fluctuation are always large for the classically chaotic trajectories compared to the regular ones . 
 this implies that the quantum corrections to the evolution of the phase space fluctuation become more dominant for classically chaotic trajectories . 
 \(5 ) in the semiquantal approximation the partial quantum fluctuation enhances the chaotic behavior , and simultaneously the chaos enhances the tunneling and decoherence of the wave packet . 
 the quantum fluctuation observed in the semiquantal picture is suppressed by interference effect in the fully quantum motion . 
 the semiquantal picture can not apply to the chaos - induced delocalized states . 
 furthermore , in the appendices , we gave classical phase space portraits in the polychromatically perturbed double - well system and a simple explanation for the perturbed instanton tunneling picture for the reduction of the tunneling period in the coherent motion regime . 
 although we have dealt with quantum dynamics of wave packet with paying attention to existence of the energetic barrier , we can expect that the similar phenomena would appear by dynamical barrier in the system . 
 the details will be given elsewhere @xcite . 
 we show classical stroboscopic phase space portrait in this appendix with paying an attention to the effect of polychromatic perturbation on the chaotic behavior . in the classical dynamics , 
 such a system shows chaotic behavior by the oscillatory force @xmath97 @xcite . 
 the newton s equation of the motion is @xmath98 note that in the monochromatically perturbed case ( @xmath12 , @xmath99 , the equation is known as nonlinear mathieu equation which can be derived from surface acoustic wave in piezoelectric solid @xcite and nanomechanical amplifier in micronscale devices @xcite .      in fig . 
 a.1 , we show the change of the classical stroboscopic phase space portrait changing the perturbation parameters . 
 increasing the perturbation strength @xmath8 destroys the separatrix and forms a chaotic layer in the vicinity of the separatrix . 
 needless to say , the phenomena have been observed even in the monochromatically perturbed cases @xcite . in the polychromatically perturbed cases ( @xmath100 ) 
 the smaller the strength @xmath8 can generate chaotic behavior of the classical trajectories the larger @xmath0 is @xcite . 
 it should be emphasized that in the polychromatically perturbed cases the width of the chaotic layer grows faster than the monochromatically perturbed case as the perturbation strength increases . as a result , the increase of the color contributes the increase of the width of the stochastic layer in the polychromatically perturbed cases .    ) 
 space are plotted at @xmath101 . 
 the @xmath56dependence for @xmath102 is shown in ( a)@xmath66 , ( b)@xmath69 , ( c)@xmath28 and ( d)@xmath29 . 
 the @xmath103dependence for @xmath104 is shown in ( e)@xmath12 , ( f)@xmath55 , ( g)@xmath102 and ( h)@xmath105 . ]    here , we use the increasing rate of infinitesimal displacement along the classical trajectory for the extent of chaotic behavior as a finite - time lyapunov exponent @xmath106 . 
 we prepare various initial points in the phase space , and conveniently adapt a trajectory with maximal increasing rate among the ensemble within the finite - time interval as the finite - time lyapunov exponent . 
 note that an exact lyapunov exponent should be defined for the long - time limit . 
 however , the roughly estimated lyapunov exponent is also useful to observe the classical - quantum correspondence . 
 figure a.2 shows the @xmath56dependence of classical lyapunov exponents for various cases estimated by the numerical data of the classical trajectories . 
 estimated by some classical trajectories within the finite - time @xmath107 $ ] , where @xmath108 is tunneling time given insubsect.3.1 . ] 
 we can roughly observe a transition from motion of kam system ( @xmath109 ) to chaotic motion ( @xmath110 ) as the perturbation strength increases . 
 the increasing of the number of color @xmath0 reduces the value of the critical perturbation strength @xmath111 of a transition from a motion of kam system to fully chaotic motion . roughly speaking 
 , a transition of the classical dynamics corresponds to the transition from coherent motion to irregular one in the quantum dynamics . 
 we expect that the transition observed in sect.3 will corresponds to quantum signatures of the kam transition from the regular to chaotic dynamics .      in this subsection 
 , we conceptually consider a role of the polychromatic perturbation different from monochromatic one . 
 note that the change of the number @xmath0 of colors also changes the qualitative nature of the underlying dynamics because @xmath0 corresponds to the effective number of dof under some conditions @xcite . in the our model , when the number of dof of the total system is more than four , i.e. @xmath112 , the classical trajectories can diffuse along the stochastic layers of many resonances that cover the whole phase space if the trajectory starts in the vicinity of a nonlinear resonance . 
 the number of resonances increases rapidly with dof , changing the characteristic of population transfer from bounded to diffusive . 
 such a global instability is known as arnold diffusion in nonlinear hamiltonian system with many dof @xcite . 
 the effect of arnold diffusion in quantum system is not trivial and the study just has started recently @xcite . 
 the more detail is out of scope of this paper . 
 moreover , we can regard the time - dependent model of eq.(1 ) as nonautonomous approximation for an autonomous model , consisting of the double - well system coupled finite number @xmath0 of harmonic oscillators with the incommensurate frequencies @xmath113 . 
 it is worth noting that the linear oscillators can be identified with a highly excited quantum harmonic oscillators , which all phonon modes are excited around fock states with large quantum numbers . 
 then the above model can be regarded as a double - well system coupled with @xmath0 phonon modes . without the interaction with 
 the phonon modes the gaussian wavepacket remains the coherent motion . 
 then the number of dof of total system is @xmath114 and the number of the frequency components @xmath0 corresponds to the that of the highly excited quantum harmonic oscillators . 
 the detail of the correspondence is given in ref.@xcite . 
 in quantum chaotic system with finite and many dof we expect occurrence of a dissipative behavior . for example , we consider simulated light absorption by coupling a system in the ground state with radiation field . then stationary one - way energy transport from photon source to the system can be interpreted as occurrence of quantum irreversibility in the total system . 
 such a irreversibility is called chaos - induced dissipation in quantum system with more than two dof @xcite . in this sense 
 , we can expect occurrence of the one - way transport phenomenon in the delocalized state in the irregular motion phase if it couples with the other dof in the ground state as seen in ref.@xcite . 
 in this appendix , we consider the reduction of the tunneling period as the perturbation strength increases in the coherent oscilation regime @xmath65 , based on a perturbed instanton tunneling . in a double - well system with dipole - type interaction , @xmath115 , the energitical barrier tunneling between the symmetric double - well 
 can be explained by a three - state model or chaos - assisted tunneling ( cat ) @xcite . 
 the three states that take part in the tunneling are a doublet of quasi - degenerate states with opposite parity , localized in the each well , and a third state localized in the chaotic layer around the separatrix . 
 however , note that less attention has been paid to tunneling in kam system while chaotic dynamics has been modeled by multi - level hamiltonian and random matrix model to describe the chaos - assisted tunneling . 
 we give an expresion of the tunneling amplitude in `` chaos - assisted instanton tunneling '' firstly proposed by kuvshinov _ 
 et al _ for a hamiltonian system with time - periodic perturbation @xcite . 
 let us consider only monochromatically perturbed case ( @xmath12 in eq.(2 ) , @xmath116 ) because the separatrix destruction mechanism by the time - periodic perturbation has an universality although our system is different from their one . . 
 indeed , trajectories in the neighborhood of the separatrix of the system are well reproduced by the whisker map of the system . 
 whisker map is a map of the energy change @xmath117 and phase change @xmath118 of a trajectory in the neighborhood of the separatrix for each of its motion during one period of the perturbation , i.e. action - angle variable . 
 moreover , if we linearize the whisker map which describes the behaviors of the trajectories in the neighborhood of the fixed point , we can obtain the following standard map , @xmath119 , where @xmath120 is a nonlinear parameter of local instability that the exact function form which is not essential for our purpose . @xmath121 increases with @xmath8 , and @xmath122 means that the dynamics of the system is locally unstable . 
 a comparison has done between the whisker map and the strobe plots in the time continuous version by yamaguchi @xcite . 
 the form of the mapping is convenient for the estimate of the width of the stochastic layer . 
 the perturbation destroys separatrix of the unperturbed system and the stochastic layer appears . in the regular motion denoted by the circles in fig.3 , classical chaos can increase the rate of instanton tunneling due to appearance of the stochastic layer near separatrix of the unperturbed system . as a result 
 the frequency of time - dependence @xmath26 increases as the classical chaos becomes remarkable in the parameter regime . 
 note that the perturbed instanton tunneling picture disappears in the strongly perturbed regime due to the delocalization of wavepacket .    here 
 we give only relation between the width of the stochastic layer and the tunneling amplitude in terms of path integral in imaginary time @xmath123 , found by kuvshivov _ 
 et al_. tunneling amplitude between the two wells in the perturbed system can be given by integration over energy of tunneling amplitude @xmath124 in unperturbed system as , @xmath125 \exp\ { -s[q(\tau , e ) ] \ } , \end{aligned}\ ] ] where @xmath126 $ ] denotes the euclidian action . 
 @xmath127 denotes the width of stochastic layer , where @xmath128 and @xmath129 are the energy of the unperturbed system on the separatrix and on the bound of stochastic layer , respectively . 
 @xmath130 is classical solution of euclidian equation of motion . 
 the contribution of the chaotic instanton solution are taken into account by means of integration over @xmath131 which is energy of the instanton . 
 the perturbed instanton solutions correspond to the motions in vicinity of the separatrix inside the layer . 
 the only manifestation of the perturbation in this approximation is the appearance of a number of additional solutions of the euclidian equation of motion with energy close to the energy of the unperturbed one - instanton solution inside the stochastic layer . 
 accordingly , we can expect that the appearance of the stochastic layer enhances the tunneling rate as reported in the other systems @xcite . 
 however , we have to have in mind that the result is obtained in the first order on coupling constant @xmath8 of the time - periodic perturbation and does not take into account the structure of stochastic layer . 
 the approximation is valid if the layer is narrow by neglecting the higher order resonances in the phase space . for the more details of the perturbed instanton see ref.@xcite . 
 the increasing of the tunneling amplitude is directly related to energy splitting @xmath63 between the quasi - degenerate ground floquet states . 
 as seen in fig.a.1 , the increasing of number of color @xmath0 can enhance the width of the stochastic layer with the perturbation strength being kept at a constant value . 
 the theoretical explanation for the reduction of the tunneling period with the number of color is open for further study . 
 we expect that in the double - well system under the polychromatic perturbation this numerical study will be useful for the analytical derivation of `` reduction of tunneling period '' and `` critical strength of a transition from localized to delocalized behavior of wavepacket '' by extension of the monochromatically perturbed case . 
 the chaos assisted instanton theory might be applicable if we will exactly estimate the width of the stochastic layer in the system under the polychromatic perturbation . 
 it should be noted that the uncertainty product is not always good measure of quantum fluctuation because it does not correspond to the real area ( or volume ) of phase space . 
 however , we would like to pay attention to the initial growth and the mean value during the time - evolution process instead of the detail of the definition of the exact quantum fluctuation in the dynamics . 
 practically , the @xmath132 remains small thorough the regular instanton - like motion , on the other hand , it shows sharp increase and the large value remains for the strongly chaotic cases .

 the classical chaos enhances quantum fluctuation in the restricted sense .","we numerically study influence of a polychromatic perturbation on wave packet dynamics in one - dimensional double - well potential . it is found that time - dependence of the transition probability between the wells shows two kinds of the motion typically , coherent oscillation and irregular fluctuation combined to the delocalization of the wave packet , depending on the perturbation parameters . 
 the coherent motion changes the irregular one as the strength and/or the number of frequency components of the perturbation increases . 
 we discuss a relation between our model and decoherence in comparing with the result under stochastic perturbation . 
 furthermore we compare the quantum fluctuation , tunneling in the quantum dynamics with ones in the semiquantal dynamics .",arxiv
"[ secintro ] dyadic data are common in psychosocial and behavioral studies [ @xcite ] . 
 many social phenomena , such as dating and marital relationships , are interpersonal by definition , and , as a result , related observations do not refer to a single person but rather to both persons involved in the dyadic relationship . members of dyads often influence each other s cognitions , emotions and behaviors , which leads to interdependence in a relationship . 
 for example , a husband s ( or wife s ) drinking behavior may lead to lowered marital satisfaction for the wife ( or husband ) . 
 a consequence of interdependence is that observations of the two individuals are correlated . 
 for example , the marital satisfaction scores of husbands and wives tend to be positively correlated . 
 one of the primary objectives of relationship research is to understand the interdependence of individuals within dyads and how the attributes and behaviors of one dyad member impact the outcome of the other dyad member .    in many studies , 
 dyadic outcomes are measured over time , resulting in longitudinal dyadic data . 
 repeatedly measuring dyads brings in two complications . 
 first , in addition to the within - dyad correlation , repeated measures on each subject are also correlated , that is , within - subject correlation . when analyzing longitudinal dyadic data , it is important to account for these two types of correlations simultaneously ; otherwise , the analysis results may be invalid . 
 the second complication is that longitudinal dyadic data are prone to the missing data problem caused by dropout , whereby subjects are lost to follow - up and their responses are not observed thereafter . in psychosocial dyadic studies , 
 the dropouts are often nonignorable or informative in the sense that the dropout depends on missing values . in the presence of the nonignorable dropouts 
 , conventional statistical methods may be invalid and lead to severely biased estimates [ @xcite ] . 
 there is extensive literature on statistical modeling of nonignorable dropouts in longitudinal studies . based on different factorizations of the likelihood of the outcome process and 
 the dropout process , @xcite identified two broad classes of likelihood - based nonignorable models : selection models [ @xcite ; @xcite ; follman and wu ( @xcite ) ; @xcite ] and pattern mixture models [ @xcite ; little ( @xcite , @xcite ) ; hogan and laird ( @xcite ) ; @xcite ; @xcite ] . 
 other likelihood - based approaches that do not directly belong to this classification have also been proposed in the literature , for example , the mixed - effects hybrid model by @xcite and a class of nonignorable models by @xcite . 
 another general approach for dealing with nonignorable dropouts is based on estimation equations and includes @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite . 
 recent reviews of methods handling nonignorable dropouts in longitudinal data can be found in @xcite , @xcite , little ( @xcite ) , @xcite and @xcite . in spite of the rich body of literature noted above , to the best of our knowledge 
 , the nonignorable dropout problem has not been addressed in the context of longitudinal dyadic data . 
 the interdependence structure within dyads brings new challenges to this missing data problem . 
 for example , within dyads , one member s outcome often depends on his / her covariates , as well as the other member s outcome and covariates . 
 thus , the dropout of the other member in the dyad causes not only a missing ( outcome ) data problem for that member , but also a  missing ( covariate ) data problem for the member who remains in the study.=-1    we propose a fully bayesian approach to deal with longitudinal dyadic data with nonignorable dropouts based on a selection model . 
 specifically , we model each subject s longitudinal measurement process using a transition model , which includes both the patient s and spouse s characteristics as covariates in order to capture the interdependence between patients and their spouses . 
 we account for the within - dyad correlation by introducing dyad - specific random effects into the transition model . to accommodate the nonignorable dropouts , we take the selection model approach by directly modeling the relationship between the dropout process and missing outcomes using a discrete time survival model .    the remainder of the article is organized as follows . in section  [ sec2 ] 
 we describe our motivating data collected from a longitudinal dyadic breast cancer study . in section  [ sec3 ] 
 we propose a bayesian selection - model - based approach for longitudinal dyad data with informative nonresponse , and provide estimation procedures using a gibbs sampler in section  [ sec4 ] . in section  [ sec5 ] we present simulation studies to evaluate the performance of the proposed method . in section  [ sec6 ] we illustrate our method by analyzing a breast cancer data set and we provide conclusions in section  [ sec7 ] . 
 our research is motivated by a single - arm dyadic study focusing on physiological and psychosocial aspects of pain among patients with breast cancer and their spouses [ @xcite ] . for individuals with breast cancer , spouses are most commonly reported as being the primary sources of support [ @xcite ] , and spousal support is associated with lower emotional distress and depressive symptoms in these patients [ @xcite ] . 
 one specific aim of the study is to characterize the depression experience due to metastatic breast cancer from both patients and spouses perspectives , and examine the dyadic interaction and interdependence of patients and spouses over time regarding their depression . 
 the results will be used to guide the design of an efficient prevention program to decrease depression among patients . 
 for example , conventional prevention programs typically apply interventions to patients directly . 
 however , if we find that the patient s depression depends on both her own and spouse s previous depression history and chronic pain , when designing a prevention program to improve the depression management and pain relief , we may achieve better outcomes by targeting both patients and spouses simultaneously rather than targeting patients only . in this study 
 ,    female patients who had initiated metastatic breast cancer treatment were approached by the project staff . 
 patients meeting the eligibility criteria ( e.g. , speak english , experience pain due to the breast cancer , having a male spouse or significant other , be able to carry on pre - disease performance , be able to provide informed consent ) were asked to participate the study on a voluntary basis . 
 the participation of the study would not affect their treatment in any way . 
 depression in patients and spouse was measured at three time points ( baseline , 3 months and 6 months ) using the center for epidemiologic studies depression scale ( cesd ) questionnaires . 
 however , a substantial number of dropouts occurred . 
 baseline cesd measurements were collected from 191 couples ; however , at 3 months , 101 couples ( 105 patients and 107 spouses ) completed questionnaires , and at 6 months , 73 couples ( 76 patients and 79 spouses ) completed questionnaires . 
 the missingness of the cesd measurements is likely related to the current depression levels of the patients or spouses , thus an nonignorable missing data mechanism is assumed for this study . 
 consequently , it is important to account for the nonignorable dropouts in this data analysis ; otherwise , the results may be biased , as we will show in section  [ sec6 ] . 
 consider a longitudinal dyadic study designed to collect @xmath0 repeated measurements of a response @xmath1 and a vector of covariates @xmath2 for each of @xmath3 dyads . 
 let @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 denote the outcome , @xmath7 covariate vector and outcome history , respectively , for the member @xmath8 of dyad @xmath9 at the @xmath10th measurement time with @xmath11 . 
 we assume that @xmath2 is fully observed ( e.g. , is external or fixed by study design ) , but @xmath1 is subject to missingness due to dropout . 
 the random variable  @xmath12 , taking values from @xmath13 to @xmath14 , indicates the time the member @xmath8 of the @xmath9th dyad drops out , where @xmath15 if the subject completes the study , and @xmath16 if the subject drops out between the @xmath17th and @xmath10th measurement time , that is , @xmath18 are observed and @xmath19 are missing . 
 we assume at least 1 observation for each subject , as subjects without any observations have no information and are often excluded from the analysis .    when modeling longitudinal dyadic data , we need to consider two types of correlations : the within - subject correlation due to repeated measures on a subject , and the within - dyad correlation due to the dyadic structure 
 . we account for the first type of correlation by a transition model , and the second type of correlation by dyad - specific random effects @xmath20 , as follows : @xmath21 
 regression parameters in this random - effects transition model have intuitive interpretations similar to those of the actor  partner interdependence model , a conceptual framework proposed by @xcite to study dyadic relationships in the social sciences and behavior research fields . 
 specifically ,  @xmath22 and @xmath23 represent the `` actor '' effects of the patient , which indicate how the covariates and the outcome history of the patient ( i.e. , @xmath24 and @xmath25 ) affect her own current outcome , whereas @xmath26 and @xmath27 represent the `` partner '' effects for the patient , which indicate how the covariates and the outcome history of the spouse ( i.e. , @xmath28 and @xmath29 ) affect the outcome of the patient . similarly , @xmath30 and @xmath31 characterize the actor effects and @xmath32 and @xmath33 characterize the partner effects for the spouse of the patient . 
 estimates of the actor and partner effects provide important information about the interdependence within dyads . 
 we assume that residuals @xmath34 and @xmath35 are independent and follow normal distributions @xmath36 and @xmath37 , respectively ; and @xmath34 and @xmath35 are independent of random effects @xmath20 s . the parameters @xmath38 and @xmath39 are intercepts for the patients and spouses , respectively .    in many situations , 
 the conditional distribution of @xmath4 given @xmath40 and  @xmath5 depends only on the @xmath41 prior outcomes @xmath42 and @xmath5 . 
 if this is the case , we obtain the so - called @xmath41th - order transition model , a type of transition model that is most useful in practice [ @xcite ] . 
 the choice of the model order @xmath41 depends on subject matters . in many applications , 
 it is often reasonable to set @xmath43 when the current outcome depends on only the last observed previous outcome , leading to commonly used markov models . the likelihood ratio test can be used to assess whether a specific value of  @xmath41 is appropriate [ @xcite ] . 
 auto - correlation analysis of the outcome history also can provide useful information to determine the value of @xmath41 [ @xcite ; @xcite ] . 
 define @xmath44 and @xmath45 for @xmath46 . given \{@xmath47 and the random effect @xmath20 , the joint log likelihood of @xmath48 for the @xmath9th dyad under the @xmath41th - order ( random - effects ) transition model 
 is given by @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the likelihood corresponding to model ( [ transition ] ) , and @xmath51 is assumed free of @xmath52 , for @xmath46 . 
 an important feature of model ( [ transition ] ) that distinguishes it from the standard transition model is that the current value of the outcome @xmath1 depends on not only the subject s outcome history , but also the spouse s outcome history . 
 such a `` partner '' effect is of particular interest in dyadic studies because it reflects the interdependence between the patients and spouses . 
 this interdependence within dyads also makes the missing data problem more challenging . 
 consider a dyad consisting of subjects @xmath53 and  @xmath54 and that  @xmath54 drops out prematurely . because the outcome history of @xmath54 is used as a  covariate in the transition model of @xmath53 , when @xmath54 drops out , we face not only the missing outcome ( for @xmath54 ) but also missing covariates ( for @xmath53 ) . 
 we address this dual missing data problem using the data augmentation approach , as described in section  [ sec4 ] .    to account for nonignorable dropouts , 
 we employ the discrete time survival model [ @xcite ] to jointly model the missing data mechanism . 
 specifically , we assume that the distribution of @xmath12 depends on both the past history of the longitudinal process and the current outcome @xmath4 , but not on future observations . 
 define the discrete hazard rate @xmath55 . 
 it follows that the probability of dropout for the member @xmath8 in the @xmath9th dyad is given by @xmath56    we specify the discrete hazard rate @xmath57 using the logistic regression model : @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the random effect accounting for the within - dyadic correlation , and @xmath60 and @xmath61 are unknown parameters . in this dropout model 
 , we assume that , conditioning on the random effects , a subject s covariates , past history and current ( unobserved ) outcome , the dropout probability of this subject is independent of the characteristics and outcomes of the other member in the dyad . 
 the spouse may indirectly affect the dropout rate of the patient through influencing the patient s depression status ; however , when conditional on the patient s depression score , the dropout of the patient does not depend on her spouse s depression score .    in practice 
 , we often expect that , given @xmath4 and @xmath62 , the conditional dependence of @xmath12 on @xmath63 will be negligible because , temporally , the patient s ( current ) decision of dropout is mostly driven by his ( or her ) current and the most recent outcome statuses . using the breast cancer study as an example , we do not expect that the early history of depression plays an important role for the patient s current decision of dropout ; instead , the patient drops out typically because she is currently experiencing or most recently experienced high depression . 
 the early history may influence the dropout but mainly through its effects on the current depression status . 
 once conditioning on the current and the most recent depression statuses , the influence from the early history is essentially negligible . 
 thus , we use a  simpler form of the discrete hazard model @xmath64 
 [ secestimation ] under the bayesian paradigm , we assign the following vague priors to the unknown parameters and fit the proposed model using a gibbs sampler : @xmath65 where @xmath66 denote an inverse gamma distribution with a shape parameter @xmath67 and a scale parameter @xmath68 . 
 we set @xmath67 and @xmath68 at smaller values , such as 0.1 , so that the data dominate the prior information . 
 let @xmath69 and @xmath70 denote the observed and missing part of the data , respectively . 
 considering the @xmath8th iteration of the gibbs sampler , the first step of the iteration is `` data augmentation '' [ @xcite ] , in which the missing data  @xmath70 are generated from their full conditional distributions . without loss of generality , 
 suppose for the @xmath9th dyad , member 2 drops out of the study no later than member 1 , that is , @xmath71 , and let @xmath72 . 
 assuming a  first - order ( @xmath73 ) transition model ( or markov model ) and letting @xmath74 denote a  generic symbol that represents the values of all other model parameters , the data augmentation consists of the following 3 steps :    for @xmath75 , draw @xmath76 from the conditional distribution @xmath77 where @xmath78    draw @xmath79 from the conditional distribution @xmath80    draw @xmath81 from the conditional distribution @xmath82    now , with the augmented complete data @xmath83 , the parameters are drawn alternatively as follows :    for @xmath84 , draw random effects @xmath20 from the conditional distribution @xmath85 where @xmath86    draw @xmath87 from the conditional distribution @xmath88 where @xmath89    draw @xmath90 from the conditional distribution @xmath91    draw @xmath92 from the normal distribution @xmath93 where @xmath94 and @xmath95    similarly , draw @xmath96 from the conditional distribution @xmath97 where @xmath98 and @xmath99 are defined in a similar way to @xmath100 and @xmath101    draw @xmath102 and @xmath103 from the conditional distributions @xmath104 
 draw random effects @xmath59 from the conditional distribution @xmath105    draw @xmath106 from the conditional distribution @xmath107 
 [ secsimu ]    we conducted two simulation studies ( a and b ) . 
 simulation a consists of 500 data sets , each with 200 dyads and three repeated measures . for the @xmath9th dyad 
 , we generated the first measurements ,  @xmath108 and @xmath109 , from normal distributions @xmath110 and @xmath111 , respectively , and generated the second and third measurements based on the following random - effects transition model : @xmath112 where @xmath113 , @xmath114 , @xmath115 , and covariates  @xmath116 and @xmath117 were generated independently from @xmath118 . 
 we assumed that the baseline ( first ) measurements @xmath108 and @xmath109 were observed for all subjects , and the hazard of dropout at the second and third measurement times depended on the current and last observed values of @xmath1 , that is , @xmath119 under this dropout model , on average , 24% ( 12% of member 1 and 13% of member 2 ) of the dyads dropped out at the second time point and 45% ( 26% of member  1 and 30% of member  2 ) dropped out at the third measurement time . 
 we applied the proposed method to the simulated data sets . 
 we used 1,000 iterations to burn in and made inference based on 10,000 posterior draws . for comparison purposes 
 , we also conducted complete - case and available - case analyses . 
 the complete - case analysis was based on the data from dyads who completed the follow - up , and the available - case analysis was based on all observed data ( without considering the missing data mechanism ) .

 we can see that the proposed method substantially outperformed the complete - case and available - case analyses . 
 our method yielded estimates with smaller bias and coverage rates close to the 95% nominal level . 
 in contrast , the complete - case and available - case analyses often led to larger bias and poor coverage rates . 
 for example , the bias of the estimate of @xmath122 under the complete - case and available - case analyses were @xmath128 and @xmath129 , respectively , substantially larger than that under the proposed method ( i.e. , 0.05 ) ; the coverage rate using the proposed method was about 94% , whereas those using the complete - case and available - case analyses were under 82% . 
 the second simulation study ( simulation b ) was designed to evaluate the performance of the proposed method when the nonignorable missing data mechanism is misspecified , for example , data actually are missing at random ( mar ) . 
 we generated the first measurements , @xmath108 and @xmath109 , from normal distribution @xmath130 independently , and generated the second and third measurements based on the same transition model as in simulation a. we assumed the hazard of dropout at the second and third measurement times depended on the previous ( observed ) value of @xmath1 quadratically , but not on the current ( missing ) value of @xmath1 , that is , @xmath131 under this mar dropout model , on average , 37% ( 21% of member 1 and 21% of member 2 ) of the dyads dropped out at the second time point and 27% ( 24% of member 1 and 33% of member 2 ) dropped out at the third measurement time . to fit the simulated data , we considered two nonignorable models with different specifications of the dropout ( or selection ) model . 
 the first nonignorable model assumed a flexible dropout model @xmath132 which included the true dropout process ( [ simu2 ] ) as a specific case with @xmath133 ; and the second nonignorable model took a misspecified dropout model of the form @xmath134    table [ simulationc ] shows the bias , standard error and coverage rate of the 95% ci under different approaches . 
 when the missing data were mar , the complete - case analysis was invalid and led to biased estimates and poor coverage rates because the complete cases are not random samples from the original population . 
 in contrast , the available - case analysis yielded unbiased estimates and coverage rates close to the 95% nominal level . 
 for the nonignorable models , the one with the flexible dropout model yielded unbiased estimates and reasonable coverage rates , whereas the model with the misspecified dropout model led to biased estimates ( e.g. , @xmath135 and @xmath136 ) and poor coverage rates . 
 this result is not surprising because it is well known that selection models are sensitive to the misspecification of the dropout model [ @xcite ; @xcite ] . for nonignorable missing data , 
 the difficulty is that we can not judge whether a specific dropout model is misspecified or not based solely on observed data because the observed data contain no information about the ( nonignorable ) missing data mechanism . to address this difficulty , 
 one possible approach is to specify a flexible dropout model to decrease the chance of model misspecification . 
 alternatively , maybe a better approach is to conduct sensitivity analysis to evaluate how the results vary when the dropout model varies . 
 we will illustrate the latter approach in the next section .

 [ secapplication ]    we applied our method to the longitudinal metastatic breast cancer data . 
 we used the first - order random - effects transition model for the longitudinal measurement process . in the model 
 , we included 5 covariates : chronic pain measured by the multidimensional pain inventory ( mpi ) and previous cesd scores from both the patients and spouses , and the patient s stage of cancer . in the discrete - time dropout model 
 , we included the subject s current and previous cesd scores , mpi measurements and the patient s stage of cancer as covariates . 
 age was excluded from the models because its estimate was very close to 0 and not significant . 
 we used 5,000 iterations to burn in and made inference based on 5,000 posterior draws . 
 we also conducted the complete - case and available - case analyses for the purpose of comparison .

 the spouse s depression correlates with his previous cesd scores but not the mpi level , whereas the patient s depression is related to both variables . 
 based on these results , we can see that the patients and spouses are highly interdependent and influence each other s depression status . 
 therefore , when designing a prevention program to reduce depression in patients , we may achieve better outcomes by targeting both patients and spouses simultaneously . 
 as for the dropout process , the results in table  [ tab4 ] suggest that the missing data for the patients are nonignorable because the probability of dropout is significantly associated with the patient s current ( missing ) cesd score . 
 in contrast , the missing data for the spouse appears to be ignorable , as the probability of dropout does not depend on the spouse s current ( missing ) cesd score . for the variance components , the estimates of residuals variances for patients and spouses are @xmath141 [ 95% @xmath142 and @xmath143 [ 95% @xmath144 , respectively 
 . the estimates of the variances for the random effects    @xmath20 and @xmath59 are @xmath145 [ 95% @xmath146 and @xmath147 [ 95% @xmath148 , respectively , suggesting substantial variations across dyads . 
 compared to the proposed approach , both the complete - case and available - case analyses fail to detect some `` partner '' effects . for example , for spouses , the complete - case and available - case analyses assert that the spouse s cesd is correlated with his own previous cesd scores only , whereas the proposed method suggested that the spouse s cesd is related not only to his own cesd but also to the patient s cesd and mpi level . 
 in addition , for patients , the `` partner '' effect of the spouse s cesd is not significant under the complete - case and available - case analyses , but is significant under the proposed approach . 
 these results suggest that ignoring the nonignorable dropouts could lead to a failure to detect important covariate effects . 
 nonidentifiability is a common problem when modeling nonignorable missing data . in our approach , 
 the observed data contain very limited information on the parameters that link the missing outcome with the dropout process , that is , @xmath149 and @xmath150 in the dropout model . 
 the identification of these parameters is heavily driven by the untestable model assumptions [ @xcite ; @xcite ] . in this case 
 , a sensible strategy is to perform a sensitivity analysis to examine how the inference changes with respect to the values of @xmath151 and @xmath152 [ daniels and hogan ( @xcite , @xcite ) ; @xcite ] . 
 we conducted a bayesian sensitivity analysis by assuming informative normal prior distributions for @xmath149 and @xmath153 with a small variance of 0.01 and the mean fixed , successively , at various values . 
 figures [ figsensitivitygibbs1 ] and [ figsensitivitygibbs2 ] show the parameter estimates of the measurement models when the prior means of @xmath149 and @xmath150 vary from @xmath154 to 3 . 
 in general , the estimates were quite stable , except that the estimate of cancer stage in the measurement model of patient ( figure [ figsensitivitygibbs1 ] ) and the estimate of spouse s mpi in the measurement model of spouse ( figure [ figsensitivitygibbs2 ] ) demonstrated some variations .     and @xmath150 with a mean varying from @xmath154 to 3 and a fixed variance of 0.01 . ] 
 [ fig1 ]     and @xmath150 with a mean varying from @xmath154 to 3 and a fixed variance of 0.01 . ]    [ fig2 ]    we conducted another sensitivity analysis on the prior distributions of  @xmath155 , @xmath156 , @xmath90 and @xmath106 . 
 we considered various inverse gamma priors , @xmath157 , by setting @xmath158 and 5 . 
 as shown in table [ tablepriorvar ] , the estimates of the measurement model parameters were stable under different prior distributions , suggesting the proposed method is not sensitive to the priors of these parameters . 
 [ seccon ] we have developed a selection - model - based approach to analyze longitudinal dyadic data with nonignorable dropouts . 
 we model the longitudinal outcome process using a transition model and account for the correlation within dyads using random effects . in the model , we allow a  subject s outcome to depend on not only his / her own characteristics but also the characteristics of the other member in the dyad . as a  result , 
 the parameters of the proposed model have appealing interpretations as `` actor '' and `` partner '' effects , which greatly facilitates the understanding of interdependence within a relationship and the design of more efficient prevention programs . to account for the nonignorable dropout 
 , we adopt a  discrete time survival model to link the dropout process with the longitudinal measurement process . 
 we used the data augment method to address the complex missing data problem caused by dropout and interdependence within dyads . 
 the simulation study shows that the proposed method yields consistent estimates with correct coverage rates . 
 we apply our methodology to the longitudinal dyadic data collected from a breast cancer study . 
 our method identifies more `` partner '' effects than the methods that ignore the missing data , thereby providing extra insights into the interdependence of the dyads . 
 for example , the methods that ignore the missing data suggest that the spouse s cesd related only to his own previous cesd scores , whereas the proposed method suggested that the spouse s cesd related not only to his own cesd but also to the patient s cesd and mpi level 
 . this extra information can be useful for the design of more efficient depression prevention programs for breast cancer patients .

 a more flexible approach is to include in the model a time - dependent random effect @xmath160 to represent all unmeasured time - variant factors that influence dropout . 
 we can further put a hierarchical structure on @xmath160 to shrink it toward a dyad - level time - invariant random effect @xmath59 to account for the effects of unmeasured time - invariance factors on dropout . 
 in addition , in ( [ dropmodel ] ) , in order to allow members in a dyad to drop out at different times , we specify separate dropout models for each dyadic member , linked by a common random effect . although the common random effect makes the members in a dyad more likely to drop out at the same time , it may not be the most effective modeling approach when dropout mostly occurs at the dyad level . in this case 
 , a more effective approach is that , in addition to the dyad - level random effect , we further put hierarchical structure on the coefficients of common covariates ( in the two dropout models ) to shrink toward a common value to reflect that dropout is almost always at the dyad level . 
 we would like to thank the referees , associate editor and editor ( professor susan paddock ) for very helpful comments that substantially improved this paper .","dyadic data are common in the social and behavioral sciences , in which members of dyads are correlated due to the interdependence structure within dyads . 
 the analysis of longitudinal dyadic data becomes complex when nonignorable dropouts occur . 
 we propose a  fully bayesian selection - model - based approach to analyze longitudinal dyadic data with nonignorable dropouts . 
 we model repeated measures on subjects by a transition model and account for within - dyad correlations by random effects . in the model , we allow subject s outcome to depend on his / her own characteristics and measure history , as well as those of the other member in the dyad 
 . we further account for the nonignorable missing data mechanism using a selection model in which the probability of dropout depends on the missing outcome . 
 we propose a gibbs sampler algorithm to fit the model .

"there are many problems concerning electronic structure where attention is focussed on a small region of a larger system , at surfaces or defects in crystals being perhaps the most common . 
 let us call this region i , figure [ fig:1 ] , and the rest of the system region ii . 
 although not of primary interest region ii can not be ignored , since in general the electron wave functions in i will be sensitive to the contents of region ii . 
 some time ago inglesfield @xcite derived an embedding scheme which enables the single - particle schrdinger equation to be solved explicitly only in region i. the influence of region ii is taken into account exactly by adding an energy - dependent non - local potential to the hamiltonian for region i , which constrains the solutions in i to match onto solutions in ii . 
 this embedding method has been developed into a powerful tool most notably for surface electronic structure problems @xcite where it has found widespread application especially to situations where an accurate description of the spectrum of electron states is necessary . 
 examples include studies of image states @xcite , surface states at metals surfaces @xcite , static and dynamic screening @xcite , atomic adsorption and scattering at surfaces @xcite , studies of surface optical response @xcite and field emission @xcite . 
 recent applications to transport problems have also been described @xcite . for a review of the embedding method 
 see inglesfield @xcite . 
 = 80 mm    in the case of materials containing heavier elements , relativistic effects can be significant @xcite and lead to important deviations from the electronic structure as predicted by the schrdinger equation  shifts in inner core levels of 5d elements are typically several 100 or 1000 ev , valence bands shifts are on the ev scale and spin orbit splitting is often measured in tenths of ev . even ignoring the concomitant changes in electron wave functions these shifts can reorder levels and so affect calculated densities , fundamental to the determination of ground state properties within the density functional framework @xcite . 
 for this reason most of the conventional electronic structure techniques developed for accurately solving the single - particle schrdinger equation in solids have subsequently been modified to deal with the dirac equation , including the relativistic augmented plane wave method @xcite , relativistic linear muffin - tin orbital method @xcite , relativistic augmented spherical wave method @xcite and the relativistic multiple - scattering method @xcite , and each has subsequently been used in studying a diverse range of problems . 
 the last method alone has formed the basis of calculations of photoemission @xcite , magnetocrystalline anisotropy @xcite , hyperfine interactions @xcite and magnetotransport @xcite amongst other topics . 
 inglesfield s embedding method has particular advantages that encourage its extension to the relativistic case . 
 it permits the inclusion of extended substrates for surface and interface calculations , enables the study of isolated point defects in solids and being a basis set technique is highly flexible and permits full - potential studies with relative ease . at surfaces extended substrates ( as against the use of the supercell or thin - film approximation in which the crystal is approximated by a small number of layers , typically 5 - 7 ) enable the proper distinction between surface states , resonances and the continuum of bulk states @xcite . 
 the behaviour of the w(110 ) surface @xcite where the addition of half a monolayer of li is observed to _ increase _ the spin - orbit splitting of a surface state by @xmath2 ev ( resulting in fermi surface crossings separated by @xmath3% of the brillouin zone dimension ) typifies a type of problem a relativistic embedding scheme could address . 
 indeed each of the topics mentioned at the end of the previous paragraph are relevant at surfaces and/or interfaces , and could be usefully investigated within a relativistic embedding framework .    in this paper 
 we develop an embedding scheme for the dirac equation that parallels inglesfield s scheme for the schrdinger equation . 
 inglesfield s starting point is the expectation value of the hamiltonian using a trial wave function which is continuous in amplitude but discontinuous in derivative across the surface @xmath1 separating i and ii . 
 the first order nature of the dirac equation precludes the use of a similar trial function . 
 instead , in the following section we use a trial function in which the large component is continuous and the small component discontinuous across @xmath1 . 
 continuity in the small component is restored when the resulting equations are solved exactly . using the green function for region 
 ii we are able to derive an expression for the expectation value purely in terms of the trial function in i. in section [ section : app ] the application of the method is illustrated by calculating the eigenstates of a hydrogen atom within a cavity and in section [ section : green ] we determine the green function for the embedded region . 
 section [ section : monolayer ] briefly illustrates the method applied to a sandwich structure where relativistic effects are marked . 
 we conclude with a brief summary and discussion . 
 in this section we consider region i joined onto region ii ( figure [ fig:1 ] ) , and derive a variational principle for a trial wave function @xmath4 defined explicitly only within region i. we are primarily interested in the positive energy solutions of the dirac equation @xcite , and so we refer to the upper and lower spinors of the dirac bi - spinor solutions as the large and small components of the wave function respectively . 
 we notionally extend @xmath4 into ii as @xmath5 , an exact solution of the dirac equation at some energy @xmath6 , with the large components of @xmath4 and @xmath5 ( @xmath7 and @xmath8 ) matching on the surface @xmath1 separating i and ii , but with no constraint upon the small components ( @xmath9 and @xmath10 ) , figure [ fig:2 ] . 
 the expectation value for the energy @xmath11 is then @xmath12 } { \langle\varphi|\varphi\rangle_{\mathrm{i}}+ \langle\chi|\chi\rangle_{\mathrm{ii } } } \label{eqn : exp}\ ] ] where @xmath13 . 
 ( for clarity we omit the interaction @xmath14 which appears in the relativistic density functional theory @xcite neglecting orbital and displacement currents , where @xmath15 is a `` spin - only '' effective magnetic field containing an external and exchange - correlation contribution . 
 its inclusion has no consequences for the derivation . ) 
 the first two terms in the numerator are the expectation value of the hamiltonian through regions i and ii , and the third the contribution due to the discontinuity in the small component of the wave function on @xmath1 ( in this and the following , surface normals are directed from i to ii ) . 
 = 60 mm    we eliminate reference to @xmath5 by introducing two relations . 
 firstly , for @xmath16 , @xmath5 satisfies the dirac equation at energy @xmath6 @xmath17\chi=0 \label{eqn : dirii}\ ] ] and differentiating with respect to @xmath6 the energy derivative of @xmath5 , @xmath18 , satisfies @xmath19\dot{\chi}=\chi\qquad \bi{r}\in\mathrm{ii}. \label{eqn : eder}\ ] ] multiplying the hermitian conjugate of the first equation by @xmath20 from the right , multiplying the second from the left by @xmath21 , subtracting and integrating over region ii gives a relation between the normalisation of @xmath5 in ii and the amplitude on @xmath1 : @xmath22 we have assumed that @xmath5 vanishes sufficiently strongly at infinity .    for the second relation 
 we introduce the green function ( resolvant ) @xmath23 corresponding to equation ( [ eqn : dirii ] ) : @xmath24g=-\delta(\bi{r}-\bi{r } ' )   \qquad \bi{r},\bi{r}'\in \mathrm{ii}. \label{eqn : gf}\ ] ] multiplying the hermitian conjugate of this equation by @xmath5 from the right , and subtracting @xmath25 times equation ( [ eqn : dirii ] ) , integrating over region ii and then using the reciprocity of the green function gives @xmath26 we see that the green function relates the amplitude of the wave function on @xmath1 to the amplitude at any point within ii . 
 in particular , we can obtain a relation between the large and small components of @xmath5 on s. writing the @xmath27 green function as @xmath28 where each entry is a @xmath29 matrix , substituting into equation ( [ eqn : chis ] ) , and rearranging the two equations coupling the small and large components of @xmath5 gives @xmath30 where @xmath31 it follows from ( [ eqn : chis ] ) that the green functions in ( [ eqn : gam ] ) are the limiting forms of @xmath32 as @xmath33 from within ii . 
 equations ( [ eqn : norm ] ) and ( [ eqn : cgc ] ) are the desired results that enable us to express the expectation value @xmath11 in ( [ eqn : exp ] ) in terms of @xmath4 alone . 
 after substitution and use of the continuity of the large components @xmath34 on @xmath1 we obtain @xmath35 } { \langle\varphi|\varphi\rangle_{\mathrm{i}}- c^2\hbar^2 \int_s \rmd\bi{r}_s\cdot \varphi_{\rm l}^\dag \bsigma \int_s \rmd\bi{r}'_s \cdot \dot{\gamma } \bsigma\ , \varphi_{\rm l } } . 
 \label{eqn : exp2}\ ] ] this is an expression for the expectation value of the energy @xmath11 , given purely in terms of the trial function @xmath4 in region i and on the surface @xmath1 , with all details of region ii entering via @xmath36 and its energy derivative . following the convention in the non - relativistic embedding scheme we shall refer to @xmath36 as the embedding potential .    to see what this variational principle means in practice , we consider variations in @xmath37 , whereby @xmath38 } { \langle\varphi|\varphi\rangle_{\mathrm{i}}- c^2\hbar^2\int_s \rmd\bi{r}_s\cdot \varphi_{\rm l}^\dag \bsigma \int_s \rmd\bi{r}'_s \cdot \dot{\gamma } \bsigma\ , \varphi_{\rm l } } , \nonumber\\ \label{eqn : de1}\end{aligned}\ ] ] so that solutions @xmath4 stationary with respect to arbitrary variations @xmath39 satisfy @xmath40 the first expression indicates @xmath4 is a solution of the dirac equation at energy @xmath11 in region i. comparing the second with ( [ eqn : cgc ] ) shows that @xmath4 also possesses the correct relationship between large and small components on @xmath1 , the surface separating i and ii , to match onto solutions in ii . 
 the term @xmath41 provides a first order correction to @xmath42 so that the boundary condition is appropriate for energy @xmath11 .    in practice expression ( [ eqn : exp2 ] ) may be used to obtain solutions of the dirac hamiltonian by inserting a suitably parameterised trial function and varying the parameters to obtain a stationary solution . 
 this is conveniently achieved by expanding the trial solution in a finite basis of separate large and small component spinors @xmath43 + \sum_{n=1}^{n_{\rm s } } a_{{\rm s},n }   \left[\begin{array}{c}0\\ \psi_{{\rm s},n}(\bi{r})\end{array}\right ] = \left[\begin{array}{cc } \bpsi_{\rm l}(\bi{r } ) & 0 \\ 0 & \bpsi_{\rm s}(\bi{r } ) \end{array}\right ] \left [ \begin{array}{c } \bi{a}_{\rm l } \\ \bi{a}_{\rm s } \end{array } \right].\ ] ] the matrix in the final expression is @xmath44 by @xmath45 , and the column vector contains the @xmath45 coefficients . 
 substituting into ( [ eqn : exp2 ] ) we find states @xmath46 that are stationary with respect to variations in the expansion coefficients @xmath47 are then given by the eigenstates of a generalised eigenvalue problem of the form @xmath48 \left [ \begin{array}{c } \bi{a}_{\rm l } \\

 this can be avoided through the use of a kinetically balanced basis @xcite in which there is a one - to - one relationship between large and small component spinors , @xmath50 , and where the small component spinors are given by @xmath51 the upper half of the spectrum of the @xmath52 eigenstates of ( [ eqn : a1 ] ) then provide approximations to the spectrum of electronic states . 
 = 80 mm    to illustrate the application of the relativistic embedding scheme we consider a model problem of a hydrogen atom within a spherical cavity , finding bound states of the dirac equation corresponding to the potential illustrated in figure [ fig:3 ] : @xmath53 where @xmath54 and @xmath55 . 
 we choose this model as the bound states may also be found straightforwardly by alternative methods .

 the external region ii where @xmath58 is replaced by an embedding potential acting on the surface of the sphere . 
 the value of the embedding potential is most readily evaluated from equation ( [ eqn : cgc ] ) . a general solution to the dirac equation at some energy @xmath6 in region

 \label{eqn : exp3}\ ] ] eigenfunctions @xmath4 solving this equation satisfy the dirac equation within i and the relationship between small and large components on @xmath1 ( [ eqn : de2 ] ) is exact . the final column in table [ table:1 ] 
 shows the lowest two positive energy eigenvalues of ( [ eqn : exp3 ] ) , again as a function of basis set size . 
 the eigenvalues again converge from above , and by @xmath84 reproduce the exact values by at least 7 significant figures . 
 it is worth noting that with this particular basis set increasing @xmath87 much further leads to some numerical difficulties due to overcompleteness . for more accurate 
 work a more suitable basis set should be used . 
 it should also be noted that conventional finite basis set calculations using a basis satisfying kinetic balance can given eigenvalues that lie below exact limiting values by an amount of order @xmath92 @xcite , and similar behaviour is expected in this embedding scheme . 
 most practical applications of the schrdinger embedding scheme have actually used the green function of the embedded system . 
 this is a more convenient quantity when dealing with systems where the spectrum is continuous , such as at surfaces or defects in solids . 
 we therefore consider the green function for the embedded dirac system 
 .    differentiating ( [ eqn : exp2 ] ) with respect to @xmath6 shows @xmath11 is stationary when @xmath90 , as would be expected . in this case 
 stationary solutions satisfy the embedded dirac equation @xmath93 where , introducing @xmath94 , the component of @xmath95 in the direction normal to the surface @xmath1 ( from i to ii ) at @xmath96 , the additional term @xmath97 enforcing the embedding is @xmath98 . 
 \label{eqn : gf2}\end{aligned}\ ] ] the corresponding green function satisfies @xmath99 for @xmath100 . 
 a similar line of argument to that given by inglesfield @xcite for the embedded schrdinger equation shows that this green function is identical for @xmath100 to the green functions @xmath101 for the entire system i@xmath102ii . for simplicity assuming i@xmath102ii constitute a finite system so that the spectrum is discrete , the green function @xmath101 is given by @xmath103 where @xmath104 is the eigenvalue corresponding to eigenstate @xmath105 of the entire system , normalised to unity over i@xmath102ii . for a given @xmath11 , the green function solving ( [ eqn : gf3 ] ) 
 can be expanded in terms of the eigenstates @xmath106 of the corresponding homogeneous equation @xmath107 normalised to unity over i , as @xmath108 clearly @xmath109 has poles at @xmath110 . at these energies ( [ eqn : gf5 ] ) becomes the exact embedded dirac equation ( [ eqn : gf1 ] ) so as we have seen the poles will occur at eigenstates of the entire system and the spectrum of @xmath109 and @xmath101 coincide . it remains to show the poles of @xmath109 have the appropriate weight . 
 the residue of @xmath109 at @xmath111 is @xmath112 the second term in the denominator is precisely the additional factor necessary to correctly normalise the states ( see ( [ eqn : norm ] ) , ( [ eqn : cgc ] ) ) so that @xmath113 the residues of the green function of the embedded system and those of the entire system are identical . 
 hence the two green functions are identical for @xmath114 i.    for practical calculations the green function can be expanded using a double - basis of separate large and small component spinors : @xmath115{g}(w ) \left[\begin{array}{cc } \bpsi_{\rm l}(\bi{r } ' ) & 0 \\ 0 & \bpsi_{\rm s}(\bi{r } ' ) \end{array}\right]^\dag.\ ] ] the matrix elements of the matrix of coefficients @xmath116 may be found by substituting into ( [ eqn : gf3 ] ) , multiplying from the right by the vector of basis functions , multiplying from the left by the hermitian transpose of the vector of basis functions , and integrating over region @xmath117 . 
 this leads to @xmath118^{-1}\ ] ] where the overlap and hamiltonian matrices have their previous definitions ( [ eqn : h2]-[eqn : h7 ] ) with @xmath119 .    as an illustration 
 we calculate the local density of states for the confined hydrogen model at energies above @xmath120 where the spectrum is continuous . integrating over the embedded region this 
 is given by @xmath121 figure [ fig:4 ] shows the @xmath122 wave local density of states for @xmath80 , @xmath123 , calculated with varying number of basis functions . 
 the basis functions ( [ eqn : bas1 ] ) , ( [ eqn : bas2 ] ) are not particularly appropriate for representing the continuum wave solutions , and so convergence is only achieved using a relatively large set ; however the results serve to illustrate the systematic improvement that accompanies an increasing number of basis functions . 
 the local density of states shows two resonances , the precursors of bound states that exist when any of @xmath56 , @xmath124 or @xmath120 are increased sufficiently . 
 as a further example , one that provides a test of the relativistic embedding scheme when applied to a more challenging problem , we use it to calculate the local density of states on a silver monolayer in a au(001)/ag / au(001 ) sandwich structure . using the embedding scheme only the region occupied by the ag monolayer 
 is explicitly treated . 
 this is region i , with the two au halfspaces to either side entering the calculation via embedding potentials expanded on planar surfaces . 
 then , using bloch s theorem the calculation is performed within a unit cell containing one atom . 
 the full technical details will be described elsewhere , but briefly the green function at two - dimensional wave vector @xmath125 is expanded in a set of linearised augmented relativistic plane waves . 
 we use large component basis functions @xmath126\omega_\lambda(\widehat{\bi{r } } ) & & \bi{r } \in \mbox{muffin - tin } \end{array } \right.\ ] ] where @xmath127 is a pauli spinor , @xmath128 , with @xmath129 a two - dimensional reciprocal lattice vector and @xmath130 , @xmath131 and where @xmath132 exceeds the width of the embedded region ensuring variational freedom in the basis . 
 the function @xmath133 is the large component of the wavefunction that satisfies the radial dirac equation for the spherically symmetric component of the potential at some pivot energy ; @xmath134 is the energy derivative of @xmath135 . 
 the matching coefficients @xmath136 , @xmath137 ensure continuity of the basis function in amplitude and derivative at the muffin - tin radius . 
 the small component basis functions are chosen to satisfy kinetic balance . 
 overlap and hamiltonian matrix elements follow directly from these basis functions 
 . the embedding potential is obtained from ( [ eqn : cgc ] ) using the general expression for a wavefunction outside a surface at wave vector @xmath125 . 
 this gives for the embedding potential describing the left au half space @xmath138_{\bi{g}\sigma\bi{g}'\sigma'}\nonumber\\ \times \exp(\rmi(\bi{k}+\bi{g})\cdot \bi{r}_s ) \exp(-\rmi(\bi{k}+\bi{g}')\cdot \bi{r}'_s ) \,\varphi_\sigma 
 \otimes \varphi_{\sigma ' } \label{eqn : embpot}\end{aligned}\ ] ] with @xmath139 the reflection matrix @xmath140 is found using standard layer - scattering methods @xcite 
 . a similar approach may be used to obtain an embedding potential for the right half space , which unlike the non - relativistic case differs from that for the left half space . 
 figure [ fig:5 ] compares the local density of states calculated using the relativistic embedding technique for an embedded ag monolayer using embedding potentials corresponding to au(001 ) with that found for an au(001)/ag / au(001 ) sandwich geometry using relativistic scattering theory @xcite . 
 the same au and ag potentials has been used in each case , and the local density of states found within the same muffin - tin volume . 
 therefore the results obtained with the two methods should be comparable , and we find that they are indistinguishable . 
 this confirms that the embedding potential ( [ eqn : embpot ] ) imposes the correct variational constraint upon wave functions for the embedded ag monolayer so that they replicate the behaviour of an extended au(001)/ag / au(001 ) sandwich structure . 
 the inset in figure [ fig:5 ] shows the local density of states in the non - relativistic limit ( @xmath141 ) , indicating the significant relativistic effects on the electronic structure which are correctly reproduced with this dirac - embedding scheme . 
 we have outline above an embedding scheme for the dirac equation . 
 it enables the dirac equation to be solved within a limited region i when this region forms part of a larger system , i@xmath102ii . 
 region ii is replaced by an additional term added to the hamiltonian for region i , and which acts on the surface @xmath1 separating i and ii . 
 the embedding scheme is derived using a trial function in which continuity in the small component across @xmath1 is imposed variationally . 
 expanding the wave function in a basis set of separate large and small component spinors , the problem of variational collapse is avoided by using a basis satisfying kinetic balance . calculating the spectrum of a confined hydrogen atom , the method is shown to be stable and converge to the exact eigenvalues . 
 we have also derived the green function for the embedded hamiltonian and illustrated its use in the continuum regime of the same confined hydrogen system and an au / ag / au sandwich structure . 
 these are demonstration calculations 
 future applications are likely to be to defects and surfaces of materials containing heavier ( typically 5@xmath142 ) elements , within the framework of density functional theory . 
 it is worthwhile to discuss further the use of a trial function that is discontinuous in the small component , since such a wave function gives rise to a discontinuous probability density and so would normally be dismissed in quantum theory . in non - relativistic quantum mechanics 
 discontinuous trial functions are not permitted , since they possess infinite energy . 
 however the dirac equation is first order in @xmath143 and as we have seen a perfectly regular expectation value of @xmath0 results . exploiting this freedom 
 , the embedding scheme outlined above leads to solutions that are continuous in both large and small component _ only _ when the embedding potential @xmath144 is evaluated at the same energy @xmath6 as the energy @xmath11 that appears in the dirac equation itself , for then the relationship between small and large components on @xmath1 inside ( equation [ eqn : de2 ] ) and outside ( equation [ eqn : cgc ] ) coincide , the large components matching by construction . 
 this may be achieved for example via the iterative scheme used in connection with equation ( [ eqn : exp3 ] ) and the final column of table [ table:1 ] , or explicitly when determining the green function as in section [ section : green ] . 
 these are the methods in which the non - relativistic embedding scheme has been most widely used . 
 when @xmath6 and @xmath11 do not coincide , the solutions obtained via this embedding scheme will retain small components that are discontinuous across @xmath1 . 
 this may be unacceptable for certain applications , but the solutions continue to be valid approximations at least in as much as they provide estimates of the energies of the solutions of the dirac equation , and so could suffice e.g. for interpreting spectroscopic measurements . 
 this embedding scheme places no greater emphasis on a discontinuity in the small amplitude at @xmath1 than on an incorrect ( but continuous ) amplitude elsewhere within the embedded region . 
 it aims merely to optimise the energy of the state , and will retain a discontinuity in the small component if in doing so it can better ( in terms of energy ) approximate the solution inside the embedded region . in the non - relativistic embedding scheme 
 the discontinuous derivative of the trial function implies a probability current ( and electric current ) that is discontinuous across the embedding surface . 
 this is similarly unphysical , yet numerous applications such as those cited above have demonstrated the utility and accuracy of the method . indeed , there have been many applications in which this scheme has been used to determine currents and or transport properties , such as in relation to surface optical response @xcite and electron transport in electron waveguides or through domain walls @xcite . 
 the reason for the success of these calculations is that they employed schemes in which the embedding potential was evaluated at the correct energy , ensuring that the derivative of the wavefunction was continuous across @xmath1 . in practise 
 there have been few calculations using the non - relativistic embedding scheme in which the energies did not coincide . 
 there are a number of aspects of the method which are worthy of further consideration . 
 we started with a trial function in which by construction the large component was continuous and the small component discontinuous across the surface @xmath1 dividing i and ii . 
 we could have reversed these conditions , leading to a similar embedded dirac equation but with a modified embedding term . 
 the particular choice was motivated by the wish to have a theory which behaves reasonably in the limit @xmath141 when the small component becomes negligible  a discontinuous amplitude is not permissible in trial solutions to the schrdinger equation . 
 however , the behaviour of the alternative formulation should be investigated . perhaps in connection with this there is the question of the spectrum of negative energy solutions , to which we have paid scant attention . 
 exploring the @xmath141 limit it might be possible to identify how to embed a relativistic region i within a region ii treated non - relativistically 
 a 5@xmath142 overlayer on a simple metal substrate might be a physical system where such a treatment is appropriate 
 . there could be benefits in terms of computational resources expended if the embedding potential could be determined within the framework of a non - relativistic calculation , and there might also be useful insights in terms of simple models . 
 finally , in terms of implementation for realistic systems , some of the novel schemes for deriving embedding potentials @xcite could certainly be adapted to the relativistic case . 
 it would also be worthwhile to consider whether it is possible to use a restricted electron - like basis , in which the large and small component spinors are combined . 
 this is common practice in most relativistic electronic structure calculations for solids when using basis set techniques ( e.g. @xcite ) , and would result in significant computational efficiencies .","an embedding scheme is developed for the dirac hamiltonian @xmath0 . dividing space into regions i and ii separated by surface @xmath1 , 
 an expression is derived for the expectation value of @xmath0 which makes explicit reference to a trial function defined in i alone , with all details of region ii replaced by an effective potential acting on @xmath1 and which is related to the green function of region ii . 
 stationary solutions provide approximations to the eigenstates of @xmath0 within i. the green function for the embedded hamiltonian is equal to the green function for the entire system in region i. application of the method is illustrated for the problem of a hydrogen atom in a spherical cavity and an au(001)/ag / au(001 ) sandwich structure using basis sets that satisfy kinetic balance .",arxiv
"the analysis of dynamic processes taking place in complex networks is a major research area with a wide range of applications in social , biological , and technological systems @xcite . 
 the spread of information in online social networks , the evolution of an epidemic outbreak in human contact networks , and the dynamics of cascading failures in the electrical grid are relevant examples of these processes . 
 while major advances have been made in this field , most modeling and analysis techniques are specifically tailored to study dynamic processes taking place in static networks . 
 however , empirical observations in social @xcite , biological @xcite , and financial networks @xcite illustrate how real - world networks are constantly evolving over time @xcite . 
 unfortunately , the effects of temporal structural variations in the dynamics of networked systems remain poorly understood .    in the context of temporal networks , we are specially interested in the interplay between the dynamics on networks ( i.e. , the dynamics of processes taking place in the network ) and the dynamics of networks ( i.e. , the temporal evolution of the network structure ) . although the dynamics on and of networks are usually studied separately , there are many cases in which the evolution of the network structure is heavily influenced by the dynamics of processes taking place in the network . 
 one of such cases is found in the context of epidemiology , since healthy individuals tend to avoid contact with infected individuals in order to protect themselves against the disease  a phenomenon called _ social distancing 
 _  @xcite . as a consequence of social distancing 
 , the structure of the network adapts to the dynamics of the epidemics taking place in the network . 
 similar adaptation mechanisms have been studied in the context of power networks  @xcite , biological and neural networks  @xcite and on - line social networks  @xcite .    despite the relevance of network adaptation mechanisms , their effects on the network dynamics are not well understood . in this research direction , we find the seminal work by gross et al .  in @xcite , where a simple adaptive rewiring mechanism was proposed in the context of epidemic models . in this model , a susceptible node can cut edges connecting him to infected neighbors and form new links to _ any _ randomly selected susceptible nodes  without structural constraint in the formation of new links . despite its simplicity 
 , this adaptation mechanism induces a complex bifurcation diagram including healthy , oscillatory , bistable , and endemic epidemic states @xcite . 
 several extensions of this work can be found in the literature  @xcite , where the authors assume homogeneous infection and recovery rates in the network . 
 another model that is specially relevant to our work is the adaptive susceptible - infected - susceptible ( asis ) model proposed in  @xcite . in this model , edges in a given contact network can be temporarily removed in order to prevent the spread of the epidemic . 
 an interesting feature of the asis model is that , in contrast with gross model , it is able to account for arbitrary contact patterns , since links are constrained to be part of a given contact graph . despite its modeling flexibility , 
 analytical results for the asis model  @xcite are based on the assumption of homogeneous contact patterns ( i.e. , the contact graph is complete ) , as well as homogeneous node and edge dynamics ( i.e. , nodes present the same infection and recovery rates , and edges share the same adaptation rates ) .    as a consequence of the lack of tools to analyze network adaptation mechanisms , 
 there is also an absence of effective methodologies for actively utilizing adaptation mechanisms for containing spreading processes . 
 although we find in the literature a few attempts in this direction , most of them rely on extensive numerical simulations  @xcite , on assuming a homogeneous contact patterns @xcite , or a homogeneous node and edge dynamics  @xcite . 
 in contrast , while controlling epidemic processes over static networks , we find a plethora of tools based on game theory  @xcite or convex optimization  @xcite .    in this paper , we study adaptation mechanisms over arbitrary contact networks . 
 in particular , we derive an explicit expression for a lower bound on the epidemic threshold of the asis model for arbitrary networks , as well as heterogeneous node and edge dynamics . in the case of homogeneous node and edge dynamics 
 , we show that the lower bound is proportional to the epidemic threshold of the standard sis model over a static network @xcite . furthermore , based on our results , 
 we propose an efficient algorithm for optimally tuning the adaptation rates of an arbitrary network in order to eradicate an epidemic outbreak in the asis model . 
 we confirm the tightness of the proposed lower bonds with several numerical simulations and compare our optimal adaptation rates with popular centrality measures . 
 in this section , we describe the adaptive susceptible - infected - susceptible ( asis ) model over _ arbitrary _ networks with _ heterogeneous _ node and edge dynamics ( heterogeneous asis model for short ) . 
 we start our exposition by considering a spreading process over a time - varying contact graph  @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the set of nodes and @xmath2 is the time - varying set of edges . for any @xmath3 
 , @xmath4_{i , j}$ ] corresponds to the adjacency matrix of @xmath5 , and the neighborhood of node  @xmath6 at time @xmath7 is defined as @xmath8 . in the standard sis epidemic model , 
 the state of node @xmath6 at time @xmath7 is described by a bernoulli random variable @xmath9 , where node  @xmath6 is said to be _ susceptible _ if @xmath10 , and _ infected _ if @xmath11 . 
 when the contact graph evolves over time , the evolution of @xmath12 is described by a markov process with the following transition probabilities : @xmath13[.8\linewidth ] { p}(x_i(t+h ) = 1 \mid x_i(t ) = 0 ) = \beta_i\ \sum_{\mathclap{k \in { \pazocal{n}}_i(t)}}\ x_k(t)\,h + o(h ) , \end{multlined } \nonumber   \\ & { p}(x_i(t+h ) = 0 \mid x_i(t ) = 1 ) = \delta_i h + o(h ) ,   \label{eq : recovery}\end{aligned}\ ] ] where the parameters @xmath14 and @xmath15 are called the _ infection _ and _ recovery _ rates of node  @xmath6 .    in the heterogeneous asis model , 
 the epidemics takes place over a time - varying network that we model as a continuous - time stochastic graph process  @xmath16 , described below . 
 let @xmath17 be an initial connected contact graph with adjacency matrix  @xmath18_{i , j}$ ] . 
 we assume that @xmath19 is strongly connected . 
 edges in the initial graph @xmath19 appear and disappear over time according to the following markov processes : @xmath13[.9\linewidth ] { p}(a_{ij}(t+h ) = 0 \mid a_{ij}(t ) = 1)=\vspace{.1 cm } \\ 
 \phi_{ij}x_i(t ) h+ \phi_{ji}x_j(t ) h +   o(h ) , \end{multlined}\label{eq : cut } \\ & { p}(a_{ij}(t+h ) = 1 \mid a_{ij}(t ) = 0 ) = a_{ij}(0)\psi_{ij } h +   o(h ) , \label{eq : rewire}\end{aligned}\ ] ] where the parameters @xmath20 and @xmath21 are called the _ cutting _ and _ reconnecting _ rates . 
 notice that the transition rate in depends on @xmath12 and @xmath22 , inducing an adaptation mechanism of the network structure to the state of the epidemics . 
 the transition probability in   can be interpreted as a protection mechanism in which edge @xmath23 is stochastically removed from the network if either node @xmath6 or @xmath24 is infected . more specifically , because of the first summand ( respectively , the second summand ) in , whenever node @xmath6 ( respectively , node @xmath24 ) is infected , edge  @xmath25 is removed from the network according to a poisson process with rate  @xmath26 ( respectively , rate  @xmath27 ) . on the other hand , 
 the transition probability in describes a mechanism for which a ` cut ' edge @xmath25 is ` reconnected ' into the network according to a poisson process with rate @xmath28 ( see figure  [ fig : adaptive ] ) . 
 notice that we include the term @xmath29 in to guarantee that only edges present in the initial contact graph @xmath19 can be added later on by the reconnecting process . 
 in other words , we constrain the set of edges in the adaptive network to be a part of the arbitrary contact graph @xmath19 . 
 in this section , we derive a lower bound on the epidemic threshold for the heterogeneous asis model . for @xmath30 , let @xmath31 denote a poisson counter with rate  @xmath32 @xcite . in what follows , we assume all poisson counters to be stochastically independent . 
 then , from the two equations in , the evolution of the nodal states can be described by the following set of stochastic differential equations @xmath33 for all  @xmath34 . 
 similarly , from and , the evolution of the edges can be described by the following set of stochastic differential equations : @xmath35 for all @xmath36 .    by 
 , the expectation @xmath37 $ ] obeys the differential equation @xmath38   =   -\delta_i e[x_i ] + \beta_i \ 
 \sum_{\mathclap{k\in{\pazocal{n}}_i(0)}}\   e[(1-x_i)a_{ik}x_k].\ ] ] let @xmath39 $ ] and @xmath40 $ ] . 
 then , it follows that @xmath41 where @xmath42\ ] ] contains positive higher - order terms . in what follows , 
 we derive a set of differential equations to describe the evolution of @xmath43 . from and 
 , we obtain the following equation using it rule for jump processes ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) @xmath44 therefore , @xmath45 for all @xmath46 , where @xmath47\\ & + \beta_i\ \sum_{\mathclap{k\in{\pazocal{n}}_i(0)}}\ e\bigl [ x_i(t)x_k(t)a_{ik}(t ) \\ & + ( 1-a_{ij}(t))a_{ik}(t)x_k(t)\bigr],\end{aligned}\ ] ] which contains positive higher - order terms . 
 the differential equations   and describe the joint evolution of the spreading process and the network structure .    for further analysis , it is convenient to express the differential equations   and using vectors and matrices . for this purpose , 
 let us introduce the following notation . 
 let @xmath48 and @xmath49 be , respectively , the @xmath50 identity matrix and the @xmath51-dimensional column vector of all ones . given two matrices @xmath52 and @xmath53 , their kronecker product  @xcite 
 is denoted by @xmath54 . given a sequence of matrices  @xmath55 , their direct sum , denoted by @xmath56 , is defined as the block diagonal matrix having @xmath55 as its block diagonals @xcite . if @xmath55 have the same number of columns , then the matrix obtained by stacking @xmath55 in vertical ( @xmath57 on top ) is denoted by @xmath58 . 
 based on this notation , we define the vector - variable @xmath59 , which contains the infection probabilities of all the nodes in the graph . 
 similarly , let @xmath60 and define the column vector @xmath61 . 
 define @xmath62 as the unique row - vector satisfying @xmath63 note that the length of the row vector @xmath62 and the column vector @xmath64 equals @xmath65 , where @xmath66 is the number of the edges in the initial graph @xmath19 .    using this notation 
 , we define the following matrices : @xmath67 where @xmath68 denotes the degree of node  @xmath6 in the initial graph  @xmath19 . 
 furthermore , we also define the following matrices @xmath69    stacking the set of @xmath70 differential equations in into a single vector equation , and ignoring the negative higher - order term @xmath71 , we obtain the following entry - wise vector inequality for the probabilities of infection : @xmath72 also , stacking the set of differential equations in with respect to @xmath73 , and ignoring the negative term  @xmath74 , we obtain the following entry - wise vector inequality : @xmath75 where @xmath76 . we can further stack the above inequalities with respect to the index @xmath6 to obtain the following entry - wise vector inequality : @xmath77 combining this inequality and , we obtain @xmath78/dt } \frac{d}{dt}\begin{bmatrix } p 
 q \end{bmatrix }   \leq m   \begin{bmatrix } p 
 \\ q \end{bmatrix},\ ] ] where @xmath79 is an irreducible matrix ( see appendix  [ appx : pf : irreducibility ] for the proof of irreducibility ) defined as @xmath80 therefore , the evolution of the joint vector variable  @xmath81 is upper - bounded by the linear dynamics given by the matrix @xmath79 . moreover , 
 the upper bound is tight around the origin , since both @xmath82 and @xmath83 consist of higher - order terms . from 
 , we conclude that the epidemics dies out exponentially fast in the heterogeneous asis model if @xmath84 where @xmath85 is defined as the maximum among the real parts of the eigenvalues of @xmath79 . furthermore 
 , since @xmath79 is a metzler matrix ( i.e. , has nonnegative off - diagonals ) and irreducible , there is a real eigenvalue of @xmath79 equal to  @xmath85 @xcite . 
 in the homogeneous case , where all the nodes share the same infection rate @xmath86 and recovery rate  @xmath87 , and all the edges share the same cutting rate  @xmath88 and reconnecting rate  @xmath89 , the condition   reduces to the following inequality : @xmath90 where @xmath91 is the spectral radius of the initial graph @xmath19 and @xmath92 which we call the _ effective cutting rate_. the proof of the extinction condition is given in appendix  [ appx : pf : thm : stbl : homo ] . 
 we remark that , in the special case when the network does not adapt to the prevalence of infection , i.e. , when @xmath93 , we have that @xmath94 and , therefore , the condition in   is identical to the extinction condition  @xmath95 corresponding to the homogeneous networked sis model over a static network  @xcite . 
 it is worth comparing the condition in with the epidemic threshold @xmath96 given in @xcite for the case in which @xmath19 is the complete graph : @xmath97 where @xmath98 is the link - creating rate , @xmath99 is the link - breaking rate , and @xmath100 is a positive and `` slowly varying '' function depending on the metastable long - time average of the number of infected nodes ( for details , see @xcite ) . 
 we first notice that our lower bound in can be checked directly from the parameters of the model , namely , the adjacency matrix of the initial graph @xmath19 and the relevant rates of the model . 
 this is in contrast with the threshold in  , since it depends on the metastable average of the number of infected nodes and , thus , can only be computed via numerical simulations . 
 we also remark that the lower bound on the epidemic threshold in and the epidemic threshold in both exhibit affine dependence on the effective link - breaking rates  @xmath101 and  @xmath102 , respectively . 
 finally , we see that the recovery rate @xmath103 appears in different places in the two conditions , namely , inside the expression of @xmath101 in and inside the function  @xmath100 in . 
 however , the consequences of this difference are not obvious , since @xmath100 is defined via the metastable state and , therefore , does not allow an analytical investigation .    [ cols=""^,^,^,^ "" , ]     once the cost functions are selected , we must solve the problem of finding the optimal tuning investment to achieve a desired exponential decay rate in the probabilities of infection . from the inequality in , 
 the infection probabilities @xmath104 , @xmath105 , @xmath106 decay exponentially at a rate ( at least ) @xmath107 if @xmath108 since @xmath79 is an irreducible and metzler matrix , we can use perron - frobenius theory  @xcite to prove that is satisfied if there exists an entry - wise positive vector  @xmath109 satisfying the following entry - wise vector inequality ( see @xcite for more details ) : @xmath110 therefore , problem  [ prb : ] can be reduced to the following equivalent optimization problem : @xmath111 as we show in appendix  [ appx : gp ] , we can equivalently transform this optimization problem into a geometric program  @xcite , which can be efficiently solved using standard optimization software . 
 the computational complexity of solving the resulting geometric program is @xmath112 , where @xmath70 is the number of nodes and @xmath66 is the number of edges in the initial network @xmath19 .    in the rest of this section , 
 we compute the optimal tuning profiles for three different graphs and compare our results with several network centralities . in our simulations , we consider the following three graphs with @xmath113 nodes : _ 1 _ ) an erds - rnyi graph with @xmath114 edges , _ 2 _ ) a barabsi - albert random graph with @xmath115 edges , and _ 3 _ ) a social subgraph ( obtained from facebook ) with @xmath116 edges . for simplicity in our simulations , we assume that all nodes share the same recovery rate  @xmath117 and infection rate @xmath118 , where @xmath91 denotes the spectral radius of each initial graph . since @xmath119 , the extinction condition indicates that the infection process does not necessarily die out without adaptation , i.e. , when @xmath120 . 
 the rest of parameters in our simulations are set as follows : we let @xmath121 , @xmath122 , and @xmath123 . also , the parameters in the cost functions are @xmath124 and @xmath125 . 
 the desired exponential decay rate is chosen to be @xmath126 .    using this set of parameters , we solve the optimization problem   following the procedure described in appendix  [ appx : gp ] . 
 our numerical results are illustrated in various figures included in table  [ table : ] . 
 each figure is a scatter plot where each point corresponds to a particular edge @xmath46 ; the ordinate of each point corresponding to its optimal cutting rate @xmath26 , and the abscissa of each point corresponds to a particular edge - centrality measure . in these figures , we use three different edge - centrality measures : a ) the product of the degrees of nodes @xmath6 and @xmath24 ( left column ) , b ) the product of the eigenvector - centralities of nodes @xmath6 and @xmath24 ( center column ) , and c ) the betweenness centralities of edge @xmath25 ( right column ) .    in our numerical results , 
 we observe how both degree - based and eigenvector - based edge - centralities are good measures for determining the amount of investment in tuning cutting rates . 
 in contrast , betweenness centrality does not show a significant dependency on the optimal cutting rates . 
 in particular , for the synthetic networks in rows 1 ) and 2 ) in table [ table : ] , we observe an almost piecewise affine relationship with the centrality measures in columns a ) and b ) . in particular , in these subplots 
 we observe how edges of low centrality require no investment , while for higher - centrality edges , the tuning investment tends to increase affinely as the centrality of the edge increases  as expected . 
 for the real social network in row c ) , the relationship between investment and centralities is still strong  although not as clear as in synthetic networks . in the scatter plot corresponding to the relationship between the optimal investment and the eigenvector - based centrality in the real social network ( lower center figure in table [ table : ] ) , we observe a collection of several stratified parallel lines . 
 we conjecture that each line corresponds to a different community inside the social network ; in other words , the relationship between centrality and optimal investment is almost affine inside each community . 
 we have studied an _ adaptive _ susceptible - infected - susceptible ( asis ) model with heterogeneous node and edge dynamics and arbitrary network topologies . 
 we have derived an explicit expression for a lower bound on the epidemic threshold of this model in terms of the maximum real eigenvalue of a matrix that depends explicitly on the network topology and the parameters of the model . for networks with homogeneous node and edge dynamics , the lower 
 bound turns out to be a constant multiple of the epidemic threshold in the standard sis model over static networks ( in particular , the inverse of the spectral radius ) . 
 furthermore , based on our results , we have proposed an optimization framework to find the cost - optimal adaptation rates in order to eradicate the epidemics . 
 we have confirmed the accuracy of our theoretical results with several numerical simulations and compare cost - optimal adaptation rates with popular centrality measures in various networks .

 we show that the matrix @xmath79 defined in is irreducible , that is , there is no similarity transformation that transforms @xmath79 into a block upper - triangular matrix . for this purpose , 
 define @xmath127 where @xmath128 , @xmath129 , and @xmath130 . since the rates @xmath131 and @xmath28 are positive , if @xmath132 , then @xmath133 for all distinct @xmath6 and @xmath24 . 
 therefore , to prove the irreducibility of @xmath79 , it is sufficient to show that @xmath134 is irreducible .    in order to show that @xmath134 is irreducible , we shall show that the directed graph @xmath135 on the nodes @xmath136 , defined as the graph having adjacency matrix  @xmath137 , is strongly connected . 
 we identify the nodes @xmath138 , @xmath105 , @xmath139 and variables @xmath104 , @xmath105 , @xmath106 , @xmath140 ( @xmath141 ) , @xmath105 , @xmath142 ( @xmath143 ) . 
 then , the upper - right block  @xmath144 of the matrix @xmath134 indicates that the graph @xmath135 contains the directed edge  @xmath145 for all @xmath146 and @xmath147 . 
 similarly , from the matrices @xmath148 and  @xmath149 in @xmath79 , we see that @xmath135 contains the directed edges  @xmath150 and @xmath151 for all @xmath146 and @xmath152 .    using these observations , let us first show that @xmath135 has a directed path from @xmath153 to @xmath154 for all @xmath155 . since @xmath19 is strongly connected , it has a path @xmath156 such that @xmath157 and @xmath158 . 
 therefore , from the above observations , we see that @xmath135 contains the directed path @xmath159 . in the same way 
 , we can show that @xmath135 also contains the directed path @xmath160 for every @xmath161 . 
 these two types of directed paths in @xmath135 guarantees that @xmath135 is strongly connected . hence the matrix  @xmath134 is irreducible , as desired . 
 in the homogeneous case , the matrix @xmath79 takes the form @xmath162 in what follows , we show that @xmath163 if and only if holds true . 
 since @xmath19 is strongly connected by assumption , its adjacency matrix  @xmath164 is irreducible and therefore has an entry - wise positive eigenvector  @xmath109 corresponding to the eigenvalue  @xmath91 ( see  @xcite ) . define the positive vector @xmath165 . 
 then , the definition of  @xmath62 in shows @xmath166 and therefore @xmath167 . in the same manner , we can show that @xmath168 . 
 moreover , it is straightforward to check that @xmath169 
 . therefore , for a real number @xmath170 , it follows that @xmath171 hence , if a real number @xmath172 satisfies the following equations : @xmath173 then @xmath174 is an eigenvector of @xmath79 . since @xmath79 is irreducible ( shown in appendix  [ appx : pf : irreducibility ] ) , by perron - frobenius theory  @xcite , if @xmath175 then @xmath176 ( see ( * ? ? ? * theorem  17 ) ) . 
 this , in particular , shows that @xmath163 if and only if there exist @xmath175 and @xmath177 such that holds .    the two equations in have two pairs of solutions @xmath178 and @xmath179 such that @xmath180 , and @xmath181 . 
 therefore , we need to show @xmath182 if and only if holds true . to see this 
 , we notice that @xmath183 and @xmath184 are the solutions of the quadratic equation @xmath185 following from . since @xmath186 
 , we have @xmath187 if and only if the constant term @xmath188 of the quadratic equation is positive , which is indeed equivalent to . 
 this completes the proof of the extinction condition stated in  . 
 we first give a brief review of geometric programs  @xcite . 
 let @xmath189 , @xmath105 , @xmath190 denote positive variables and define @xmath191 . 
 we say that a real function  @xmath192 is a _ monomial _ if there exist @xmath193 and @xmath194 such that @xmath195 . 
 also , we say that a function  @xmath196 is a _ posynomial _ if it is a sum of monomials of  @xmath197 ( we point the readers to  @xcite for more details ) . given a collection of posynomials @xmath198 , @xmath105 , @xmath199 and monomials @xmath200 
 , @xmath105 , @xmath201 , the optimization problem @xmath202 is called a _ geometric program_. a constraint of the form @xmath203 with @xmath196 being a posynomial is called a posynomial constraint . 
 although geometric programs are not convex , they can be efficiently converted into equivalent convex optimization problems  @xcite .    in the following , we rewrite the optimization problem   into a geometric program using the new variables @xmath204 and @xmath205 . 
 by , these variables should satisfy the constraints @xmath206 also , using these variables , the cost function @xmath207 can be written as @xmath208 , where @xmath209 are posynomials . in order to rewrite the constraint  , 
 we first define the matrices @xmath210 we also introduce the positive constants @xmath211 , @xmath212 , @xmath213 . now , 
 adding @xmath214 to both sides of , we equivalently obtain @xmath215 where @xmath216 is given by      summarizing , we have shown that the optimization problem   is equivalent to the following optimization problem with ( entry - wise ) positive variables : @xmath218 in this optimization problem , the objective function is a posynomial in the variables @xmath219 , @xmath220 , and @xmath221 . 
 also , the box constraints , , and can be written as posynomial constraints  @xcite . 
 finally , since each entry of the matrix @xmath222 is a posynomial in the variables @xmath219 , @xmath220 , and  @xmath221 , the vector - constraint yields @xmath139 posynomial constraints . 
 therefore , the optimization problem is a geometric program , as desired . 
 furthremore , a standard estimate on the computational complexity of solving geometric program ( see , e.g. , ( * ? ? ? 
 * proposition  3 ) ) shows that the computational complexity of solving the optimization problem in is given by @xmath112 . 
 finally we remark that @xmath222 contains both the terms  @xmath28 and @xmath223 so that we can not use @xmath28 as the decision variable in the geometric program   due to the positivity constraint on decision variables . by this reason , we can not design the reconnecting rates @xmath28 under the framework presented in this paper . 
 this issue is left as an open problem .","in this paper , we study the dynamics of epidemic processes taking place in adaptive networks of arbitrary topology . 
 we focus our study on the adaptive susceptible - infected - susceptible ( asis ) model , where healthy individuals are allowed to temporarily cut edges connecting them to infected nodes in order to prevent the spread of the infection . in this paper 
 , we derive a closed - form expression for a lower bound on the epidemic threshold of the asis model in arbitrary networks with heterogeneous node and edge dynamics . for networks with homogeneous node and edge dynamics , we show that the resulting lower bound is proportional to the epidemic threshold of the standard sis model over static networks , with a proportionality constant that depends on the adaptation rates . 
 furthermore , based on our results , we propose an efficient algorithm to optimally tune the adaptation rates in order to eradicate epidemic outbreaks in arbitrary networks . 
 we confirm the tightness of the proposed lower bounds with several numerical simulations and compare our optimal adaptation rates with popular centrality measures .",arxiv
"cosmological observations coming from type ia supernovae @xcite , cosmic microwave background radiation @xcite and the large scale structure @xcite , provide evidences that the universe is currently in an accelerating phase . 
 this result is , in general , ascribed to the existence of a sort of dark energy ( de ) sector in the universe , an exotic energy source characterized by a negative pressure . at late times 
 , the dark - energy sector eventually dominates over the cold dark matter ( cdm ) , and drives the universe to the observed accelerating expansion . 
 the simplest candidate for de is the cosmological constant @xmath2 , which has an equation - of - state parameter @xmath3 . 
 although this model is in agreement with current observations , it is plagued by some difficulties related to the small observational value of de density with respect to the expected one arising from quantum field theories ( the well known cosmological constant problem @xcite ) . 
 moreover , the @xmath2cdm paradigm , where cold dark matter ( cdm ) is considered into the game , may also suffer from the age problem , as it was shown in @xcite , while the present data seem to slightly favor an evolving de with the equation - of - state parameter crossing @xmath3 from above to below in the near cosmological past @xcite .    over the past decade 
 several de models have been proposed , such as quintessence @xcite , phantom @xcite , k - essence @xcite , tachyon @xcite , quintom @xcite , chaplygin gas @xcite , generalized chaplygin gas ( gcg ) @xcite , holographic de @xcite , new agegraphic de @xcite , ricci de @xcite etc . on the other hand , there are also numerous models that induce an effective dark energy which arises from modifications of the gravitational sector itself , such as @xmath4 gravity @xcite ( this class is very efficient in verifying observational and theoretical constraints and explain the universe acceleration and phantom crossing @xcite ) , or gravity with higher curvature invariants @xcite , by coupling the ricci scalar to a scalar field @xcite , by introducing a vector field contribution @xcite , or by using properties of gravity in higher dimensional spacetimes @xcite ( for a review see @xcite ) .    a possibility that can be explored to explain the accelerated phase of the universe is to consider a theory of gravity based on the weitzenbck connection , instead of the levi - civita one , which deduces that the gravitational field is described by the torsion instead of the curvature tensor . in such theories , 
 the torsion tensor is achieved from products of first derivatives of tetrad fields , and hence no second derivatives appear . 
 this _ teleparallel _ 
 approach @xcite , is closely related to general relativity , except for `` boundary terms '' @xcite that involve total derivatives in the action , and thus one can construct the teleparallel equivalent of general relativity ( tegr ) , which is completely equivalent with general relativity at the level of equations but is based on torsion instead of curvature . 
 teleparallel gravity possesses a number of attractive features related to geometrical and physical aspects @xcite . 
 hence , one can start from tegr and construct various gravitational modifications based on torsion , with @xmath1 gravity being the most studied one @xcite . 
 in particular , it may represent an alternative to inflationary models without the use of the inflaton , as well as to effective de models , in which the universe acceleration is driven by the extra torsion terms @xcite ( for a detailed review , see @xcite ) . 
 the main advantage of @xmath1 gravity is that the field equations are 2nd - order ones , a property that makes these theories simpler if compared to the dynamical equations of other extended theories of gravity , such as @xmath4 gravity . 
 the aim of this paper is to explore the implications of @xmath1 gravity to the formation of light elements in the early universe , i.e. to the big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) . on the other hand , we want to explore the possibility to constrain @xmath1 gravity by bbn observatio nal data . 
 bbn has occurred between the first fractions of second after the big bang , around @xmath5 sec , and a few hundreds of seconds after it , when the universe was hot and dense ( indeed bbn , together with cosmic microwave background radiation , provides the strong evidence about the high temperatures characterizing the primordial universe ) . 
 it describes the sequence of nuclear reactions that yielded the synthesis of light elements @xcite , and therefore drove the observed universe . in general , from bbn physics , one may infer stringent constraints on a given cosmological model . 
 hence , in this work , we shall confront various @xmath1 gravity models with bbn calculations based on current observational data on primordial abundance of @xmath0 , and we shall extract constraints on their free parameters . 
 the layout of the paper is as follows . in section [ revmodel ] 
 we review @xmath1 gravity and the related cosmological models . in section [ bbnanal ] 
 we use bbn calculations in order to impose constraints on the free parameters of specific @xmath1 gravity models . 
 conclusions are reported in section [ conclusions ] . 
 finally , in the appendix we summarize the main notions of bbn physics . 
 let us briefly review @xmath1 gravity , and apply it in a cosmological framework . in this formulation , 
 the dynamical variable is the vierbein field @xmath6 , @xmath7 , which forms an orthonormal basis in the tangent space at each point @xmath8 of the manifold , i.e. @xmath9 , with @xmath10 the minkowsky metric with signature @xmath11 : @xmath12 . denoting with @xmath13 , 
 @xmath14 the components of the vectors @xmath15 in a coordinate basis @xmath16 , one can write @xmath17 . as a convection , here we use the latin indices for the tangent space , and the greek indices for the coordinates on the manifold . the dual vierbein allows to obtain the metric tensor of the manifold , namely @xmath18 .    in teleparallel gravity 
 , one adopts the curvatureless weitzenbck connection ( contrarily to general relativity which is based on the torsion - less levi - civita connection ) , which gives rise to the non - null torsion tensor : @xmath19 remarkably , the torsion tensor ( [ torsion ] ) encompasses all the information about the gravitational field . 
 the lagrangian density is built using its contractions , and hence the teleparallel action is given by @xmath20 with @xmath21 , and where the torsion scalar @xmath22 reads as @xmath23 here , it is @xmath24 with @xmath25 the contorsion tensor which gives the difference between weitzenbck and levi - civita connections . finally , the variation of action ( [ action0 ] ) in terms of the vierbiens gives rise to the field equations , which coincide with those of general relativity . 
 that is why the above theory is called the teleparallel equivalent of general relativity ( tegr ) . 
 one can now start from tegr , and generalize action ( [ action0 ] ) in order to construct gravitational modifications based on torsion . 
 the simplest scenario is to consider a lagrangian density that is a function of @xmath22 , namely @xmath26},\ ] ] that reduces to tegr as soon as @xmath27 . 
 considering additionally a matter lagrangian @xmath28 , variation with respect to the vierbein gives the field equations @xcite @xmath29-     e_i^\lambda { t^\rho}_{\mu\lambda}{s_\rho}^{\nu\mu}[1+f']\nonumber\\     & &    + e^\rho_i { s_\rho}^{\,\,\mu\nu}(\partial_\mu t)f '' +      \frac{1}{4}e^\nu_i [ t+f]=4\pi g\,{e_i}^\rho\ , { \theta_\rho}^\nu\,,\end{aligned}\ ] ] where @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 is the energy - momentum tensor for the matter sector .    in order to explore the cosmological implications of @xmath1 gravity , we focus on homogeneous and isotropic geometry , considering the usual choice for the vierbiens , namely @xmath33 which corresponds to a flat friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) background metric of the form @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the scale factor . equations ( [ torsion ] ) , ( [ lagrangian ] ) , ( [ s ] ) and ( [ contorsion ] ) allow to derive a relation between the torsion @xmath22 and the hubble parameter @xmath36 , namely @xmath37 hence , in the case of frw geometry , and assuming that the matter sector corresponds to a perfect fluid with energy density @xmath38 and pressure @xmath39 , the @xmath40 component of ( [ equations ] ) yields @xmath41+[t+f]=16\pi g\rho,\ ] ] while the @xmath42 component gives @xmath43-(t - f)=16\pi gp.\ ] ] the equations close by considering the equation of continuity for the matter sector , namely @xmath44 . 
 one can rewrite ( [ friedmann ] ) and ( [ acceleration ] ) in the usual form @xmath45 @xmath46 where @xmath47,\\      p_t&=&\frac{1}{16\pi g}\ , \frac{f - t f'+ 2t^2f''}{1+f'+ 2{t}f '' } \ , , \label{pt}\end{aligned}\ ] ] are the effective energy density and pressure arising from torsional contributions . 
 one can therefore define the effective torsional equation - of - state parameter as @xmath48 in these classes of theories , the above effective torsional terms are responsible for the accelerated phases of the early or / and late universe @xcite . 
 let us present now three specific @xmath1 forms , which are the viable ones amongst the variety of @xmath1 models with two parameters out of which one is independent , i.e which pass the basic observational tests @xcite .    1 . 
 the power - law model by bengochea and ferraro ( hereafter @xmath49cdm ) @xcite is characterized by the form @xmath50 where @xmath51 and @xmath52 are the two model parameters . inserting this @xmath1 form into friedmann equation ( [ friedmann ] ) at present , we acquire @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the matter density parameter at present , and @xmath55 is the current hubble parameter value . 
 the best fit on the parameter @xmath52 is obtained taking the @xmath56 observational data , and it reads @xcite @xmath57 clearly , for @xmath58 the present scenario reduces to @xmath2cdm cosmology , namely @xmath59 , with @xmath60 . 
 2 .   the linder model ( hereafter @xmath61cdm ) @xcite arises from @xmath62 with @xmath63 and @xmath39 ( @xmath64 ) the two model parameters . in this case 
 ( [ friedmann ] ) gives that @xmath65 the @xmath56 observational data imply that the best fit of @xmath64 is @xcite @xmath66 as we can see , for @xmath67 the present scenario reduces to @xmath2cdm cosmology . 
 3 .   motivated by exponential @xmath4 gravity @xcite , bamba et . al . introduced the following @xmath1 model ( hereafter @xmath68cdm ) @xcite : @xmath69 with @xmath63 and @xmath39 ( @xmath64 ) the two model parameters . in this case 
 we acquire @xmath70 for this model , and using @xmath56 observational data , the best fit is found to be @xcite @xmath71 similarly to the previous case we can immediately see that @xmath68cdm model tends to @xmath2cdm cosmology for @xmath67 .    the above @xmath1 models are considered viable in literature because pass the basic observational tests @xcite . 
 they are characterized by two free parameters . 
 actually there are two more models with two free parameters , namely the logarithmic model @xcite , @xmath72 and the hyperbolic - tangent model @xcite , @xmath73 nevertheless since these two models do not possess @xmath2cdm cosmology as a limiting case and since they are in tension with observational data @xcite , in this work we do not consider them .    finally , let us note that one could also construct @xmath1 models with more than two parameters , for example , combining the above scenarios . 
 however , considering many free parameters would be a significant disadvantage concerning the corresponding values of the information criteria . 
 in the section , we examine the bbn in the framework of @xmath1 cosmology . as it is well known , 
 bbn occurs during the radiation dominated era . 
 the energy density of relativistic particles filling up the universe is given by @xmath74 , where @xmath75 is the effective number of degrees of freedom and @xmath76 the temperature ( in the appendix we review the main features related to the bbn physics ) . 
 the neutron abundance is computed via the conversion rate of protons into neutrons , namely @xmath77 and its inverse @xmath78 . 
 the relevant quantity is the total rate given by @xmath79 explicit calculations of eq .

 the primordial mass fraction of @xmath84 can be estimated by making use of the relation @xcite @xmath85 here @xmath86 , with @xmath87 the time of the freeze - out of the weak interactions , @xmath88 the time of the freeze - out of the nucleosynthesis , @xmath89 the neutron mean lifetime given in ( [ rateproc3 ] ) , and @xmath90 is the neutron - to - proton equilibrium ratio . the function @xmath91 is interpreted as the fraction of neutrons that decay into protons during the interval @xmath92 $ ] . 
 deviations from the fractional mass @xmath93 due to the variation of the freezing temperature @xmath94 are given by @xmath95      \frac{\delta { \cal t}_f}{{\cal t}_f}\,,\ ] ] where we have set @xmath96 since @xmath97 is fixed by the deuterium binding energy @xcite . 
 the experimental estimations of the mass fraction @xmath93 of baryon converted to @xmath98 during the big bang nucleosynthesis are @xcite @xmath99 inserting these into ( [ deltayp ] ) one infers the upper bound on @xmath100 , namely @xmath101    during the bbn , at the radiation dominated era , the scale factor evolves as @xmath102 , where @xmath103 is cosmic time . the torsional energy density @xmath104 is treated as a perturbation to the radiation energy density @xmath38 . 
 the relation between the cosmic time and the temperature is given by @xmath105 ( or @xmath106mev ) . 
 furthermore , we use the entropy conservation @xmath107 . 
 the expansion rate of the universe is derived from ( [ modfri ] ) , and can be rewritten in the form @xmath108 where @xmath109 ( @xmath110 is the expansion rate of the universe in general relativity ) . 
 thus , from the relation @xmath111 , one derives the freeze - out temperature @xmath112 , with @xmath113 mev ( which follows from @xmath114 ) and @xmath115 from which , in the regime @xmath116 , one obtains : @xmath117 with @xmath118gev@xmath83 .    in what follows 
 we shall investigate the bounds that arise from the bbn constraints , on the free parameters of the three @xmath1 models presented in the previous section . 
 these constraint will be determined using eqs . 
 ( [ deltat / tboundg ] ) and ( [ rhot ] ) . 
 moreover , we shall use the numerical values @xmath119 where @xmath120 is the present value of cmb temperature .

 we acquire @xmath134e^{-p({\cal t}_f/{\cal t}_0)^{4 m } }      \ ! -\!\frac{1}{2}\right\}.\end{aligned}\ ] ] hence , using this relation we can calculate the value of @xmath135 for various values of @xmath136 that span the order of magnitude of the best fit values ( [ bestfit1 ] ) and ( [ bestfit2 ] ) that were obtained using @xmath56 observational data in @xcite , and we present our results in table [ tab1 ] . 
 as we can see , in all cases the value of @xmath135 is well below the bbn bound ( [ deltat / tbound ] ) . 
 hence , bbn can not impose constraints on the parameter values of @xmath128cdm and @xmath129cdm models . 
 .@xmath135 from ( [ delta12insieme ] ) for different values of @xmath136 , for @xmath137 ( @xmath128cdm model ) and @xmath138 ( @xmath129cdm model ) .

 in this work we have investigated the implications of @xmath1 gravity to the formation of light elements in the early universe , i.e. to the bbn . in particular , we have examined the three most used and well studied viable @xmath1 models , namely the power law , the exponential and the square - root exponential , and we have confronted them with bbn calculations based on current observational data on primordial abundance of @xmath0 . 
 hence , we were able to extract constraints on their free parameters . 
 concerning the power - law @xmath1 model , the obtained constraint on the exponent @xmath52 , is @xmath125 . 
 remarkably , this bound is in agreement with the constraints obtained using @xmath56 observational data @xcite . 
 concerning the exponential and the square - root exponential , we showed that , for realistic regions of free parameters , they always satisfy the bbn bounds . 
 this means that , in these cases , bbn can not impose strict constraints on the values of free parameters .    in summary 
 , we showed that viable @xmath1 models , namely those that pass the basic observational tests , can also satisfy the bbn constraints . 
 this feature acts as an additional advantage of @xmath1 gravity , which might be a successful candidate for describing the gravitational interaction . 
 as discussed in @xcite , this kind of constraints could contribute in the debate of fixing the most realistic picture that can be based on curvature or torsion . 
 this article is based upon work from cost action ca15117 `` cosmology and astrophysics network for theoretical advances and training actions '' ( cantata ) , supported by cost ( european cooperation in science and technology ) . 
 in this appendix we briefly review the main features of big bang nucleosynthesis following @xcite . in the early universe , 
 the primordial @xmath0 was formed at temperature @xmath139 mev . 
 the energy and number density were formed by relativistic leptons ( electron , positron and neutrinos ) and photons . 
 the rapid collisions maintain all these particles in thermal equilibrium . 
 interactions of protons and neutrons were kept in thermal equilibrium by means of their interactions with leptons @xmath140    the neutron abundance is estimated by computing the conversion rate of protons into neutrons , i.e. @xmath141 , and its inverse @xmath78 . 
 thus , the weak interaction rates ( at suitably high temperature ) are given by @xmath142 the rate @xmath143 is the sum of the rates associated to the processes ( [ proc1])-([proc3 ] ) , namely @xmath144 finally , the rate @xmath143 is related to the rate @xmath145 as @xmath146 , with @xmath147 the mass difference of neutron and proton .    during the freeze - out stage 
 , one can use the following approximations @xcite : ( i ) the temperatures of particles are the same , i.e. @xmath148 . 
 ( ii ) the temperature @xmath76 is lower than the typical energies @xmath149 that contribute to the integrals entering the definition of the rates ( one can therefore replace the fermi - dirac distribution with the boltzmann one , namely @xmath150 ) . 
 ( iii ) the electron mass @xmath151 can be neglected with respect to the electron and neutrino energies ( @xmath152 ) . 
 having these in mind , the interaction rate corresponding to the process ( [ proc1 ] ) is given by @xmath153 where @xmath154\ , , \label{wa}\\     { \cal p }   &    \equiv &   p_n+p_{\nu_e}-p_p - p_e\ , ,   \\   { \cal m } & = & \left(\frac{g_w}{8m_w}\right)^2 [ { \bar u}_p\omega^\mu u_n][{\bar u}_e\sigma_\mu v_{\nu_e}]\ , , \label{m } \\ 
 \omega^\mu & \equiv & \gamma^\mu(c_v - c_a \gamma^5)\ , ,    \\ 
 \sigma^\mu &    \equiv & \gamma^\mu(1-\gamma^5 ) \ , . 
 \end{aligned}\ ] ] in ( [ m ] ) we have used the condition @xmath155 , where @xmath156 is the mass of the vector gauge boson @xmath157 , with @xmath158 the transferred momentum . from eq . 
 ( [ rateproc1 ] ) it follows that @xmath159 where @xmath160 and where @xmath161d\epsilon,\ ] ] with @xmath162      lastly , for the neutron decay ( [ proc3 ] ) one obtains @xmath166 hence , in the calculation of ( [ sumprocess ] ) we can safely neglect the above interaction rate of the neutron decay , i.e. during the bbn the neutron can be considered as a stable particle . 
 the above approximations ( i)-(iii ) lead to @xcite @xmath167 thus , inserting ( [ auxilirel ] ) into ( [ sumprocess ] ) , and then into ( [ lambdaa ] ) , allows to derive the expression for @xmath168 , namely @xmath169 which using ( [ ne - pnu - fin ] ) leads to @xmath170    99 a. g. riess , et al . , astron .

"in the last few years there has been another wave of excitement regarding the question of neutrino masses . 
 this is largely due to the many new experiments testing neutrino oscillations , most notably the positive indications obtained by super kamiokande on atmospheric neutrino oscillations @xcite . 
 similar indications come from other experiments @xcite . 
 the solar neutrino experiments have for many years provided independent evidence for neutrino oscillations @xcite . 
 accelerator and reactor experiments have also played an important role . they have furnished strict bounds on neutrino oscillation parameters @xcite . in the case of the lsnd experiment @xcite at los alamos evidence for @xmath2 oscillation has been reported . 
 see refs @xcite for recent reviews . 
 it is hoped that new experimental results can be used to determine the neutrino squared mass differences and mixing angles . in turn , these may help to infer the neutrino mass matrix . 
 this is presumably a possible gateway to a more fundamental theory beyond the standard model . 
 of course this is a highly speculative area , and even though there are many imaginative proposals @xcite , it seems fair to say that the the true answer is essentially unknown . in order to make progress in this direction 
 , it seems useful to investigate various plausible ansatze for the neutrino mass matrix . from this point of view 
 we propose the ansatz for the 3 generation neutrino mass matrix , @xmath3 : @xmath4 and investigate its consequences . 
 we are considering the neutrinos to be represented by 2-component spinors so that , in the most general situation , @xmath3 is an arbitrary symmetric complex matrix .    as we will see in section ii , eq . ( 1.1 ) can be motivated from an so(10 ) grand unified model @xcite , in which it may be derived with some assumptions . physically , eq . 
 ( 1.1 ) corresponds to the well known approximate signature of grand unification that @xmath5 . 
 furthermore we will see in sections iv and v that eq . 
 ( 1.1 ) can be straightforwardly combined with experimental information to get an idea of the neutrino masses themselves as well as the `` texture '' of @xmath6 . 
 relevant matters of notation are discussed in section iii while a summary is presented in section vi . 
 in the so(10 ) grand unification model each generation contains one light massive two component neutrino and also a very heavy one which is `` integrated out '' according to the `` seesaw mechanism '' @xcite . 
 the effective @xmath7 neutrino mass matrix takes the form : @xmath8 where @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 are respectively the mass matrices of the light neutrinos , heavy neutrinos and heavy - light mixing ( or `` dirac matrix '' ) . generally the second , seesaw , term 
 is considered to dominate . here 
 however we shall assume the first term to be the dominant one . 
 this is necessary for the present derivation of eq . 
 ( 1.1 ) to hold . 
 also , a rough order of magnitude estimate for the second term would be @xmath12 or about @xmath13 ev . thus , the seesaw term could be negligible if neutrino masses turn out to be appreciably larger than this value . 
 now in so(10 ) , higgs mesons belonging to the 10 , 120 and 126 representations can contribute to the fermion masses at tree level . 
 one has @xcite for the down quark , charged lepton and light neutrino mass matrices , @xmath14 where @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 are numbers representing higgs meson vacuum values . 
 s(10 ) , a(120 ) and s(126 ) are the matrices of the yukawa type constants which couple the fermions to the 10 , 120 and 126 higgs mesons respectively ; the matrices s(10 ) and s(126 ) must be symmetric while a(120 ) is antisymmetric . 
 finally , @xmath20 is a renormalization factor for comparing the quark masses with the charged lepton masses at a low energy scale rather than at the grand unified scale ; @xmath21 is a similar factor for the neutrino masses . with the stated assumption that the @xmath22 term dominates in eq . 
 ( 2.1 ) we get @xmath23 which clearly also holds when any number of 10 s or 120 s are present but only a single 126 . 
 the matrices appearing in eq . 
 ( 2.3 ) are so far essentially unrestricted complex ones . 
 to proceed , we make the further assumption that the matrices are hermitian . 
 then @xmath24 and @xmath25 may each be brought to diagonal form by unitary transformations . 
 thus the right hand side of eq . 
 ( 2.3 ) may be evaluated to yield approximately , @xmath26 according to a well known numerical success , based on the observation that @xmath27 , of grand unification @xcite . note that we have not needed to assume that the mass matrix has any zero elements . 
 where , in addition , a special combined fritzsch - stech ansatz was used . 
 here we are not making any special ansatz of this type for the mass matrices . ] even if the cancellation on the right hand side of eq . 
 ( 2.4 ) is not perfect , it should still be a good approximation . 
 in an so(10 ) model where the mass matrices are hermitian , @xmath28 will be real symmetric . 
 we will investigate this case and also the possibility that the more general case holds . 
 our plan is to combine the ansatz eq . ( 1.1 ) with experimentally obtained results on neutrino oscillations in order to learn more about @xmath29 itself . for this purpose 
 it may be helpful to set down our notation @xcite for the pieces of the effective @xmath30 theory involving neutrinos and to make some related remarks . 
 the free lagrangian containing three two component massive fields is : @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the ( not yet diagonalized ) neutrino mass matrix of the underlying theory to be identified with the matrix in eq . 
 note that we are free to multiply the first mass term in eq . 
 ( [ lfree ] ) by an overall arbitrary phase which is a matter of convention . 
 it is possible@xcite to find a unitary matrix @xmath33 which brings @xmath0 to real , positive , diagonal form in the following way : @xmath34 the mass diagonal fields @xmath35 are then @xmath36 similarly , the column vector of left handed negatively charged leptons in the underlying theory , @xmath37 is related to the mass diagonal fields @xmath38 by @xmath39 where @xmath40 .    combining factors from eq . 
 ( 3.3 ) and eq . ( 3.4 ) we obtain the unitary mixing matrix , @xmath41 for the charged current weak interaction , @xmath42 this appears in the lagrangian term , @xmath43 where a conventional four component dirac notation with @xmath44 diagonal is being employed and @xmath35 has only the first two components non zero . 
 next we parameterize @xmath41@xcite . 
 it is possible to restrict @xmath45 by adjusting an overall phase which can be absorbed in @xmath46 . 
 then we write @xmath47 where @xmath48 with @xmath49 and , for example @xmath50 . 
 \label{3.9}\ ] ] eq . 
 ( 3.7 ) contains the eight parameters needed to characterize an arbitrary unitary unimodular matrix . from the standpoint of eq . 
 ( 3.6 ) it can be further simplified by using the freedom to rephase @xmath51 without changing the free part of the charged lepton lagrangian . on the other hand , the form of the mass terms in eq . 
 ( [ lfree ] ) shows that the neutrino fields can not be rephased . 
 thus a suitable minimal parameterization for @xmath41 in ( 3.6 ) is @xmath52 involving three  angles "" , @xmath53 and three  phases "" , @xmath54 . 
 note the identity @xmath55 this identity may be used to transfer two of the phases @xmath54 in eq . 
 ( 3.7 ) to a diagonal matrix on the right of @xmath41 as , for example , @xmath56 where @xmath57 , which may be used instead of eq . ( 3.10 ) . 
 we also need the formula for the amplitude of neutrino oscillation . for the case 
 when a neutrino , produced by a charged lepton of type @xmath15 ,  oscillates "" to make at time @xmath58 , a charged lepton of type @xmath16 , we have @xmath59 where the sum goes over the neutrinos of definite mass , @xmath60 . inserting the parameterization eq . 
 ( 3.12 ) into eq . 
 ( 3.13 ) shows that the effect of the factor @xmath61 cancels out . 
 thus for ordinary oscillations , @xmath41 is parameterized by three angles and one cp violating phase as for the ckm quark mixing matrix . on the other hand 
 , the two additional cp violating phases @xmath62 and @xmath63 show up if one considers neutrino - antineutrino oscillations @xcite or neutrinoless double beta decay @xcite . 
 the formula for the probability , @xmath64 is gotten by taking the squared magnitude of eq . 
 ( 3.13 ) and replacing the exponential factor @xmath65 by @xmath66 , where @xmath67 is the neutrino energy and @xmath68 is the oscillation distance . for practical reasons 
 it is very important to take account of the experimental uncertainties in @xmath67 and @xmath68 . 
 the simplest approximation@xcite is to define @xmath69 and assume that one can smear @xmath64 with a gaussian distribution in @xmath16 . 
 @xmath70 is defined as the mean value and @xmath71 as the standard deviation appropriate to the particular physical setup . 
 then we find for the smeared probability @xmath72 , \label{3.14}\end{aligned}\ ] ] where @xmath73 and @xmath74 . 
 notice that when @xmath75 , @xmath76 is independent of the sign of @xmath77 . 
 since @xmath78 provides only two real equations for 12 real parameters , it is clear that it has a relatively small amount of predictivity . 
 in particular it can not say much about the texture ( e.g. possible zeroes ) of @xmath0 which is suppposed to derive from a deeper theory than the standard model . on the other hand 
 , we shall see that our ansatz is complementary to the results which should emerge from analysis of neutrino oscillation experiments . 
 together , they should enable us to actually ( with some conditions ) reconstruct @xmath0 . 
 first , in this section , we shall consider @xmath0 to be hermitian so that the argument in favor of @xmath78 presented in section ii holds without any further assumptions . 
 since @xmath0 is symmetric it must be real . 
 it can be brought to real diagonal form via a real rotation @xmath79 as @xmath80 . 
 however there is no guarantee that all eigenvalues of @xmath0 will be positive . 
 we can make them all positive by rephasing the diagonal fields with negative eigenvalues by a factor @xmath81 ( see eqs . 
 ( 3.1 ) and ( 3.2 ) ) . 
 this means that the general diagonalizing matrix @xmath33 in eq . 
 ( 3.2 ) now takes the form @xmath82 where @xmath83 with @xmath84 for a positive eigenvalue and @xmath85 for a negative eigenvalue . 
 we notice that eq . 
 ( 4.1 ) is of the form eq . 
 ( 3.12 ) for which we already noticed that the factor @xmath86 cancels out in the neutrino oscillation formula eq . ( 3.14 ) . 
 furthermore only the square of the mass is relevant in eq . ( 3.14 ) . 
 thus we choose to work in this section with some negative masses and no factor @xmath86 in eq . 
 ( 4.1 ) .    to avoid confusion , we remark that the factor @xmath86 in eq . 
 ( 4.1 ) does _ not _ introduce any cp violation in the theory @xcite since @xmath0 is real in any event . 
 now let us suppose that an experimental analysis of all neutrino oscillation experiments is made based on a formula like eq . 
 ( 3.14 ) ( or one which treats the experimental uncertainties in a more sophisticated way ) . 
 furthermore assume that the cp violating phase @xmath87 in eq . 
 ( 3.12 ) is negligible . 
 then we should know the _ 
 magnitudes _ of the squared neutrino mass differences @xmath88 where @xmath89 and @xmath90 can be either positive or negative . then , assuming the leptonic theory to be cp conserving , our ansatz would imply @xmath91 where eq . ( 
 3.2 ) was used . 
 ( 4.2 ) and ( 4.3 ) comprise three equations for the three neutrino masses @xmath92 , @xmath93 and @xmath94 . 
 we can solve to get : @xmath95 , \\ 
 \nonumber m_2 & = & \frac { { b } - { \left ( m_1 \right)}^2}{2m_1 } , \\ 
 \nonumber m_3 & = & - m_1 - m_2 . 
 \label{4.4}\end{aligned}\ ] ] this leads to a limited number of solutions , depending on sign choices . 
 if we make the further assumption that the charged lepton mixing matrix @xmath96 in eq . 
 ( 3.4 ) is approximately the unit matrix ( this is expected to be a reasonable but not perfect approximation ) we can identify @xmath97 which would be obtained from experiment . 
 then , using the masses found in eq . 
 ( 4.4 ) , we could reconstruct @xmath0 as @xmath98    to proceed , we need only insert the experimental results for @xmath89 , @xmath90 and @xmath41 in ( 4.4 ) and ( 4.5 ) . of course , it is presumably the task of the next decade to solidify the experimental determination of these quantities . 
 we can , at the moment , only give a preliminary discussion . 
 for this purpose we will use the results of a recent preliminary analysis of all neutrino experiments by ohlsson and snellman @xcite . 
 these authors found , by a least square analysis , a best fit for ( our notation ) @xmath99 , @xmath100 and the leptonic mixing matrix @xmath41 . 
 they used the formula eq . 
 ( 3.14 ) with a suitable choice of @xmath70 and @xmath101 for each experiment . 
 furthermore , they made the simplifying assumption that @xmath41 is real . 
 finally they only searched for a fit in the range @xmath102 , @xmath103 . 
 this range corresponds to mass difference choices for which the msw effect @xcite for solar and atmospheric neutrinos is not expected to be important and so greatly simplifies the analysis . 
 thus there is no guarantee that the solution of @xcite is unique . 
 altogether they fit sixteen different solar neutrino , atmospheric neutrino , accelerator and reactor experiments , including lsnd . 
 the best fit is : @xmath104 for the squared mass differences and @xmath105 \label{4.7}\ ] ] for the lepton mixing matrix @xmath41 . 
 as discussed above we will identify @xmath106 here , keeping @xmath41 real but allowing for negative masses . 
 the best fit matrix k was obtained to be similar but not identical to the `` bimaximal mixing '' matrix @xcite .    with the best fit squared mass differences in eq . 
 ( 4.6 ) , our model predicts , from the first of eq . ( 4.4 ) , eight different possibilities . 
 these correspond to four different sign configurations for @xmath89 and @xmath90 times the two possible signs for @xmath92 . 
 however , only two of these eight are essentially different ; these are @xmath107 the other solutions correspond to interchanging whichever of @xmath108 and @xmath109 is greater ( which has only a negligible effect since they are almost degenerate ) or reversing the signs of all masses . 
 physically it is clear what is happening : the smallness of @xmath110 compared to @xmath111 in eq . 
 ( 4.2 ) forces @xmath112 . 
 then we have either @xmath113 with , using the constraint eq . 
 ( 4.3 ) , @xmath114 or @xmath115 with @xmath94 very small . 
 since we have assumed the neutrinos to be of majorana type for our plausibility argument in section ii , their interactions will violate lepton number 
 . then they should mediate neutrinoless double beta decay @xmath116 @xcite . 
 such a process has not yet been observed and an upper bound has been set for the relevant quantity @xmath117 the best upper bound at present is @xcite @xmath118 ev , reflecting some uncertainty in the estimation of the needed nuclear matrix elements .    substituting the best fit for the matrix k from eq . 
 ( 4.7 ) together with our results in eqs . ( 4.8 ) and ( 4.9 ) into eq . ( 4.10 ) yields predictions for the two cases : @xmath119 both solutions seem to be acceptable , the type i case marginally but the type ii case definitely . 
 note that the small value for @xmath120 in the type ii case is due to the best fit prediction @xcite @xmath121 and also to the fact that @xmath93 is negative . the same value would clearly result if we made @xmath93 positive and set @xmath122 as discussed around eq . 
 ( 4.1 ) above . 
 finally , let us reconstruct the underlying neutrino mass matrices for each of the two cases . 
 we use eq . 
 ( 4.5 ) based on the assumption that @xmath0 is real and also our ansatz to find ( in units of ev ) : @xmath123 , \\ { \rm type } \hskip 0.2 cm { \rm ii } : \quad m_\nu & = & m_\nu^t \approx \left [ \begin{array } { c c c } 6.7 \times 10^{-5 } & -0.9199&0.5078\\ -0.9199&0.0654&0.0410\\ 0.5078&0.0410&-0.0654\\ \end{array } \right ] . 
 \label{4.13}\end{aligned}\ ] ] the type i matrix does not have an excellent candidate for a `` texture '' zero . 
 however the small value of @xmath124 in the type ii case is certainly suggestive . 
 these matrices lead to neutrino masses and a mixing matrix which give a best fit to all present data . 
 it will be interesting to see if either of them hold up in the future .    incidentally , on comparing eqs . 
 ( 4.13 ) and ( 4.14 ) it is amusing to observe the large difference in two mass matrices `` generated '' in the same way except with respect to how @xmath125 is satisfied . 
 it seems interesting to also investigate the ansatz @xmath126 when @xmath0 is no longer restricted to be real . 
 this also raises the problem of constructing the unitary diagonalizing matrix @xmath33 in eq.(3.2 ) , in terms of the experimentally measured lepton mixing matrix @xmath127 . for simplicity , as 
 before , we will make the approximation that the charged lepton diagonalizing matrix @xmath96 is the unit matrix .    apart from an overall ( conventional ) phase we may write @xmath128 where the 2-parameter quantity @xmath129 was defined in eq . ( 
 3.8 ) . since @xmath127 has four parameters @xmath33 in eq . 
 ( 5.1 ) is described by eight parameters . 
 as mentioned before , the two parameters in @xmath61 are not measurable in neutrino oscillation experiments but show up when one considers @xmath130 . 
 the two parameters in @xmath131 may be eliminated , for experimental purposes , by rephasing the charged leptons . however , for the theoretical purpose of reconstructing the underlying neutrino mass matrix @xmath0 , their existence can not be ruled out . 
 ( they also do not contribute to @xmath132 . )    for the purpose of relating the ansatz on @xmath0 to the physical neutrino masses in @xmath133 , we note    @xmath134    for further simplicity of the analysis we adopt the special case @xmath135 and also identify @xmath127 with the real best fit in eq . 
 ( 4.7 ) ; our ansatz now reads    @xmath136    with the redefinitions @xmath137 and @xmath138 , eq . 
 ( 5.3 ) becomes @xmath139 this may be conveniently visualized as the vector triangle shown in fig . 
 [ trianglefig ] .    combining eqs . 
 ( 5.4 ) and ( 4.2 ) gives four real equations for the five unknown quantities ( @xmath140 ) . 
 thus we have ( for each set of ( @xmath141 ) sign choices ) a one parameter family of solutions . 
 it is convenient to choose this parameter to be @xmath94 
 . then @xmath92 and @xmath93 may be found from the equations ( 4.2 ) , provided that solutions exist . in this way 
 all three sides of the triangle in fig.[trianglefig ] are determined . 
 the angles may finally be found as @xmath142    we also need to investigate the constraint arising from the non - observation of @xmath132 . 
 ( 4.10 ) now becomes , with eq . 
 ( 5.1 ) as the mixing matrix @xmath143    using the ansatz constraint eq . 
 ( 5.4 ) , eq . ( 5.6 ) may be rewritten as @xmath144 m_2 e^{-i\beta_2 } + \left [ ( k_{exp\hskip .2 cm 13})^2 - ( k_{exp\hskip .2 cm 11})^2   \right ] m_3 \right|.\ ] ] this form is very convenient when identifying @xmath127 with the best fit solution in eq . 
 ( 4.7 ) . in the present context such an identification corresponds to cp violation for the @xmath132 process but not for usual neutrino oscillations . since the ( 11 ) and ( 12 ) matrix elements are equal in eq . 
 ( 4.7 ) we find the simple result @xmath145 thus if the upper bound on @xmath146 is conservatively identified as in the @xmath147 ev range , we should have in this case @xmath148 in the present complex case there is a continuum of possible solutions labelled by those values of @xmath94 satisfying eq . 
 ( 5.9 ) , rather than just the two possibilities found in eq . ( 4.8 ) and eq . ( 4.9 ) . 
 actually , the continuum separates roughly into two classes similar to either eq . 
 ( 4.8 ) or eq . ( 4.9 ) . in the generalized type i class 
 , @xmath94 is of the order @xmath149 ev while @xmath92 and @xmath93 are related to nearly oppositely directed vectors in fig . 
 [ trianglefig ] and are also of the order @xmath90 . in the generalized type ii class , @xmath90 is negative ; @xmath92 and @xmath93 correspond to vectors of order @xmath150 which are oppositely directed to each other , while @xmath94 ranges from very small to order @xmath100 . 
 given the bound eq . 
 ( 5.9 ) from the non - observation of @xmath130 , there are important limitations on the allowed @xmath94 values for type i solutions . in this case 
 @xmath90 is positive so the equation @xmath151 will only allow solutions for @xmath152 ev . 
 this range is barely compatible with eq . 
 thus the type ii case where @xmath153 and @xmath154 seems most probable .    as an example of a solution for complex @xmath0 , 
 consider choosing @xmath155 ev 
 . then a solution is obtained with ( compare with fig . 
 [ trianglefig ] )    @xmath156    the matrix @xmath33 , which diagonalizes @xmath0 is obtained from eq . 
 ( 5.1 ) , with the approximation @xmath157 , and with now : @xmath158 this factor introduces cp violation in the @xmath132 process but not in ordinary neutrino oscillations .    finally the underlying neutrino mass matrix , @xmath159 is `` reconstructed '' as ( in units of ev ) : @xmath160.\ ] ] this is structurally similar to the real type ii solution displayed in eq . ( 4.14 ) , although the suppression of the ( 11 ) element is not so pronounced . 
 notice that @xmath94 is considerably smaller than the almost degenerate pair @xmath92 and @xmath93 . 
 furthermore @xmath92 and @xmath93 are large enough to possibly play some role in astrophysics . 
 we investigated the ansatz @xmath78 for the underlying ( pre - diagonal ) three generation neutrino mass matrix . 
 it was motivated by noting that in an so(10 ) grand unified model where @xmath0 was taken to be real ( cp conserving ) , it corresponds to the well known unification of b quark and @xmath161 lepton masses . while not very predictive by itself it yields information complementary to what would be gotten from a complete three flavor analysis of all lepton number conserving neutrino oscillation experiments . specifically from the specification of the magnitudes of two neutrino squared mass differences and also of the leptonic mixing matrix we can 
 , with some assumptions , find the neutrino masses themselves and `` reconstruct '' @xmath0 . 
 this determination can be sharpened by consideration of the constraints imposed by non - observation of neutrinoless double beta decay . 
 for the purpose of testing our ansatz we employed the results of a reasonable best fit to all present neutrino experiments ( including lsnd ) by ohlsson and snellmann @xcite . 
 this fit will inevitably be improved in the next few years as new experiments are completed . 
 they were able to fit the data without assuming any cp violation . 
 this agrees with assuming @xmath0 to be real . 
 we found two essentially different solutions in that case . 
 the first features two neutrinos having approximately equal mass 0.608 ev and a third neutrino of mass 1.217 ev . 
 this solution is on the borderline of being ruled out by non - observation of @xmath162 . 
 the second solution has two neutrinos with approximately degenerate mass 1.054 ev and a third neutrino with a mass @xmath163 ev . 
 this solution is very safe from being ruled out by @xmath164 experiments . 
 it also features a reconstructed @xmath0 which has an extremely small ( 11 ) element . 
 note that , for both solutions , even though @xmath0 is real there are some ( cp conserving ) factors of @xmath81 in the mixing matrix when all masses are taken to be positive . 
 alternatively one may have no @xmath81 s in the mixing matrix while allowing some masses to be negative . 
 the latter form is useful for seeing intuitively how @xmath165=0 is possible . 
 the case of matching the above best fit data to a complex @xmath0 was also considered . in this situation there are cp violating phases in the lepton mixing matrix which affect the @xmath132 process but do not affect ordinary total lepton number conserving neutrino oscillations . 
 such phases could also be measurable in principle with the observation of a decay like @xmath166 . 
 the case of complex @xmath0 allows a larger number of solutions . with a simplifying assumption 
 there is a one parameter family of allowed neutrino mass sets . 
 roughly , these fall into one of the two types already encountered for real @xmath0 .    a question of some interest is whether the neutrinos are massive enough to play a role in cosmology . 
 the relevant criterion @xcite for this to occur is usually stated as @xmath167 ev . 
 for the type ii solutions with complex @xmath0 we have found the largest mass sum to be about 4.5 ev corresponding to @xmath168 ev and @xmath169 ev . 
 however this is on the very border of acceptability for non observation of @xmath132 .

"half - metallic ferromagnets with high ( room temperature and above ) curie temperatures @xmath1 are ideal for spintronics applications , and as such , much experimental and theoretical@xcite effort has been devoted in recent years to the designing of and search for such materials . among these , 
 cr - doped dilute magnetic semiconductors ( dms ) @xcite or cr - based alloys and in particular cras and crsb @xcite in zinc blende(zb ) structure have attracted particular attention , not only because of the possibility of complete spin polarization of the carriers at the fermi level , but also for their possible high @xmath1 . 
 akinaga @xcite were able to grow zb thin films of cras on gaas ( 001 ) substrates by molecular beam epitaxy , which showed ferromagnetic behavior at temperatures in excess of 400 k and magnetic moments of 3@xmath2 per cras unit . 
 theoretical calculations by akinaga @xcite and several other theoretical calculations since then @xcite have verified the half - metallic character of cras . 
 the high value of @xmath1 has also been supported by some of these studies@xcite . 
 thin films of crsb grown by solid - source molecular beam epitaxy on gaas , ( al , ga)sb , and gasb have been found to be of zb structure and ferromagnetic with @xmath1 higher than 400 k@xcite . 
 galanakis and mavropoulos@xcite , motivated by the successful fabrication of zb cras , crsb and mnas@xcite , have examined the possibility of half - metallic behavior in ordered zb compounds of transition metals v , cr and mn with the @xmath3 elements n , p , as , sb , s , se and te . 
 their theoretical study shows that the half - metallic ferromagnetic character of these compounds is preserved over a wide range of lattice parameters . 
 they also found that the half - metallic character is maintained for the transition element terminated ( 001 ) surfaces of these systems . 
 yamana @xcite have studied the effects of tetragonal distortion on zb cras and crsb and found the half - metallicity to survive large tetragonal distortions . 
 of course , the ground states of many of these compounds in the bulk are known to be different from the zb structure , the most common structure being the hexagonal nias - type . 
 zhao and zunger@xcite have argued that zb mnas , cras , crsb , and crte are epitaxially unstable against the nias structure , and zb crse is epitaxially stable only for lattice constants higher than 6.2  , remaining half - metallic at such volumes . 
 they also find that even though the ground state of crs is zb , it is antiferromagnetic at equilibrium lattice parameter , and thus not half - metallic . 
 these results reveal the challenge experimentalists face in synthesizing these compounds in zb structure . 
 however , the possibility remains open that such difficulties will be overcome with progress in techniques of film - growth and materials preparation in general . 
 recently , deng @xcite were successful in increasing the thickness of zb - crsb films to @xmath4 3 nm by molecular beam epitaxy using ( in , ga)as buffer layers , and li @xcite were able to grow @xmath4 4 nm thick zb - crsb films on nacl ( 100 ) substrates .    in view of the above situation regarding the state of experimental fabrication of these compounds and available theoretical results , it would be appropriate to study the variation of magnetic properties , particularly exchange interactions and the curie temperature , of cr - based pnictides and chalcogenides as a function of the lattice parameter . towards this goal , 
 we have carried out such calculations for the compounds crx ( x = as , sb , s , se and te ) and the mixed alloys cras@xmath0x@xmath0 with x = sb , s , se and te . 
 essentially we study the effect of anion doping by choosing elements of similar atomic sizes ( neighboring elements in the periodic table ) , one of which , namely sb , is isoelectronic to as , while the others ( s , se , te ) bring one more valence electron to the system . 
 the mixed pnictide - chalcogenide systems offer further opportunity to study the effects of anion doping . 
 the alloying with other 3d transition metals ( both magnetic , e.g. fe or mn , or non - magnetic , e.g. v ) on cation sublattice would also change the carrier concentration and bring about strong d - disorder which can additionally modify the shape of the fermi surface . 
 this , however , is not the subject of the present paper . 
 almost all theoretical studies on these alloys so far address aspects of electronic structure and stability of these alloys only . 
 although a few theoretical estimates of exchange interactions and the curie temperature for cras at equilibrium lattice parameter have appeared in the literature , a detailed study of the volume dependence of these quantities is missing . for the other alloys , crsb , 
 crs , crse and crte , no theoretical results for the exchange interaction , curie temperature and their volume dependence exist at present . 
 the mixed pnictide - chalcogenide systems offer the possibility of not only creating these alloys over a larger range of the lattice parameter , but also with a larger variation in the exchange interactions . 
 this is because at low values of the lattice parameter the dominant cr - cr exchange interactions in the chalcogenides can be antiferromagnetic , while for the pnictides they are ferromagnetic . 
 the pnictide - chalcogenide alloying is important from the experimental viewpoint of stabilizing the zb structure on a given substrate , via the matching of the lattice parameter of the film with that of the latter . 
 although the present study is confined to the zb structure only , we hope that it will provide some guidance to the experimentalists in their search and growth of materials suitable for spintronic devices . 
 electronic and magnetic properties of crx ( x = as , sb , s , se and te ) and cras@xmath0x@xmath0 ( x= sb , s , se and te ) were calculated for lattice parameters varying between 5.45 and 6.6  , appropriate for some typical ii - vi and iii - v semiconducting substrates . 
 calculations were performed using the tb - lmto - cpa method@xcite and the exchange - correlation potential given by vosko , wilk and nusair@xcite . in our lmto calculation 
 we optimize the asa ( atomic sphere approximation ) errors by including empty spheres in the unit cell . 
 we use the fcc unit cell , with cr and x ( as , sb , s , se and te ) atoms located at ( 0,0,0 ) and ( 0.25,0.25,0.25 ) , respectively , and empty spheres at locations ( 0.5,0.5,0.5 ) and ( -0.25,-0.25,-0.25 ) . for several cases , 
 we have checked the accuracy of the lmto - asa electronic structures against the full - potential lmto results@xcite and found them to be satisfactory . for the mixed alloys cras@xmath0x@xmath0 ( x= sb , 
 s , se and te ) , the as - sublattice of the zb cras structure is assumed to be randomly occupied by equal concentration of as and x atoms . 
 the disorder in this sublattice is treated under the coherent potential approximation ( cpa)@xcite . 
 our spin - polarized calculations assume a collinear magnetic model . in 
 the following we will present results referred to as fm and dlm . 
 the fm results follow from the usual spin - polarized calculations , where self - consistency of charge- and spin - density yields a nonzero magnetization per unit cell . 
 although we call this the fm result , our procedure does not guarantee that the true ground state of the system is ferromagnetic , with the magnetic moments of all the unit cells perfectly aligned . 
 this is because we have not explored non - collinear magnetic states , nor all antiferromagnetic ( afm ) states attainable within the collinear model . 
 indeed , our results for the exchange interactions in some cases do suggest the ground states being of afm or complex magnetic nature . for lack of a suitable label 
 , we refer to all spin - polarized calculations giving a nonzero local moment as fm state calculations . within the stoner model , a nonmagnetic state above the curie temperature @xmath1 
 would be characterized by the vanishing of the local moments in magnitude . 
 it is well - known and universally accepted that the neglect of the transversal spin fluctuations in the stoner model leads to an unphysical picture of the nonmagnetic state and a gross overestimate of @xmath1 . 
 an alternate description of the nonmagnetic state is provided by the disordered local moment ( dlm ) model , where the local moments remain nonzero in magnitude above @xmath1 , but disorder in magnitude as well as their direction above @xmath1 causes the global magnetic moment to vanish . 
 combining aspects of the stoner model and an itinerant heisenberg - like model , heine and co - workers@xcite have developed a suitable criterion for a dlm state to be a more appropriate description of the nonmagnetic state than what is given by the stoner model . within the collinear magnetic model , where all local axes of spin - quantization point in the same direction , dlm can be treated as a binary alloy problem and 
 thus described using the coherent potential approximation ( cpa)@xcite . we have carried out such dlm calculations , assuming the cr - sublattice to be randomly occupied by an equal number of cr atoms with oppositely directed magnetic moments . 
 the object for performing the dlm calculations is two - fold . 
 if the total energy in a dlm calculation is lower than the corresponding fm calculation , we can safely assume that the ground state ( for the given lattice parameter and structure ) is not fm , albeit of unknown magnetic structure . 
 the exchange interactions in the dlm state can also be used to compute estimates of @xmath1 , and such estimates of @xmath1 may be considered as estimates from above the magnetic - nonmagnetic transition . 
 @xmath1 computed from exchange interactions in the fm state are estimates from below the transition . 
 of course , if the ground state is known to be ferromagnetic , then estimates of @xmath1 based on exchange interactions in the fm reference state are the appropriate ones to consider .    in some cases where the fm results point to the possibility of the ground state magnetic structure being afm or of complex nature 
 , we have carried out a limited number of afm calculations to provide some insight into this problem ( see section [ subsec : stabilityjq ] ) . 
 we have computed the spin - resolved densities of states ( dos ) for all the alloys for varying lattice parameters , and for both the fm and dlm configurations . 
 the fm calculations show half - metallic character , due to the formation of bonding and antibonding states involving the @xmath5 orbitals of the cr - atoms and the @xmath3 orbitals of the neighboring pnictogen ( as , sb ) or chalcogen ( s , se , te ) . 
 the hybridization gap is different and takes place in different energy regions in the two spin channels . 
 the critical values of the lattice parameters above which the fm calculations show half - metallic character agree well with those reported by galanakis and mavropoulos@xcite . 
 the dos for the alloys of the type crx ( x = sb , s , se , te ) have been presented by several other authors@xcite and thus will not be shown here . in figs.[fig1 ] and [ fig2 ] we show the dos for the mixed alloys cras@xmath0sb@xmath0 and cras@xmath0se@xmath0 , for lattice parameters above and below the critical values for the half - metallic character . according to galanakis and mavropoulos@xcite , half - metallicity in zb cras appears between the lattice parameters of 5.45 and 5.65  . 
 the latter corresponds to the lattice parameter of the gaas substrate . for crsb 
 half - metallicity appears at a lattice parameter between 5.65 and 5.87  . 
 the mixed alloy cras@xmath0sb@xmath0 , as shown in fig.[fig1 ] , is not quite half - metallic at the lattice parameter of 5.65  , and fully half - metallic at the lattice parameter of 5.76  . 
 replacing sb with se in the above alloy , i.e. for cras@xmath0se@xmath0 , brings the critical lattice parameter down slightly . as shown in fig.[fig2 ] , at a lattice parameter of 5.65  , cras@xmath0se@xmath0 is half - metallic , although barely so . in our calculation 
 crs and crse are half - metallic at a lattice parameter of 5.65  , and not so at a lattice parameter of 5.55  . 
 crte is not half - metallic at a lattice parameter of 5.76  , but at a lattice parameter of 5.87  . 
 for both crs and crse the critical value should be close to 5.65  , and for crte it should be close to 5.87  .    note that in general the half - metallic gap is larger in the chalcogenides than in the pnictides . 
 this is due to larger cr - moment ( see section [ sec : mag.mom . 
 ] ) for the chalcogenides , which results in larger exchange splitting . 
 this explains the difference in the half - metallic gaps in figs . 
 [ fig1 ] and [ fig2 ] for similar lattice parameters .    fig . 
 [ fig3 ] compares the total dos of cras for the fm and dlm calculations for the equilibrium lattice parameter 5.65  . 
 higher dos at the fermi level for the dlm calculation , compared with the fm calculation , is an indication that the band energy is lower in the fm state . indeed , as indicated in table [ table1 ] , compared with the dlm state the total energy for zb cras is lower in the fm state for the lattice parameters from 5.44 to 5.98  . 
 in fact , this holds for lattice parameters up to 6.62  , showing the robustness of ferromagnetism in cras over a wide range of the lattice parameter . 
 this is also true for crsb .

 width=360 ]     for the dlm and fm states.,width=360 ]    in table [ table1 ] we show the variation of total energies per atom in ry with the lattice parameter for crx ( x = as , sb , s , se and te ) in the dlm and fm states . 
 the purpose of tabulating these energies is not to determine the bulk equilibrium lattice parameters in the zb structure , as this has already been done by several authors@xcite . 
 our results for equilibrium zb phase lattice parameters agree with those found by galanakis and mavropoulos@xcite . 
 the important point is that for crs and crse at low values of lattice parameters the dlm energies are lower than the fm energies , showing clearly that the fm configuration is unstable . 
 the result for crs is in line with the observation by zhao and zunger@xcite , who find zb crs to be antiferromagnetic with an equilibrium lattice parameter of 5.37  . 
 as shown later ( section [ sec : exchange ] ) , the exchange coupling constants for the cr atoms in the fm calculations are negative , indicating the instability of the ferromagnetic spin alignment . the tendency to antiferromagnetism in crse at compressed lattice parameters 
 is also revealed in a study by sasaio@xmath7lu @xcite for crte at lower lattice parameters the fm energy is lower than the dlm energy , but the exchange constants for the cr - atoms in the fm calculations are still negative ( see discussion in section [ sec : exchange ] ) , signaling the possibility of the ground states in crte at low values of the lattice parameter being neither dlm nor fm . 
 note that in our discussion ground state implies the lowest energy state in zb structure . for crs , 
 crse and crte the ground states at low lattice parameters can be of an antiferromagnetic ( afm ) or complex magnetic structure . 
 a lower total energy may also mean a lower band energy , and in some cases , the latter may be reflected in a lower density of states at the fermi level . 
 this is shown in fig.[fig4 ] , where for crs at the lowest lattice parameter of 5.44 @xmath6 the dos at the fermi level is lower in the dlm state than in the fm state . 
 the deviation from ferromagnetism at low values of the lattice parameter for crs , crse and crte is also revealed by our study of the lattice fourier transform of the exchange interaction between the cr atoms in the fm state ( section [ sec : exchange ] ) . 
 the search for an antiferromagnetic state with lower energy is possible within our collinear magnetic model by enlarging the unit cell in various ways . 
 we have pursued this issue to a limited extent , by considering 001 , 111 afm configurations for crs , crse and crte at low values of the lattice parameter ( see discussion in section[sec : exchange ] ) . 
 a satisfactory resolution of such issues is possible only by going beyond the collinear model .

 our spin - polarized calculations for the fm reference states lead to local moments not only on the cr atoms , but also on the other atoms ( as , sb , s , se , and te ) as well as the empty spheres . 
 sandratskii @xcite have discussed the problem associated with such induced moments in case of the heusler alloy nimnsb and the hexagonal phase of mnas . usually such systems can be divided into sublattices with robust magnetic moments and sublattices where moment is induced under the influence of the former . 
 these authors argue that the treatment of the induced moments as independent variables in a heisenberg hamiltonian may lead to artificial features in the spin - wave spectra , but these artificial features do not drastically affect the calculated curie temperatures of the two alloys , nimnsb and hexagonal mnas . clearly , in our case the sublattice with the robust magnetic moment is the cr - sublattice . among the three other sublattices , 
 the magnitudes of the induced moments decrease in the following order for the two robust ferromagnets cras and crsb : x - sublattice ( x = as , sb ) , sublattice es-1 ( the sublattice of empty spheres that is at the same distance with respect to the cr - sublattice as the x - sublattice ) , sublattice es-2 ( sublattice of empty spheres further away from the cr - sublattice ) . 
 this trend is particularly valid for low values of the lattice parameter . 
 the induced moments originate from the tails of the orbitals ( primarily @xmath8 ) on the nearby cr - atoms . 
 this is particularly true for the moments induced on the empty spheres . 
 the magnitudes of the induced moments on the two empty sphere sublattices decrease as the lattice parameter increases , and so do the differences in their magnitudes . 
 the signs of the moments on es-1 and es-2 may be the same for small lattice parameters , but are opposite for large lattice parameters . 
 the sign of the moment on the x - sublattice is opposite to that on the cr - sublattice and the magnitudes of the moments on the two sublattices increase with increasing lattice parameters , due to decreased hybridization between cr-@xmath8 and x-@xmath3 orbitals . above a critical value of the lattice parameter , the moment per formula unit ( f.u . ) 
 saturates at a value of 3.0 @xmath2 , as the half - metallic state is achieved , while the local moments on the cr- and x - sublattices increase in magnitude , remaining opposite in sign . 
 the maximum ratio between the induced moment on x ( x = as , sb ) and the moment on cr is 0.18 for cras and 0.15 for crsb , occurring at the highest lattice parameter of 6.62 @xmath6 studied . the maximum ratio between the induced moment on es-1 and that on cr is 0.06 , occurring at the lowest lattice parameter of 5.44 @xmath6 studied . 
 magnetic moments of cras and crsb per formula unit ( f.u . ) as well as the local moment at the cr site are shown in fig . 
 [ fig5 ] , where we compare the two compounds with each other for their magnetic moments in the fm and dlm states . 
 the same results are presented in fig . 
 [ fig6 ] , comparing the moment per f.u.in the fm state with the cr local moment in the fm and dlm states separately for each compound . 
 it is to be noted that there are no induced moments for the dlm reference states , i.e. the moments on the non - cr sublattices are several orders of magnitude smaller than the robust moment on the cr atoms . 
 the total moment per formula unit in the dlm state is zero by construction . 
 the local moment on the cr atom for the dlm reference state is usually less than the corresponding fm value for smaller lattice parameters , and larger for larger lattice parameters ( fig.[fig6 ] ) . 
 similar trends in the variation of the local moment on cr and the induced moments on the other sublattices for the fm reference states as a function of lattice parameter are revealed for crx ( x = s , se , te ) , except that the moments on es-1 are always an order of magnitude larger than those on es-2 . 
 i addition , the induced moments on es-2 are @xmath9 times larger than those on x sublattice for smaller values of the lattice parameter , with the two becoming comparable in magnitude for larger lattice parameters . 
 the induced moments on es-1 and x - sublattices are never larger than @xmath4 5% of the moment on the cr atoms . 
 the induced moments for the dlm reference states are several orders of magnitude smaller than the cr - moments , and can be safely assumed to be zero . 
 results for zb crs , crse and crte are presented in figs.[fig7 ] and [ fig8 ] . 
 the moment per f.u . reaches the saturation values of 4@xmath2 for crs , crse , and crte in the half - metallic state , as discussed in detail by galanakis and mavropoulos@xcite . 
 the saturation values of the moments for all these alloys ( crx , x = as , sb , s , se , and te ) satisfy the so - called `` rule of 8 '' : @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the total number of valence electrons in the unit cell . 
 the number 8 accounts for the fact that in the half - metallic state the bonding @xmath12 bands are full , accommodating 6 electrons and so is the low - lying band formed of the @xmath13 electrons from the @xmath3 atom , accommodating 2 electrons . 
 the magnetic moment then comes from the remaining electrons filling the @xmath8 states , first the @xmath14 states and then the @xmath5 . 
 the saturation value of 3@xmath2/f.u . , or the half - metallic state , appears for a larger critical lattice constant in crsb than in cras . 
 similarly , the critical lattice constants for the saturation magnetic moment of 4@xmath2/f.u . 
 are in increasing order for crs , crse and crte . 
 the local moment on the cr atom can be less / more than the saturation value , depending on the moment induced on the non - cr atoms and empty spheres . 
 -[fig8 ] ) , fm calculations produce induced moments on non - cr spheres representing the x - atoms ( x = as , sb , s , se , te ) , and one set of empty spheres . 
 the dlm calculations produce no such induced moments , i.e. , the moments reside on the cr - atoms only . 
 see text for discussion.,width=360 ]                fig.[fig9 ] shows the variation of the magnetic moment with the lattice parameter for the random alloys cras@xmath0x@xmath0 ( x = sb , s , se , te ) , where 50% of the as - sublattice is randomly occupied by x - atoms . 
 the saturation moment per f.u . 
 for cras@xmath0sb@xmath0 in the half - metallic state is 3@xmath2 , with the results falling between those for cras and crsb shown in fig.[fig6 ] . for cras@xmath0x@xmath0 ( x = s , se , te ) , the saturation moment per f.u . is 3.5@xmath2 . 
 the local cr - moment deviates from the saturation value in the half - metallic state , being higher than the saturation value for all lattice parameters above 6.1 .        from figs.[fig5]-[fig9 
 ] it is clear that the magnetic moment per formula unit is closer to the magnetic moment of the cr atoms in the fm calculations than in the dlm calculations . 
 local cr - moments in the dlm calculations are suppressed w.r.t . 
 the fm results for low lattice parameters and enhanced for larger lattice parameters . as shown in table [ table1 ] the total energy of the fm state is lower than that of the corresponding dlm state in almost all cases , except for some compressed lattice parameters for crs and crse . 
 however , the consideration of the dlm state does provide an advantage in that there are no associated induced moments , i.e. , the dlm calculations produce moments that reside on the robust magnetic sublattice only . 
 mapping of the total energy on to a heisenberg hamiltonian , therefore , does not result in exchange interactions involving atoms / spheres with induced moments and all associated artificial / non - physical features referred to by sandratskii @xcite 
 currently , most _ first - principles _ studies of the thermodynamic properties of itinerant magnetic systems proceed via mapping @xcite the system energy onto a classical heisenberg model : @xmath15 where @xmath16 are site indices , @xmath17 is the unit vector pointing along the direction of the local magnetic moment at site @xmath18 , and @xmath19 is the exchange interaction between the moments at sites @xmath18 and @xmath20 . 
 the validity of this procedure is justified on the basis of the adiabatic hypothesis- the assumption that the magnetic moment directions are slow variables on all the characteristic electronic time scales relevant to the problem , and thus can be treated as classical parameters . the energy of the system for a given set of magnetic moment directions is usually calculated via methods based on density functional theory ( dft ) . 
 one of the most widely used mapping procedures is due to liechtenstein @xcite it involves writing the change in the energy due to the deviation of a single spin from a reference state in an analytic form using the multiple scattering formalism and by appealing to the magnetic variant of the andersen force theorem@xcite . 
 the force theorem , derived originally for the change of total energy due to a deformation in a solid , dictates that the differences in the energies of various magnetic configurations can be approximated by the differences in the band energies alone@xcite . 
 the energy of a magnetic excitation related to the rotation of a local spin - quantization direction can be calculated from the spinor rotation of the ground state potential . 
 no self - consistent calculation for the excited state is necessary . 
 a second approach is based on the total energy calculations for a set of collinear magnetic structures , and extracting the exchange parameters by mapping the total energies to those coming from the heisenberg model given by eq.([e1 ] ) . 
 such calculations can be done using any of the standard dft methods . however , unlike the magnetic force theorem method , where the exchange interactions can be calculated directly for a given structure and between any two sites , several hypothetical magnetic configurations and sometimes large supercells need to be considered to obtain the values of a modest number of exchange interactions . in addition , some aspects of environment - dependence of exchange interactions are often simply ignored . 
 the difference between these two approaches is , in essence , the same as that between the generalized perturbation method ( gpm)@xcite and the connolly - williams method@xcite in determining the effective pair interactions in ordered and disordered alloys . 
 a third approach is a variant of the second approach , where the energies of the system in various magnetic configurations corresponding to spin - waves of different wave - vectors are calculated by employing the generalized bloch theorem for spin - spirals@xcite . 
 the inter - atomic exchange interactions can be calculated by equating these energies to the fourier transforms of the classical heisenberg - model energies . 
 this approach , known as the frozen magnon approach , is similar to the frozen phonon approach for the study of lattice vibrations in solids .    in this work , 
 we have used the method of liechtenstein , which was later implemented for random magnetic systems by turek , using cpa and the tb - lmto method@xcite . the exchange integral in eq.([e1 ] ) 
 is given by @xmath21 dz \ ; , \ ] ] where @xmath22 represents the complex energy variable , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 , representing the difference in the potential functions for the up and down spin electrons at site @xmath18. in the present work @xmath25 represents the matrix elements of the green s function of the medium for the up and down spin electrons . 
 for sublattices with disorder , this is a configurationally averaged green s function , obtained via using the prescription of cpa . 
 the integral in this work is performed in the complex energy plane , where the contour includes the fermi energy @xmath26 . 
 the quantity @xmath19 given by eq . 
 ( [ eq - jij ] ) includes direct- , indirect- , double - exchange and superexchange interactions , which are often treated separately in model calculations . the negative sign in eq.([e1 ] ) 
 implies that positive and negative values of @xmath19 are to be interpreted as representing ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic interactions , respectively . 
 a problem with the mapping of the total energy to a classical heisenberg hamiltonian following the approach of liechtenstein @xcite is that it generates exchange interactions between sites , where one or both may carry induced moment(s ) . 
 of course this problematic scenario appears only for the fm reference states , as the dlm reference states do not generate induced moments . in the present work the liechtenstein mapping procedure , applied to fm reference sates , 
 generates exchange interactions between the cr atoms , between cr and other atoms x ( x = as , sb , s , se , te ) , and also between cr atoms and the nearest empty spheres es-1 . depending on the lattice parameter , this latter interaction is either stronger than or at least comparable to that for the cr - x pairs . the exchange interactions between cr atoms and the furthest empty spheres es-2 are always about one or two orders of magnitude smaller than the cr - es1 interactions and can be neglected . in cras , 
 the ratio of the nearest neighbor cr - es1 to cr - cr interaction varies from 0.2 - 0.25 at low lattice parameters to 0.06 - 0.07 at high values of the lattice parameter . in crsb , these ratios are smaller , varying between 0.14 and 0.05 . 
 the cr - es1 exchange interactions are also relatively strong in magnitude in crs , crse and crte . 
 one important point is that while these interactions are positive for nearest neighbors for all lattice parameters , cr - cr nearest neighbor interaction is negative for low values of lattice parameters in crs and crse . in crte 
 , this interaction changes sign from positive to negative and then back , as the lattice parameter is varied in the range 5.44 - 6.62  . 
 as mentioned earlier , the calculation for the dlm reference states do not produce induced moments , and thus no exchange interactions other than those between the cr atoms . 
 sandratskii@xcite have discussed the case when , in addition to the interaction between the strong moments , there is one secondary , but much weaker , interaction between the strong and one induced moment . in this case , the curie temperature , calculated under the mean - field approximation ( mfa ) , seems to be enhanced due to this secondary interaction , irrespective of the sign of the secondary interaction . in other words , the curie temperature would be somewhat higher than that calculated by considering only the interaction between the strong moments . 
 the corresponding results under the random phase approximation ( rpa ) have to be obtained by solving two equations simultaneously . 
 one can assume that the rpa results for the curie temperature follow the trends represented by the mfa results , being only somewhat smaller , as observed in the absence of induced moments . in our case 
 , since there are at least two secondary interactions ( cr - x and cr - es1 ) to consider in addition to the main cr - cr interaction , the influence of these secondary interactions is definitely more complex .    in view of the above - described situation involving secondary interactions between cr- and the induced moments for the fm reference states , we have adopted the following strategy . since no induced moments appear in calculations for the dlm reference states , the curie temperature @xmath1 for these can be calculated as usual from the exchange interaction between the cr - atoms , i.e. the strong moments . 
 for these cases the calculation of @xmath1 can proceed in a straightforward manner by making use of the mean - field approximation ( mfa ) or the more accurate random - phase approximation ( rpa)@xcite . 
 one can obtain the mfa estimate of the curie temperature from @xmath27 where the sum extends over all the neighboring shells . 
 an improved description of finite - temperature magnetism is provided by the rpa , with @xmath28 given by @xmath29^{-1 }   \ , .\ ] ] here @xmath30 denotes the order of the translational group applied and @xmath31 is the lattice fourier transform of the real - space exchange integrals @xmath32 . 
 it can be shown that @xmath33 is always smaller than @xmath34 @xcite . 
 it has been shown that the rpa curie temperatures are usually close to those obtained from monte - carlo simulations @xcite . 
 as shown by sandratskii @xcite the calculation of @xmath1 using rpa is considerably more involved even for the case where only one secondary interaction needs to be considered , in addition to the principal interaction between the strong moments . 
 the complexity of the problem increases even for mfa , if more than one secondary interaction is to be considered . 
 the same comment applies to stability analysis using the lattice fourier transform of the exchange interactions . 
 the deviation of the nature of the ground state from a collinear and parallel alignment of the cr moments in the fm reference states could be studied by examining the lattice fourier transform of the exchange interaction between the cr atoms : @xmath35 , if all the secondary interactions could be ignored . 
 this is definitely not possible for many of our fm results , where several pairs of interaction need to be considered , and @xmath36 is a matrix bearing a complicated relationship to the energy as a function of the wave - vector * q*. thus , in the following the results for @xmath1 will be presented mostly for the dlm reference states . for comparison , in a small number of cases we will present @xmath1 calculated for the fm reference states using only the cr - cr exchange interactions as the input . of course 
 , this will be done with caution only for cases where we have reason to believe that the results are at least qualitatively correct . 
 some fm results will also be included towards the stability analysis based on @xmath36 derived from cr - cr interactions only . again , this will be done with caution , only if the corresponding results can be shown to be meaningful via additional calculations .      the cr - cr exchange interactions for all the alloys studied and for both fm and dlm reference states become negligible as the inter - atomic distance reaches about three lattice parameters or , equivalently , thirty neighbor shells . 
 the same applies to the cr - x and cr - es interactions for the fm cases , these interactions in general being somewhat smaller . 
 the cr - cr interactions for the dlm reference states are more damped compared with the corresponding fm results , showing less fluctuations in both sign and magnitude . 
 the distance dependence of the exchange interactions between the cr atoms in cras is shown in fig.[fig10 ] for several lattice parameters . 
 although the nearest neighbor interaction is always positive ( i.e , of ferromagnetic nature ) , the interactions with more distant neighbors are sometimes antiferromagnetic . 
 such antiferromagnetic interactions are more common in cras for lower lattice parameters . 
 with increasing lattice parameter , interactions become predominantly ferromagnetic , and by the time the equilibrium lattice parameter of 5.52 @xmath6 is reached , antiferromagnetic interactions mostly disappear . 
 we have calculated such interactions up to the 405th neighbor shell , which amounts to a distance of roughly 8 lattice parameters . 
 although the interactions themselves are negligible around and after the 30@xmath37 neighbor shell , their influence on the lattice sums continues up to about 100 neighbor shells . by about the neighbor 110@xmath37 shell 
 ( a distance of @xmath4 5 lattice parameters ) the interactions fall to values small enough so as not to have any significant effect on the calculated lattice fourier transform of the exchange interaction and the curie temperature ( see below ) . 
 it is clear from fig.[fig10 ] that ferromagnetism in cras is robust and exists over a wide range of lattice parameters . 
 the distance dependence of the cr - cr exchange interactions in crsb is very similar to that in cras for both fm and dlm reference states . 
 for crs , crse , and crte the situation is somewhat different . for crs and crse , the fm reference states for some low lattice parameters 
 yield cr - cr interactions that are antiferromagnetic even at the nearest neighbor separation . for crte 
 , at the lowest lattice parameter studied ( 5.44  ) the nearest neighbor interaction for the fm reference state is ferromagnetic , but becomes antiferromagnetic with increasing lattice parameter , changing back to ferromagnetic at higher lattice parameters . 
 for all three compounds , the interactions are predominantly ferromagnetic at higher lattice parameters . 
 figs.[fig11 ] and [ fig12 ] show the distance dependence of the exchange interactions calculated for the fm reference states in crse and crte , respectively , for several lattice parameters . 
 predominant nearest neighbor antiferromagnetic interactions between the cr atoms result in negative values of the curie temperature , when calculated via eqs . 
 ( [ e2 ] ) or ( [ e3 ] ) . 
 these results for the curie temperature for the fm reference states can be discarded as being unphysical on two grounds : because of the neglect of the interactions involving the induced moments and also because they point to the possibility that the ground state is most probably antiferromagnetic or of complex magnetic structure . 
 the antiferromagnetic cr - cr interactions mostly disappear , when calculated for the dlm reference states . 
 this could be interpreted as being an indication that the actual magnetic structure of the ground states for these low lattice parameters in case of crs , crse and crte is closer to a dlm state than to an fm state . in fig.[fig13 ] we show the cr - cr exchange interactions for the dlm reference states in case of crse for the same lattice parameters as those considered for fig.[fig11 ] . 
 a comparison of the two figures shows that all interactions have moved towards becoming more ferromagnetic for the dlm reference states , the nearest neighbor interaction for the lowest lattice parameter staying marginally antiferromagnetic .     between the cr atoms in cras for various lattice parameters @xmath38 , calculated for the fm and dlm reference states . 
 the distance between the cr atoms is given in units of the lattice parameter @xmath38 ( the same applies to figs.[fig11]-[fig13 ] ) . 
 the main plot in fig.[fig10 ] shows the distance dependence up to 2.25@xmath38 , while the inset shows the values between 2.25@xmath38 and 5@xmath38 . 
 although the individual values of @xmath19 are small beyond about 2.25@xmath38 , their cumulative effects on the total exchange constant and the curie temerature can not be neglected ( see text for details ) . 
 comparison of the insets for the fm and dlm cases shows that the interactions are more damped for the dlm case , being at least an order of magnitude smaller for distances beyond @xmath42.25 - 2.5@xmath38 or 15 - 20 neighbor shells . 
 similar comments apply to the interactions presented in figs.[fig11]-[fig13].,width=379 ]    . 
 , width=336 ]    . , 
 width=336 ]    . , 
 width=336 ]      the deviation of the nature of the ground state from the reference state can be studied by examining the lattice fourier transform of the corresponding exchange interactions between the cr atoms : @xmath35 . as pointed out earlier , for the fm reference 
 states this procedure suffers from the drawback of neglecting the effects of all other interactions involving the induced moments . for the dlm reference states there are no induced moments , 
 so the relationship between the energy and @xmath36 is simpler , but a physical picture of the spin arrangement corresponding to a particular wave - vector @xmath39 is harder to visualize . for the fm reference states , if there were no moments other than those on the cr atoms , a maximum in @xmath36 at @xmath40 would imply that the ground state is ferromagnetic with collinear and parallel cr magnetic moments in all the unit cells . a maximum at symmetry points other than the @xmath41-point would imply the ground state being antiferromagnetic or a spin - spiral state . a maximum at a wave - vector @xmath39 that is not a symmetry point of 
 the bz would imply the ground state being an incommensurate spin spiral . 
 the presence of induced moments and the consequent interactions involving non - cr atoms and empty spheres spoil such interpretations based on @xmath36 derived from cr - cr interactions alone . 
 however , the tendencies they reveal might still be useful . 
 it is for this reason that we study the fourier transform @xmath36 , defined above , for both fm and dlm reference states .    in fig.[fig14 
 ] we have plotted this quantity for cras . 
 the results for crsb are quite similar . 
 the maximum in @xmath36 at the @xmath41-point for all lattice parameters and for both fm and dlm reference states can be taken as an indication that the ground state magnetic structure is ferromagnetic for cras for all the lattice parameters studied . 
 the same comment applies to crsb . 
 the apparent lack of smoothness in @xmath36 shown for the fm reference states is a consequence of the fact that there are other additional bands ( involving induced moments ) , which are supposed to cross the band shown , but have not been computed .                for crs , crse , and crte ( see figs.[fig15]-[fig16 ] ) , the deviation of the ground state for low lattice parameters from the parallel arrangement of cr moments is reflected in the result that the maximum moves away from the @xmath41-point for the fm reference states . at high values of the lattice parameter the maximum returns to the @xmath41-point . 
 the curves for crse are similar to those for crs and have therefore not been shown . 
 the fact that the maximum for the dlm reference sates lies at the @xmath41-point in most cases is again an indication that the ground state magnetic structure is closer to the dlm state than to the fm state . 
 the conclusions based on the fm reference state results in figs.[fig15 ] and[fig16 ] may be suspect on ground of neglecting the interactions involving the induced moments . 
 however , to explore whether they do carry any relevant information we have carried out additional calculations for the three compounds crs , crse and crte for two commonly occurring antiferromagnetic configurations : afm[001 ] , afm[111 ] . 
 note that another commonly occurring afm configuration afm[110 ] is not unique , i.e. there are several configurations that could be seen as an afm[110 ] arrangement ( see fig3 . of ref . 
 [ ] , table 2 of ref . 
 the simplest among these is actually equivalent to afm[100 ] . 
 the results for the total energy for the two afm calculations are shown in table [ table2 ] and compared with the corresponding fm and dlm total energies . 
 for crs , the lowest energy state for lattice parameters 5.44 and 5.55 @xmath6 is afm[111 ] , exactly as suggested by the maximum in @xmath36 appearing at the l - point in fig.[fig15 ] for the fm reference state and for these two lattice parameters . as the lattice parameter increases beyond 5.55  , 
 antiferromagnetic interactions diminish . for the next higher lattice parameter 5.66 @xmath6 in table [ table2 ] , 
 the lowest energy state is dlm . 
 this may suggest that the ground state has a complex magnetic structure , which remains to be explored . for higher lattice parameters the fm state has the lowest energy . for crse 
 , afm[111 ] state has the lowest energy up to the lattice parameter 5.66  , as is also supported by the maximum of @xmath36 at l - point . 
 the @xmath36 curves for crse are similar to those of crs , and have not been shown . 
 for crte , at the lowest lattice parameter of 5.44 @xmath6 the lowest energy state is fm , as is also indicated by the maximum of @xmath36 at the @xmath41-point . for higher lattice parameters 5.65 and 5.76 , 
 even though the @xmath36 curves point to the possibility of an afm[111 ] ground state , the fm state energy turns out to be the lowest among the configurations studied . 
 it could be concluded that in this case a proper relationship between the energy and @xmath36 , obtained without the neglect of the induced moments , would point to the ground state being fm . 
 for these three chalcogenides , for lattice parameters above 5.65 - 5.7 @xmath6the ground state should be fm .    [ 
 cols=""<,^,^,^,^,^,^ "" , ]      we determine the curie temperature using eqs . 
 ( [ e2 ] ) and ( [ e3 ] ) . for the dlm reference states , these produce estimates of @xmath1 from above the ferromagnetic@xmath42paramagnetic transition , and are free from errors due to induced moments 
 . however , these estimates are high compared with properly derived values of @xmath1 from below the transition . 
 the latter estimates would require the use of fm reference states ( where the ground states are known to be fm ) and thus a proper treatment of the induced moments . for cras and crsb 
 , the magnetic state is ferromagnetic for all the lattice parameters considered . 
 hence , for the sake of comparison we have calculated the @xmath1 for the fm reference states using eqs . 
 ( [ e2 ] ) and ( [ e3 ] ) as well . 
 according to the results of sandratskii @xcite the correctly calculated @xmath1 values , in the presence of interactions involving all the induced moments , would be higher . 
 thus , the correct estimates of @xmath1 should lie somewhere between the dlm results and the fm results obtained with the neglect of the induced moments . in fig . 
 [ fig17 ] we show these results for cras , crsb . 
 we have used up to 111 shells in the evaluation of eq . 
 ( [ e2 ] ) and for the lattice fourier transform of @xmath43 in eq . 
 ( [ e3 ] ) , after having tested the convergence with respect to the number of shells included . 
 the estimated computational error corresponding to the chosen number of shells used in these calculations is below @xmath44 . for comparison 
 we also include the results for the mixed alloy cras@xmath0sb@xmath0 , for which the calculated @xmath1 values fall , as expected , in between those of cras and crsb . 
 since rpa values are more accurate than mfa values , our best estimates of @xmath1 for cras range from somewhat higher than 500 k at low values of the lattice parameter , increasing to 1000 - 1100 k around the mid lattice parameter range ( 5.75 - 5.9  ) and then decreasing to around 600 k for higher lattice parameters ( 6.5 @xmath6 and above ) . for crsb 
 these estimates are consistently higher than those for cras : 1100 k , 1500 k and 1200 k , respectively . 
 the estimates for cras are similar to those provided by sasaiolglu @xcite    for crs , crse , the results obtained with the fm reference states would clearly be wrong , in particular , for the low values of the lattice parameters , for which we have shown the ground state to be antiferromagnetic within our limited search . 
 there is a possibility that the ground state for certain lattice parameters might have a complex magnetic structure . for crte 
 , even though the ground state appears to be ferromagnetic , there are considerable antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations , making the fm estimates unreliable . in fig . 
 [ fig18 ] we show the @xmath1 values for crs , crse and crte for the dlm reference states . 
 the values for lattice parameters for which the ground state has been shown to be antiferromagnetic in the preceding section should be discarded as being inapplicable . 
 similar results for the alloys cras@xmath0x@xmath0 ( x = s , se and te ) are shown in fig . 
 [ fig19 ] for dlm reference states . 
 for these , the ground state is ferromagnetic for all lattice parameters . 
 however , because of the neglect of the induced moments related effects , our results for the curie temperatures for the fm reference states are lower than the properly calculated values . 
 thus in fig.[fig19 ] we show the dlm results only , which are devoid of the induced moment effects and provide us with estimates of @xmath1 from above the transition . 
 these are expected to be somewhat higher than the properly computed values for fm reference states . 
 thus , for these alloys the trend revealed in fig . [ fig19 ] for the variation of @xmath1 with lattice parameter is correct . 
 the estimates themselves are qualitatively correct , albeit somewhat higher than the correct values . 
 only the rpa values are plotted in fig . 
 [ fig19 ] , which are more reliable than the mfa values . for comparison 
 , we also show the results for the pnictides cras , crsb , and cras@xmath0sb@xmath0 , which are isoelectronic among themselves , but have half an electron per unit cell less than the mixed alloys cras@xmath0x@xmath0 ( x = s , se and te )    sb@xmath0 are also shown . 
 , width=360 ]        x@xmath0 alloys with x = s , se and te . for comparison , 
 the results for cras , crsb and cras@xmath0sb@xmath0 are also shown . 
 all results shown are for dlm reference states , and as such , should be considered as upper limits for @xmath1 . , width=336 ]    the differences between the results for the pnictides , chalcogenides and the mixed pnictide - chalcogenides can be summarized as follows . 
 the pnictides , cras , crsb , and cras@xmath0sb@xmath0 , are strong ferromagnets at all the lattice parameters studied ( 5.44 - 6.62  ) . in the dlm description , 
 their @xmath1 stays more or less constant ( apart from a minor increase ) as the lattice parameter increases from 5.4 /aa to 6.1  , and then decreases beyond ( figs . 
 [ fig17 ] and [ fig19 ] . 
 the chalcogenides are antiferromagnetic or have complex magnetic structure for low lattice parameters . in the dlm description , their @xmath1 in the ferromagnetic state increases and then becomes more or less constant as the lattice parameter increases ( fig . 
 [ fig18 ] ) . 
 the mixed alloys cras@xmath0x@xmath0 ( x = s , se , te ) are ferromagnetic at all the lattice parameters studied . in the dlm description , their @xmath1 rises and then falls as the lattice parameter is increased from 5.44 to 6.62  . 
 a comparison of the results presented in figs . 
 [ fig17]-[fig19 ] shows that large changes in @xmath1 take place by changing the number of carriers . 
 changes due to isoelectronic doping are small compared with changes brought about by changing carrier concentration . 
 our _ ab initio _ studies of the electronic structure , magnetic moments , exchange interactions and curie temperatures in zb crx ( x = as , sb , s , se and te ) and cras@xmath0x@xmath0 ( x = sb , s , se and te ) reveal that half - metallicity in these alloys is maintained over a wide range of lattice parameters . the results for the exchange interaction and the curie temperature show that these alloys have relatively high curie temperatures , i.e. room temperature and above . 
 the exceptions occur for the alloys involving s , se and te at some low values of lattice parameters , where significant inter - atomic antiferromagnetic exchange interactions indicate ground states to be either antiferromagnetic or of complex magnetic nature . 
 a comparison of total energies for the fm , dlm , and two zb antiferromagnetic configurations ( afm[001 ] and afm[111 ] ) show the lowest energy configuration to be afm[111 ] for crs and crse for compressed lattice parameters ( table[table2 ] ) . 
 the possibility of afm ground states for compressed lattice parameters for crs was noted by zhao and zunger@xcite and for crse by sasioglu @xcite . 
 our search for the antiferromagnetic ground states is more thorough than what was reported in these two studies . 
 an extensive study of several antiferromagnetic configurations as well as ferrimagnetic and more complex magnetic structures for crs , crse and crte is currently underway . 
 the mixed pnictide - chalcogenide alloys cras@xmath0x@xmath0 ( x= s , se , te ) do not show any tendency to antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations for the entire range of the lattice parameter studied . 
 presumably the pnictogens suppress antiferromagnetic tendencies . 
 such alloys may play an important role in fabricating stable zb half - metallic materials , as the concentration of the pnictogens and the chalcogens may be varied to achieve lattice - matching with a given substrate . as long as the concentration of as or sb is higher than the chalcogen concentration 
 , half - metallic ferromagnetic state can be achieved . 
 there is a large variation in the curie temperature of these alloys ( fig . 
 [ fig19 ] ) as the lattice parameter varies from the low ( @xmath4 5.4  ) to the mid ( @xmath4 6.1  ) range of the lattice parameters studied . 
 this variation is much smaller for the isoelectronic alloys cras , crsb and cras@xmath0sb@xmath0 ( fig . 
 [ fig17 ] ) over this range of lattice parameters . 
 note that most ii - vi and iii - v zb semiconductors have lattice parameters in this range . 
 large changes in @xmath1 can be brought about by changing the carrier concentrations . 
 the pnictides in general have a higher @xmath1 than the chalcogenides . 
 our results for the curie temperature , the lattice fourier transform of the exchange interactions , and the resulting stability analysis are based on the exchange interactions between the cr atoms only . for 
 the fm reference states this causes some errors due to the neglect of the effects of the induced moments . 
 the dlm results are free from such errors . 
 it is expected that the present study will provide both qualitative and quantitative guidance to experimentalists in the field .

 the calculations are performed for zinc blende ( zb ) structure for 12 values of the lattice parameter between 5.44 and 6.62  , appropriate for some typical ii - vi and iii - v semiconducting substrates . 
 electronic structure is calculated via the linear muffin - tin - orbitals ( lmto ) method in the atomic sphere approximation ( asa ) , using empty spheres to optimize asa - related errors . whenever necessary 
 , the results have been verified using the full - potential version of the method , fp - lmto . 
 the disorder effect in the as - sublattice for cras@xmath0x@xmath0 ( x = sb , s , se , te ) alloys is taken into account via the coherent potential approximation ( cpa ) . 
 exchange interactions are calculated using the linear response method for the ferromagnetic ( fm ) reference states of the alloys , as well as the disordered local moments ( dlm ) states . 
 these results are then used to estimate the curie temperature from the low and high temperature side of the ferromagnetic / paramagnetic transition . 
 estimates of the curie temperature are provided , based on the mean field and the more accurate random phase approximations . 
 dominant antiferromagnetic exchange interactions for some low values of the lattice parameter for the fm reference states in crs , crse and crte prompted us to look for antiferromagnetic ( afm ) configurations for these systems with energies lower than the corresponding fm and dlm values . 
 results for a limited number of such afm calculations are discussed , identifying the afm[111 ] state as a likely candidate for the ground state for these cases .",arxiv
"cosmic rays are elementary particles arriving at the earth from outside that were discovered in the beginning of the 20th century as one of the main sources of natural radiation . 
 the cosmic ray spectrum has been observed as a continuum at all energies since their discovery . throughout this period cosmic rays 
 have always been the source of the highest energy elementary particles known to mankind , and for this reason they have given birth to particle physics . 
 the high energy tail of the spectrum as it is known today corresponds to energies up to 3  @xmath0ev and rates of a few particles per km@xmath1 per century . 
 it is remarkable that the cosmic rays have a quite featureless power law energy spectrum which decreases as approximately the cube of the primary energy . for energies above the few hundred tev the observed flux necessarily requires techniques that take advantage of the extensive air showers that the arriving particles develop as successive secondary particles cascade down into the atmosphere . 
 shower measurements allow the reconstruction of the arrival directions and the shower energy but the nature of the primary particle is extracted by a number of indirect methods . for energies above few tens of gev the detected particles , mainly protons , have arrival directions with a remarkably isotropic distribution . 
 this is understood in terms of diffusive propagation in the galactic magnetic fields . as the energy rises above a given value that depends on the charge of the particle , propagation in the galaxy should cease to be diffusive . 
 such high energy particles are expected to be extragalactic . 
 the observation of high energy cosmic rays has been recently reviewed by nagano and watson @xcite who have shown that there is very good agreement between different experiments including the low and high energy regions of the spectrum . 
 there is increasing evidence for a different component of the high energy end of the cosmic ray spectrum @xcite . combining data of five different experiments , agasa , akeno , haverah park , stereo fly s eye and yakutsk , nagano and watson 
 conclude that there is a clear signal of a change of the spectral slope in the region just above @xmath2ev @xcite . 
 composition studies have also given indications that there is a change to light element composition for energies above @xmath3ev @xcite although this conclusion is model dependent to some extent @xcite . 
 also the small anisotropy ( @xmath4 ) of @xmath2ev cosmic rays in the direction of the galactic anticenter detected with agasa disappears at higher energies @xcite . 
 the highest energy events detected present a serious challenge to theory and little is known about their origin . 
 if they are protons they should attenuate in the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) over distances of order 50  mpc . such attenuation was predicted to appear in the cosmic ray spectrum as a cutoff , the greisen - zatsepin - kuzmin ( gzk ) cutoff , just above 4  @xmath5gev @xcite . 
 if they are photons or iron nuclei it turns out that interactions with the radio and the infrared backgrounds are respectively responsible for attenuations over similar or even shorter distances . 
 no such features are seen in the observed cosmic ray spectrum . 
 if they are produced sufficiently close to us to avoid the cutoff then the arriving particles should be pointing to their sources . 
 this seems difficult to accommodate because there are very few known astrophysical sources capable of reaching the observed energies and on the other hand there is little evidence for the anisotropy that would result . 
 this article firstly discuses the problem presented by the high energy end of the cosmic ray spectrum with emphasis in the role of composition . 
 then it outlines new progress made in understanding different features of inclined showers illustrating how these showers can contribute to the composition issue reviewing the results obtained by a recent analysis of the inclined data in haverah park . 
 the discovery of events with energies above @xmath6  ev ( 100 eev ) dates back to the 1960 s , to the early days of air shower detection experiments @xcite . 
 since then they have been slowly but steadily detected by different experiments as illustrated in fig . 
 [ uptonow ] . 
 now there is little doubt about the non observation of a gzk cutoff , with over 17 published events above @xmath6  ev and five preliminary new events from hires @xcite . on the contrary the data suggests that the spectrum continues smoothly within the statistical errors , possibly with a change of slope . on the other hand 
 the data show no firm evidence of anisotropy but the significance of such studies is even more limited by the poor statistics . 
 both the details of the spectrum at the cutoff region and the extent to which the arrival directions of these particles cluster in the direction of their sources are very dependent on a number of unestablished issues . 
 these include the source distribution , the distance of the nearest sources , their emission spectra , the intervening magnetic fields and of course on the nature of the the cosmic rays themselves or composition . 
 if these particles are nuclei or photons the observational evidence is suggesting that these are coming from relatively nearby sources compared to the 50  mpc scale . 
 the conclusive power of observations is however strongly limited by both the poor statistics and a complex interrelation of hypotheses , but the situation is bound to change in the immediate future with a new generation of large aperture experiments , some like hires @xcite already in operation , others in construction @xcite and many others in planning @xcite . the complex puzzle that connects particle physics , magnetic fields , and cosmic rays 
 has attracted the attention of many fields in physics .    in a conventional approach these particles would be nuclei as the bulk of the cosmic ray spectrum which are accelerated through stochastic acceleration as suggested by fermi in 1949 . 
 this happens every time charged particles cross interfaces between regions that have astrophysical plasmas with different bulk motions , such as shock fronts . 
 transport is assumed to be diffusive in the plasma s magnetic field and on average in these processes a very small fraction of the bulk plasma kinetic energy is transferred as a boost to the individual particles , that typically end up with a power like spectrum . 
 acceleration of a particle of charge @xmath7 to an energy @xmath8 is strictly limited by dimensional arguments to objects that are sufficiently large or have sufficiently large magnetic fields . basically for a particle with momentum @xmath9 to be able to undergo such a boost , propagation must be diffusive , or equivalently the accelerator region @xmath10 must be larger than the larmor radius of the particle , @xmath11 , in its characteristic magnetic field @xmath12 : @xmath13 the requirement is well known by accelerator designers and is the ultimate reason for their high cost . 
 it turns out that few of the known astrophysical objects satisfy the minimum requirements to accelerate particles to @xmath0ev . 
 this is conveniently illustrated in a plot first conceived by michael hillas @xcite which is reproduced in fig . 
 [ hillasplot ] . 
 a number of possible scenarios are being discussed ; they imply acceleration in some objects including young pulsars , gamma ray bursts ( grb ) , our own galaxy , active galaxies and the local group of galaxies @xcite . 
 the power supply needed to keep the observed cosmic rays at the highest energies is consistent with the known power and distributions of these objects @xcite . 
 it is difficult to explain the observed flux spectrum in this conventional approach . a solution in which particles are accelerated nearby has difficulties because there are very few objects which are capable of accelerating particles to the maximum observed energies . 
 moreover many such objects are either too large or too distant for the cosmic ray spectrum detected at the earth not to show the predicted gzk cutoff . 
 if the sources were to be galactic no absorption cutoff would be expected but some spectral features are predicted for primary protons that are produced at a distance of more than a few mpc . on the other hand 
 the non observation of anisotropy complicates the puzzle , because the location of the possible accelerators in our vicinity is pretty well known . 
 primary protons having energies in the @xmath6  ev range are expected to be little deviated in the galactic magnetic fields . 
 our knowledge of extragalactic magnetic fields is poor but bounds on extragalactic magnetic fields also imply that the deviations of protons produced in the few mpc range are not large . 
 there are however possible configurations of the extragalactic magnetic fields that could explain many of the ultrahigh energy events as coming from a single source @xcite . 
 the issue is far from being resolved and knowledge about composition is bound to play a crucial role for future progress in understanding .    motivated by particle physics beyond the standard model , 
 many alternatives have been proposed that avoid acceleration and others that postulate different particles or different interactions . 
 these include annihilation of topological defects created in the early universe , heavy relics that survive from the primeval bath , non thermal particles that couple to gravity , or wimpzillas and annihilation of relic neutrinos with messenger neutrinos coming from remote places @xcite . 
 as regards composition two large categories of possible scenarios can be made namely those in which the observed particles are accelerated and those in which they are decay products of other particles . 
 these two classes differ greatly in composition . 
 a knowledge of composition is doubly important because firstly it may decide between these two classes of solutions and secondly because it would simplify the task of interpreting anisotropy measurements . 
 the models that depend on acceleration can reach higher energies if the accelerated particles have large charge @xmath14 . 
 this shows as a different restriction line in fig [ hillasplot ] . 
 the relative composition of different nuclei resulting from such a scenario will depend on the local abundances of the different nuclei and on the energy . depending on distance to the source and the surrounding environment 
 there may be energy losses , absorption and the production of secondary particle fluxes . 
 for instance in active galactic nuclei ( agn ) models the accelerated protons are expected to interact with ambient light or matter to produce pions that decay into photons and neutrinos . 
 the neutrinos can reach the earth unattenuated and provide a signature of proton acceleration . unless the environment becomes opaque to protons the relative fluxes of neutrinos and protons that reach 
 the earth should be a number of order one or smaller , just because neutrinos are secondaries with repect to protons . 
 the relative fluxes of photons and protons would be similar to neutrinos or smaller depending on the photon absorption both at the source and during transport to earth . 
 ratios of the same order of magnitude would apply to most acceleration models . 
 most of the non accelerating alternatives postulate the cosmic rays are products of the decay of other more massive particles produced by different mechanisms . typically these particles of mass of @xmath15ev ( often an @xmath16 particle ) decay into standard model particles which eventually fragment into hadrons , mostly pions and a small fraction of order @xmath17 of nucleons . while neutral pions decay into photons charged pions decay into neutrinos . 
 fragmentation processes , known form accelerator experiments and extrapolated to the high energies , become the common reference point for these mechanisms . 
 for this reason all these models share a very similar composition dominated by photons and neutrinos which typically are about ten times more numerous than nucleons at the production site .    depending on the source distribution the relative fluxes of these particles are modified through their interactions with the background radiation fields . 
 the neutrinos are the particles that preserve their production spectrum without being attenuated . 
 protons get attenuated in few tens of mpc in the cosmic microwave background , ( the gzk cutoff ) , while photons are attenuated already in few mps mainly through pair production in the radio background . as a result 
 the ratio of neutrinos to protons can in principle become higher at the earth than when they are produced if the sources are quite distant or cosmologically distributed . 
 many of the proposed mechanisms are expected to cluster in our galactic halo . 
 this possibility is receiving a lot of attention because it would provide a relatively natural explanation for the absence of the gzk cutoff . in that case 
 however the sources will be quite near and the ratio of photons to nucleons should be expected to be of order 10 , close to its value at production . 
 other sources are not expected to cluster and hence the photon to nucleon ratio is expected to drop to values close to one . 
 the ratio of photons to nucleons depends on the source distribution and is rather sensitive to clustering . 
 most air shower detectors in existence consist on arrays of particle detectors that sample the extensive air shower front as it reaches the ground . 
 multiple particle production takes place in the successive high energy interactions produced as the shower penetrates the medium . as a result 
 the number of particles in the shower front increases exponentially . 
 when the average particle energy in the front becomes too low for multiple particle production the shower reaches it maximum number of particles . 
 the development of these showers is typically governed by the radiation length in the material which is of order 36  g  @xmath18 in air and shower maximum , which is only logarithmically dependent on the primary particle energy , occurs at a couple of thousand meters for vertical showers of energies of order @xmath6  ev . 
 vertical showers are close to shower maximum when reaching the earth s surface , have pretty good circular symmetry and are less affected by the earth s magnetic field . 
 it is thus not surprising that air showers have traditionally been studied at close to vertical incidence , typically for zenith angles below @xmath19 , in summary because it is much simpler . 
 moreover in most extensive air shower arrays the particle detectors are oriented to have maximum collection area for vertical incidence . 
 since these detectors are often scintillator sheets , they tend to become very inefficient for very inclined showers . 
 as the zenith angle increases the traversed atmospheric depth rises from 1000 to close to 36000 g  @xmath18 . as a result 
 the shower maximum is reached in the upper layers of the atmosphere and most of the shower is absorbed before reaching the ground . 
 it has been known for a long time that weakly interacting particles such as neutrinos can induce close to horizontal air showers deep in the atmosphere with particle distributions that are quite similar to vertical showers @xcite . 
 air shower array detectors looking in the close to horizontal direction can thus be sensitive to high energy neutrino fluxes @xcite . 
 in fact most bounds on neutrino fluxes have already been obtained from air shower experiments @xcite . 
 the original motivation of studying inclined showers was to understand the cosmic ray background to the neutrino induced showers . 
 although the electromagnetic part of the air shower induced by an inclined cosmic ray is indeed absorbed before reaching ground level , the shower front however also contains muons which are mainly produced by charge pion decay when the primary particle is a hadron . 
 these muons do travel practically unattenuated all the slant atmospheric depth and produce density patterns on the ground that are much affected by the earth s magnetic field . 
 it has recently become quite clear that such inclined showers can be analysed . 
 this not only nearly doubles the aperture of any air shower array but , when combined with vertical measurements , it has a remarkable potential for the study of primary composition @xcite . 
 much development in this field has been possible by the modelling of the muon density patterns produced by inclined showers under the influence of the earth s magnetic field @xcite . 
 the lateral distributions of muons in inclined showers can be understood in terms of a simple model @xcite in which the magnetic field is firstly neglected . 
 the model stresses two important facts that have been extensively checked with simulations in the absence of a magnetic field @xcite : most of the muons in an inclined shower are produced in a well defined region of shower development which is quite distant from the ground and the lateral deviation of a muon is inversely correlated with its energy . 
 indeed most of the fundamental properties of these inclined showers are governed by the distance and depth travelled by the muons . 
 it is remarkable that the average slant distance travelled by the muons is of order 4 km for vertical showers , becomes 16 km at 60@xmath20 and continues to rise as the zenith angle rises to reach 300 km for a completely horizontal shower . 
 this distance plays a crucial role as a low energy smooth cutoff for the muon energy distribution . for 
 inclined showers the muons must have much more energy at production to reach ground level without decaying than in the vertical case . both the travel time and the muon energy loss become relevant . 
 the model simply assumes that all muons are produced at a given altitude @xmath21 with a fixed transverse momentum @xmath22 that is uniquely responsible for the muon deviation from shower axis . in the transverse plane to the shower at ground level the muon deviation , @xmath23 , 
 is inversely related to muon momentum @xmath9 . 
 the density pattern has full circular symmetry when there is no magnetic field . 
 when the magnetic field effects are considered the muons deviate a further distance @xmath24 in the perpendicular direction to the magnetic field projected onto the transverse plane @xmath25 , given by : @xmath26 where in the last equation @xmath27 is to be expressed in tesla , @xmath21 in m and @xmath28 in gev . 
 as the muon deviations are small compared to @xmath21 they can be added as vectors in the transverse plane and the muon density pattern is a relatively simple transform of the circularly symmetry pattern . 
 the muon patterns in the transverse plane can be projected onto the ground plane to compare with data as well as standard simulation programs . 
 eq .  [ alpha ] is telling us that all positive ( negative ) muons that in the absence of a magnetic field would fall in a circle of radius @xmath23 around shower axis , are translated a distance @xmath24 to the right ( left ) of the @xmath29 direction . 
 the dimensionless parameter @xmath30 measures the relative effect of the translation . for small zenith angles @xmath21 is relatively small and @xmath31 so that the magnetic effects are also small , and results into slight elliptical shape of the isodensity curves .    for high zeniths however @xmath32 the magnetic translation exceeds the deviation the muons have due to their @xmath28 . 
 in this case _ shadow _ regions with no muons are expected in the muon density profiles . for an approximate @xmath33  mev and @xmath34 t 
 this happens when @xmath21 exceeds a distance of order 30  km , that is for zeniths above @xmath35 . 
 these shadow regions in the transverse plane are indeed an outstanding feature of the ground density profiles at high zeniths as seen in the simulations 
 .    the simple model can be actually generalized to account for muon energy distributions as a function of distance to shower axis , and improved using the correlation between the average muon energy and the distance to shower axis as obtained in dedicated simulations . 
 when all this is done the obtained muon density patterns are shown to be accurately reflect those obtained with simulations and this proves to be a very useful tool for the study of inclined showers . 
 for each zenith angle the primary particle energy sets the normalization of the particle densities . 
 for proton primaries the total number of muons in the shower scales with the proton energy @xmath8 as : @xmath36 where @xmath37 is a constant . 
 it is remarkable that the shape of the lateral distribution of the muons does not significantly change for showers of energy spanning over three orders of magnitude . 
 the same happens for heavier nuclei with slightly different parameters . 
 the results are slightly model dependent . 
 two alternative hadronic interaction models have been compared , the quark gluon string model ( qgsm ) and sibyll to give also the same behaviour with also different parameters . 
 table  [ nmu.tab ] illustrates these effects . 
 .relationship between muon number and primary energy for proton and irons in two hadronic models ( see equation  [ escaling ] ) . [ cols=""<,>,^,^"",options=""header "" , ]     as a final result the muon distributions can be represented by continuous functions which are analytically obtained once we know the main features of a shower in the absence of magnetic field . in practice 
 this implies that only different zenith angles have to be simulated . 
 different azimuths are obtained by adequate transformations of the showers without magnetic deflections . 
 the algorithm is fast and allows detector simulation and also event by event reconstruction of data obtained by air shower experiments . 
 this powerful technique has been used to analyse the inclined shower data obtained in the haverah park array . 
 the haverah park detector was a 12  km@xmath1 air shower array using 1.2  m deep water erenkov tanks that was running from 1974 until 1987 in northern england which has been described elsewhere @xcite . 
 it is possibly the most appropriate detector for this study because the water erenkov tanks have a uniquely large cross section to sample shower fronts of horizontal air showers . 
 moreover the erenkov technique gives larger signals for muons than for electrons simply because the muons have typically larger energies and travel through the whole detector . 
 a careful study has been made of the energy deposition of signal in water erenkov tanks by horizontal muons using conventional simulation programs for this purpose @xcite . 
 a number of effects have to be considered to interpret the observed data . 
 inclined particles can produce light that falls directly into the phototubes without being reflected in the tank walls . 
 horizontal muons produce more signal through delta rays because on average they have higher energies than in vertical showers . 
 there is a significant signal deposited by electromagnetic particles that arise mainly through muon decay . 
 finally the higher energy muons are more likely to deposit more energy in the tanks because of catastrophic energy losses 
 . the event rate as a function of zenith angle has been simulated with careful treatment of all these effects using the muon distributions obtained as described in the previous section . 
 the qualitative behaviour of the registered rate is well described in the simulation and the normalization is also shown to agree with data to better than @xmath38 using the measured cosmic ray spectrum for vertical incidence , assuming proton primaries and using the qgsm model @xcite .    more impressive 
 are the results of fits of the models for muon densities to the observed particle densities sampled by the different detectors on an event by event basis . 
 the nearly 10,000 events recorded with zenith angles above @xmath39 have been analysed for arrival directions , impact point and primary energy in the assumption the primaries are protons . a complex sequence of arrival direction and density fits 
 is performed to minimize the effect of correlations between energy and arrival directions . 
 the analysed date is subject to a set of quality cuts : the shower is contained in the detector ( distance to core less than 2  km ) , the @xmath40 probability of the event is greater than @xmath41 and the downward error in the reconstructed energy is less than @xmath42 . 
 these cuts ensure that the events are correctly reconstructed and exclude all events detected above @xmath43 . 
 examples of reconstructed events compared to predictions are illustrated in fig . 
 [ events.fig ] . 
 two new events with energy exceeding @xmath6  ev have been revealed . 
 the results have been compared to a simulation that reproduces the same fitting procedure and cuts using the cosmic ray spectrum deduced from vertical air shower measurements in reference @xcite . 
 the agreement between the integral rate above @xmath44  ev measured and that obtained with simulation is striking when the qgsjet model is used . 
 sibyll leads to a slight underestimate @xcite . 
 the universality of the muon lateral distribution function is very powerful and once the equivalent proton energy is determined for all events , the corresponding energies in the assumption that the primaries are iron nuclei ( photons ) can be obtained multiplying the proton energy by a factor which is @xmath45 ( 6 ) for @xmath44  ev . as a result 
 when a photon primary spectrum is assumed the simulated rate seriously underestimates the observed data by a factor between 10 and 20 . 
 a fairly robust bound on the photon composition at ultra high energies can be established assuming a two component proton photon scenario . 
 the photon component of the integral spectrum above @xmath46ev ( 4  @xmath44  ev ) must be less than @xmath47 ( @xmath48 ) at the @xmath49 confidence level . 
 details of the analysis are presented in @xcite . 
 the results of this method when applied to a first analysis of inclined showers produced by cosmic rays above @xmath46ev demonstrates that the study of inclined showers not only can double the acceptance of air shower arrays but it can be a very useful tool for the study of photon composition

"cold atoms in optical lattices is the application of two formerly distinct aspects of physics : quantum gases from atomic physics @xcite and laser theory from quantum optics @xcite . 
 the optical lattices are artificial crystals of light , that is , a periodic intensity pattern formed by interference of two or more laser beams . as an insight , a pair of these laser beams in opposite directions ( that is , two orthogonal standing waves with orthogonal polarization ) will give a one - dimensional ( 1d ) lattice , two pairs in two opposite directions can be used to create a 2d lattice and a similar three pairs in opposite directions will give a 3d lattice . 
 atoms can be cooled and trapped in these optical lattices . 
 thus in simple form , an optical lattice looks effectively like an egg carton where the atoms , like eggs , can be be arranged one per well to form a crystal of quantum matter @xcite . though the cold atoms in optical lattices was initially used to investigate quantum behaviour such as bloch oscillations , wannier - stark ladders and tunneling phenomena usually associated with crystals in a crystalline solid @xcite , it is the theoretical proposal @xcite and consequent experimental realization @xcite of the superfluid to mott insulator ( sf - mi ) transition which is an important phenomenon in condensed matter physics that has given rise to the possibility of using it as a test laboratory for phenomena in condensed matter physics . 
 the success of the sf - mi transition in turn emanates from the laboratory observation of bose einstein condensation ( bec ) . 
 the history of bec began in 1924 when satyendra nath bose first gave the rules governing the behaviour of photon which is the commonest boson . 
 excited by this work , einstein in the same year extended the rules to other bosons and thereby gave birth to the bose - einstein distribution ( bed ) @xcite . while doing this , einstein found that not only is it possible for two bosons to share the same quantum state at the same time , but that they actually prefer doing so . 
 he therefore predicted that when the temperature goes down , almost all the particles in a bosonic system would congregate in the ground state even at a finite temperature . 
 it is this physical state that is called bose - einstein condensation . 
 thus it has always been considered a consequence of quantum effects from statistical mechanics in many textbooks as the phase transition is achieved without interactions @xcite . 
 the einstein s prediction , however , was considered a mathematical artifact for sometime until fritz london in 1938 while investigating superfluid liquid helium , realized that the phase transition could be accounted for in terms of bec . 
 this analysis , however , suffered a major set back because the helium atoms in the liquid interacted quite strongly . 
 this was why scientists had to move ahead in search of bec in less complicated systems that would be close to the free boson gas model . 
 fortunately , the breakthrough came in 1995 when the first bec was observed in rubidium atoms and this was followed by similar observations in some other cold alkali atoms such as those of lithium and sodium ( see more details in ref . 
 ( @xcite and a guideline to the literature of bec in dilute gases in ref . 
 as stated above , the observation of bec led to the observation of ( sf - mi ) transition and thereby open the possibility to investigate various phenomena in condensed matter physics by mimicking them with ultracold atoms in optical lattices . 
 this possibility has led to a deluge of studies ( see @xcite for a recent review ) as it brings together atomic physicists , quantum opticians and condensed matter physicists . 
 one draw back is that even when there have been theoretical papers investigating these phenomena with fermionic cold atoms @xcite , cold bosons are used in the actual experiments @xcite for testing spin ordering . 
 this has been overcome by the recent observation of the mi with fermonic atoms @xcite . 
 it follows then that the possibility to use cold atoms in optical lattices as a test laboratory for condensed matter physics is no longer a speculative physics . 
 rather , it has become an aspect of physics with its own methods and approaches . 
 therefore , it has reach a stage when it should start having some introductory impact on our curriculum , possibly as applications of optics , atomic physics and simulation of spin ordering hamiltonians @xcite in condensed matter physics . the purpose of this current study is to present a pedagogical study of investigating spin ordering in an isolated double - well - type potential ( simply double well ( dw ) ) which can be adopted for instructional purposes . 
 for the dw is one of the simplest experimental set ups of optical lattices to study spin hamiltonians @xcite . 
 this is because the system can be completely controlled and measured in an arbitrary two - spin basis by dynamically changing the lattice parameters @xcite . on the theoretical side , 
 the dw can be considered as two localized spatial modes separated by a barrier and consequently be investigated as a two - mode approximation @xcite . 
 the dw is a 1d optical lattice in which the transverse directions are in strong confinement and thus the motions of an atom in these directions are frozen out . to create the dw , we start with a standing wave of period @xmath0 ( long lattice ) so that the potential seen by the atoms trapped in it is @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the lattice depth , which is a key parameter for a special lattice potential . 
 + next we superpose a second standing wave with period @xmath3 and depth @xmath4 ( short lattice ) on the first one as in fig . 
 this will lead to a symmetric double - well superlattice ( fig 1c ) with a total optical lattice @xcite @xmath5.\ ] ] the configuration and varying of the parameter space ( i.e. various parameters ) of a hamiltonian to be tested in this superlattice is achieved by manipulating and controlling the depths of the short and long lattices . 
 for example , by increasing the lattice depth of long - lattice @xmath2 , we could reach from superfluid to mott - insulator regime , which is convenient for studying the few particles phenomena in a local double - well cell . and the barrier height of the double - well is controlled by the lattice depth of short - lattice , @xmath4 . the effective double - well 
 is reached if @xmath6 . 
 otherwise the minimal points of the optical lattice are the bottom of the long - lattice . 
 this could be seen clearly from eq . 
 ( [ topotential ] ) after we expand the @xmath7 term , @xmath8 ^ 2+\frac{v_1}{4}\left(2-\frac{v_1}{4v_2}\right),\ ] ] so that @xmath9 results in @xmath10 , that is , the minimum is one of the long - lattice with a lift of @xmath4 . on the other hand , 
 if @xmath11 , an effective double - well is created . the minimum can be found at @xmath12/2 $ ] . making a power series expansion around the potential minimum 
 , then a single atom of mass @xmath13 trapped initially in any of the well will freely tunneling back and forth with the oscillation frequency of @xmath14 thus the frequency depends on not only the lattice depths @xmath2 and @xmath4 , but also on the lattice spacing @xmath0 . 
 usually , the small lattice spacing @xmath0 is preferred as it leads to a large frequency though this could also be restricted by changing the ratio @xmath15 
 . this preference also lead to the use of the recoil energy of the short lattice as the unit of the depths of the optical lattice @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the wave length of the short lattice . 
 + for example , in the experiment @xcite , the depth of the long lattice is @xmath18 while the depth of the short lattice is about @xmath19 . 
 this gives the oscillation frequency in a range @xmath20 for @xmath21rb and @xmath22 , we can get @xmath23 , which gives @xmath24 . lets define the harmonic oscillator length @xmath25 , 
 then we can readily get @xmath26 . comparing to the period of short lattice @xmath27 
 , it implies the ground state wave function is rather localized , which ensures the validity of the two - mode approximation . 
 + finally , it is pertinent to describe how to create an asymmetric dw ( fig 1d ) . 
 the potential bias or the tilt @xmath28 of the double - well is introduced by changing the relative phase of the two potentials ( i.e. short and long lattices ) and this can be realized by applying a magnetic field gradient of @xmath29 @xcite . 
 consequently , tuning @xmath30 gives the potential difference between the two potential minima of the dw . 
 we can realize the adiabatic and diabatic operations on the tilt of the dw by controlling the increasing speed of @xmath30 @xcite . 
 and @xmath3 resulting in ( b ) a chain of double wells from which we can study ( c ) an isolated symmetric double well or ( d ) asymmetric double well ]    . 
 [ double well ] 
 within the above consideration and assuming atoms confined in an isolated dw , we reach the two - mode approximation represented as a two - site version of the hubbard model @xcite @xmath31+u(n_{\uparrow l}n_{\downarrow l}+n_{\uparrow r}n_{\downarrow r } ) \label{h1}\ ] ] where @xmath32 is the creation operator ( annihilation operator ) for an atom with spin @xmath33 , @xmath34 is the corresponding number operator , @xmath35 ( both j and t are used in the literature though the cold matter community seems to prefer j ) describes the tunneling rate between the two wells , @xmath28 is the potential bias for the double - well and @xmath36 is the two - body interaction when two atoms occupy the same site . 
 + basically , the hubbard model is a single band lattice model supporting a single atomic state which can hold up to two particles . 
 if we consider that these particles have two internal spins , @xmath37 , then the hamiltonian will consist of the superposition of six fock basis states @xcite denoted by @xmath38 and @xmath39 , with a basis state @xmath40 denoting the @xmath41 and @xmath42 wells . 
 the use of the superposition principle which is a fundamental concept in quantum theory @xcite is consistent with both the model hamiltonian and experiment in which the time evolution of the initial states produces coherent superposition of states . 
 thus the wavefunction of the system will be the superposition of all possible states @xmath43 where for convenience , @xmath44 , @xmath45 and @xmath46 , with i , j denoting the sites while @xmath47 and @xmath48 denote singlet and triplet states respectively . from basic physics 
 , the orientation of the two spins in a state can either be singlet @xmath47 if @xmath49 or triplet @xmath48 if @xmath50 @xcite .      by tuning the potential bias @xmath51 
 , we can obtain all the eigenenergies and corresponding eigenstates analytically . 
 this is achieved by directly diagonalizing the hamiltonian in eq . 
 ( [ h1 ] ) to obtain eigenenergies and eigenstates as shown in table ( [ tabeigen1 ] ) . in the weak interacting case , @xmath52 , the state @xmath53 and state @xmath54 have lower 
 energy so that the doubly occupied singlet state , @xmath55 will be the ground state of the system . 
 this can be considered as the signature for a superfluid state for bosonic atom in a double well . however , the strong interaction regime is more interesting to study for spin ordering . in this regime , @xmath56 , 
 the ground state will be singly occupied as the large atomic repulsion energetically suppress the double occupancy . 
 here it is the @xmath57 that are occupied while the @xmath58 are unpopulated @xcite . 
 the populated @xmath47 and @xmath48 of @xmath57 are nearly degenerate because the energy difference between them is about @xmath59 , which is a small quantity . 
 however , when @xmath60 , the ground state approaches @xmath47 while the first excited state is @xmath48 . 
 if we prepare the initial state as antiferromagnetic , @xmath61 , the dynamical evolution involves two frequencies @xcite @xmath62 from the above frequencies , one could get the tunneling rate @xmath63 and the interaction strength @xmath64 respectively . 
 these two frequencies can be obtained from exerimental data and then used to test the validity of the simple two - mode model . 
 this has been done for bosonic atoms in experiment @xcite . 
 the extension to fermionic atoms may be different but the eigenenergies and corresponding eigenstates are the same , which means we can get similar dynamics as long as the interaction between atoms satisfy @xmath65 @xcite . on the other hand , the interaction of fermion could be also attractive generally . 
 it is interesting to identify the ground state in this situation . 
 table ( [ tabeigen1 ] ) works here too . 
 .eigenstates and eigenenergies of hamiltonian ( [ h1 ] ) [ cols=""^,^,^,^,^,^,^"",options=""header "" , ]     [ tabeigen1 ]    when @xmath66 , the ground state does not change too much at weak tunneling . 
 however , the first excited state is not the triplet state @xmath67 anymore but the state @xmath68 . 
 it is interesting that the energy difference is the same @xmath69 although the interaction is attractive and the first excited state is changed . 
 this analysis shows that @xmath68 could be involved in the dynamics if we start from the antiferromagnetic initial state @xmath70 . 
 the two frequencies that can be observed in experiment are @xmath71 here the two - body interaction strength directly relates to @xmath72 , which can be extracted from the measured experimental data . 
 the results show that ultracold atoms trapped in the superlattice not only could be used to simulate the phenomena in condensed matter physics , but also offer the possibility to compare the results with theoretical calculation of model hamiltonians .

 right , attractive interaction @xmath76 . , title=""fig : "" ]    one of the advantages of the trapped ultracold atoms is that they can be controlled precisely and easily . by tuning the two optical lattices 
 , we can change the bias of the double - well superlattice . 
 the ground state of the two fermions are trapped in the same site in the large potential bias . by slowly reducing the bias , 
 the ground state is followed adiabatically to the singlet state . in this way 
 , we can prepare the initial states either in the state @xmath53 or @xmath54 . 
 so it is interesting to investigate how the bias influences the states .    when the potential bias @xmath28 is included , the eigenstates and the eigenenergies have complicated expressions 
 . three of the eigenenergies are @xmath77 always . 
 the others are the roots of the algebra equation @xmath78    we numerically solve the equation and plot the eigen spectra in fig . 
 ( [ spectra ] ) . when @xmath79 , the ground state energy is negative and modified by the presence of potential bias . 
 when @xmath28 is not too big , the ground state energy is close to the one without potential bias . also , the energy difference between the ground state and first excited state is small . at large potential bias @xmath80 
 , however , the approximate ground state energy reads @xmath81 the two atoms are in the right well and the ground state reaches @xmath54 . on the contrary , 
 the system is degenerate further in the weak interaction regime @xmath82 . 
 if the interaction is attractive , the energy spectra is reversed . 
 the energy difference between the ground state and the first excited state is bigger except at @xmath51 , i.e. an anti - crossing appears . 
 this is shown obviously in fig . 
 ( [ spectra ] ) . 
 the observation from this analysis is that the potential bias can be used to control the energy difference between the singlet and triplet states @xcite . 
 this is why an attempt was made in @xcite to use it to drive eq . 
 [ h1 ] into superexchange interaction observed experimentally . 
 the outcome , however , is that inter - well interactions have to be included to eq . 
 [ h1 ] to get close to the experimental data . 
 thus in the next section , we will consider such an extension . 
 it is obvious from the preceding section that a hamiltonian to study spin ordering in the cold atoms in optical lattices needs to contain long range interactions . 
 it is important to point out that the overlapping of different electronic orbitals gives rise to the interaction between spins in condensed matter but this overlapping is very small in optical lattices @xcite . 
 however , the possibility of the atoms to tunnel through the barrier in quantum mechanics enables the inter - site interactions @xcite . 
 two natural candidates are the inter - site coulombic interaction @xmath83 and exchange interaction @xmath84 . 
 interestingly , the inclusion of these interactions as means of going beyond the standard hubbard hamiltonian to account for ferromagnetism in metals have been proposed @xcite . 
 furthermore , we do not need a potential bias since the spin ordering is induced by these interactions . within these considerations , the extended form of eq . 
 [ h1 ] with @xmath85 is @xmath86 . 
 \label{h2}\ ] ] it is then easy to obtain the ground state energy and wavefunction using the highly simplified correlated variational approach ( hscva ) in @xcite . 
 the beauty of this pedagogical approach is that the ground state energy clearly depicts the physics of the model as one vary the parameter space as in experiments with optical lattices . 
 interestingly , the method allows the decoupling of the kinetic part from the interaction parts so that we can observe the effects of including each of them to the kinetic part . 
 thus the combination of these two factors makes the hscva very suitable to investigate the spin hamiltonian to be tested using cold atoms in optical lattices . + we start with the variational ground state energy @xmath87 where the h is the model hamiltonian and the ket in the hilbert space is the trial wave function ( cf . 
 ( [ wavefunction1 ] ) ) defined as + @xmath88 the x and y in eq . 
 ( [ wavefunction2 ] ) are the variational parameters . 
 it is straightforward to show @xcite that eq . 
 ( [ variational ] ) leads to a 3 x 3 blocked matrix of 2 x 2 and 1 x 1 resulting in the lowest state energies @xcite , @xmath89 for the singlet states @xmath55 or @xmath90 depending on u , @xmath91\ ] ] and @xmath92 for the triplet state @xmath93 , @xmath94 the smallest of these two energies will be the ground state energy of the system . 
 the corresponding eigenvectors are then substituted as the variational parameters in eq . 
 ( [ wavefunction2 ] ) to give the corresponding ground state wavefunctions . 
 thus when @xmath95 , the system will be antiferromagnetic while it will be ferromagnetic otherwise . taking into account this condition and eqs . 
 ( [ singlete ] ) and ( [ triplete ] ) , the critical value of @xmath84 at which there is transition from one state to another is + @xmath96.\ ] ] now to test this hamiltonian in a double well , we need to know how the atomic positions and spin orientations varies with the parameter space . for example , as demonstrated in subsection ( a ) , the ground state of the system will be a mott insulator when the u is very strong . 
 this generally accepted property of the half - filled standard hubbard hamiltonian ( i.e. @xmath97 ) is already achieved with ultracold fermionic atoms @xcite . 
 one of the signatures of the mi state is the decrease in doubly occupied states in the ground state as @xmath36 is increased . 
 this is demonstrated in fig . 
 3 showing the level of occupation of the states denoted by the variational parameters of the ground state wavefunction with increase in @xmath36 . 
 the inclusion of @xmath83 , however , enhances the double occupancy and is therefore expected to suppress the observation of the mi especially for low values of u. it follows then that when we switch on the @xmath84 , the @xmath36 is likely to drive the system into more singly occupied states and thereby enhancing the transition to a ferromagnetic state while the @xmath83 will suppress it . 
 this is demonstrated in eqs . 
 ( [ singlete ] ) - ( [ criticalj ] ) and then depicted in fig . 
 4 showing the variation of the antiferromagnetic - ferromagnetic transition critical point of @xmath84 with @xmath36 at various values of @xmath83 . + the above theoretical @xmath83 and @xmath84 
 can also be compared with the ones obtained from extracted data from the experiments as was done for j and u in the standard hubbard hamiltonian . 
 this is by expressing the possible dynamic evolution frequencies from for the singlet states and triplet states as @xmath98\ ] ] @xmath99 we see immediately that we can recover eq . 
 ( [ frequency ] ) from eq . 
 ( [ freqsinglete ] ) when @xmath97 . taking into account eqs . 
 ( [ frequency ] ) , ( [ freqsinglete ] and ( [ freqtriplete ] ) , we can then estimate @xmath100 $ ] and @xmath101 $ ] . thus we can also obtain the inter - site interaction parameters from the data extracted from the experiments . 
 the increasing advancement on how to prepare , manipulate and detect phenomena in condensed matter physics using cold atoms in optical lattices has reached a stage when it can be used as instructional means . 
 the fact that laser cooling and trapping are now widely used in atomic physics laboratory @xcite means the realization of the double wells experiment can also be achieved . 
 the first investigation is to mimic the mott insulator state . by extracting @xmath102 and @xmath103 from the experiment , the experimental values of j and u 
 can be compared with the ones from their theoretical values . 
 the experiment can then be advanced to determine @xmath83 and @xmath84 and then compare them with their theoretical values as depicted in fig . 
 interestingly , the model hamiltonian studied here has been proposed to account for spin ordering in transition metals . 
 it is hoped therefore , that the testing of this extended hubbard model can easily be compared to available data for the transition metals @xcite after some refining of the approach here . 
 this will also include extending the study to dynamic properties of the model .     while there is increase in inter - site states @xmath104 as the on - site coulomb interactions u increases . ]     with the on - site coulomb interactions @xmath36 at various values of the inter - site coulomb interactions @xmath83 .

"recall a polynomial @xmath0 is _ postcritically finite _ if the forward orbits of its critical points are finite . 
 then the filled julia set of @xmath1 contains a forward invariant , finite topological tree , called the _ hubbard tree _ @xcite . 
 the _ core entropy _ of @xmath1 is the topological entropy of the restriction of @xmath1 to its hubbard tree . 
 we shall restrict ourselves to quadratic polynomials . 
 given @xmath2 , the external ray at angle @xmath3 determines a postcritically finite parameter @xmath4 in the mandelbrot set @xcite . 
 we define @xmath5 to be the core entropy of @xmath6 . 
 the main goal of this paper is to prove the following result :    [ t : main ] the core entropy function @xmath7 extends to a continuous function from @xmath8 to @xmath9 . 
 the theorem answers a question of w. thurston , who first introduced and explored the core entropy of polynomials . 
 as thurston showed , the core entropy function can be defined purely combinatorially , but it displays a rich fractal structure ( figure [ f : core ] ) , which reflects the underlying geometry of the mandelbrot set . 
 [ f : core ]    the concept of core entropy generalizes to complex polynomials the entropy theory of real quadratic maps , whose monotonicity and continuity go back to milnor and thurston @xcite : indeed , the invariant real segment is replaced by the invariant tree , which captures all the essential dynamics . 
 on the topological side , hubbard trees have been introduced to classify postcritically finite maps @xcite , @xcite , and their entropy provides a new tool to study the parameter space of polynomials : for instance , the restriction of @xmath5 to non - real veins of the mandelbrot set is also monotone @xcite , which implies that the lamination for the mandelbrot set can be reconstructed by looking at level sets of @xmath10 . note by comparison that the entropy of @xmath11 on its julia set is constant , independent of @xmath3 , hence it does not give information on the parameter . 
 furthermore , the value @xmath5 equals , up to a constant factor , the hausdorff dimension of the set of biaccessible angles for @xmath11 ( @xcite , @xcite ) . for dendritic julia sets , the core entropy also equals the asymptotic stretch factor of @xmath11 as a rational map @xcite . 
 a rational external angle @xmath3 determines a postcritically finite map @xmath11 , which has a finite hubbard tree @xmath12 . 
 the simplest way to compute its entropy is to compute the markov transition matrix for the map @xmath11 acting on @xmath12 , and take ( the logarithm of ) its leading eigenvalue : however , this requires to know the topology of @xmath12 , which changes wildly after small perturbations of @xmath3 .    in this paper , we shall by - pass this issue by leveraging an algorithm , devised by thurston , which considers instead a larger matrix , whose entries are _ pairs _ of postcritical angles ( see section [ s : algo ] ) ; no knowledge of the topology of the hubbard tree is required . in order to prove @xmath10 is continuous , we develop an infinite version of such algorithm , which is defined for _ any _ angle @xmath13 . 
 in particular , instead of taking the leading eigenvalue of a transition matrix , we shall encode the possible transitions in a directed graph , which will now have countably many vertices . by taking the _ spectral determinant _ of such graph ( see section [ s : spectral ] for a definition ) , for each angle @xmath13 , we construct a power series @xmath14 which converges in the unit disk and such that its  smallest zero "" @xmath15 is related to the core entropy by @xmath16 we then produce an algorithm to compute each coefficient of the taylor expansion of @xmath14 , and show that essentially these coefficients vary continuously with @xmath3 : the result follows by rouch s theorem .    as a corollary of our method 
 , we shall prove that the entropy function is actually hlder continuous at angles @xmath3 such that @xmath17 ( using renormalization , it can be proven that @xmath10 is not hlder continuous where @xmath18 ) .      on the way to our proof 
 , we shall develop a few general combinatorial tools to deal with growth rates of countable graphs , which may be of independent interest . 
 we define a countable graph @xmath19 with bounded ( outgoing ) degree to have _ bounded cycles _ if it has finitely many closed paths of any given length . in this case 
 , we define the _ growth rate _ of @xmath19 as the growth rate with @xmath20 of the number of closed paths of length @xmath20 ( see definition [ d : growth ] ) ; as it turns out ( theorem [ t : rootofp ] ) , the inverse of the growth rate equals the smallest zero of the following function @xmath21 , constructed by counting the multi - cycles in the graph : @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the number of components of the multi - cycle @xmath24 , and @xmath25 is its length . 
 ( for the definition of multi - cycle , see section [ s : graphs ] ; note that our graphs have finite outgoing degree but possibly infinite ingoing degree , hence the adjacency operator has infinite @xmath26-norm and the usual spectral theory ( see e.g. @xcite ) does not apply ) . 
 we then define a general combinatorial object , called _ labeled wedge _ , which consists of pairs of integers which can be labeled either as being _ separated _ ( representing two elements of the postcritical set which lie on opposite sides of the critical point ) or _ non - separated _ ; to such object we associate an infinite graph , and prove that it has bounded cycles , hence one can apply the theory developed in the first part ( see theorem [ t : zero ] ) . 
 finally , we shall apply these combinatorial techniques to the core entropy ( section [ s : core ] ) ; indeed , we associate to any external angle @xmath3 a labeled wedge @xmath27 , hence an infinite graph @xmath28 , and verify that :    1 . 
 the growth rate of @xmath28 varies continuously as a function of @xmath3 ( theorem [ t : newmain ] ) ; 2 . 
 the growth rate of @xmath28 coincides with the core entropy for rational angles ( theorem [ t : coincide ] ) . 
 let us remark that , as a consequence of monotonicity along veins and theorem [ t : main ] , the continuous extension we define also coincides with the core entropy for parameters which are not necessarily postcritically finite , but for which the julia set is locally connected and the hubbard tree is topologically finite .      the core entropy of polynomials has been introduced by w. thurston around 2011 ( even though there are earlier related results , e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) but most of the theory is yet unpublished ( with the exception of section 6 in @xcite ) . 
 several people are now collecting his writings and correspondence into a foundational paper @xcite . 
 in particular , the validity of thurston s algorithm has been proven by tan l. , gao y. , and w. jung ( see @xcite , @xcite ) . 
 continuity of the core entropy along principal veins in the mandelbrot set is proven by the author in @xcite , and along all veins by w. jung @xcite . 
 note that the previous methods used for veins do not easily generalize , since the topology of the tree is constant along veins but not globally . 
 after @xcite , alternative proofs of monotonicity and continuity of entropy for real maps are given in @xcite , @xcite ( the present proof independently yields continuity ) . 
 biaccessible external angles and their dimension have been discussed in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite . 
 the method we use to count closed paths in the graph bears many similarities with the theory of _ dynamical zeta functions _ 
 @xcite , and several forms of the spectral determinant are used in thermodynamic formalism ( see e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) . moreover , the spectral determinant @xmath21 we use is an infinite version of the _ clique polynomial _ used in @xcite to study finite directed graphs with small entropy .      the motivation for our combinatorial construction is thurston s algorithm to compute the core entropy for rational angles , which we shall now describe . 
 let @xmath2 a rational number @xmath29 . 
 then the external ray at angle @xmath3 in the mandelbrot set lands at a misiurewicz parameter , or at the root of a hyperbolic component : let @xmath1 denote the corresponding postcritically finite quadratic map . we shall call @xmath30 the critical point of @xmath1 , and for each @xmath31 , @xmath32 the @xmath33 iterate of the critical point . 
 recall that the _ hubbard tree _ of @xmath1 is the union of the regulated arcs @xmath34 $ ] for all @xmath35 ( for more details , see @xcite ) . in the postcritically finite case , it is a finite topological tree , and it is forward - invariant under @xmath1 ( see figure [ f : tree ] ) . 
 it is possible to compute the core entropy of @xmath1 by writing the markov transition matrix for the action of @xmath1 on the tree , and take the logarithm of its leading eigenvalue . 
 however , given the external angle @xmath3 it is quite complicated to figure out the topology of the tree : the following algorithm by - passes this issue by looking at pairs of external angles .    in order to explain the algorithm in more detail , 
 let us remark that a rational angle @xmath3 is eventually periodic under the doubling map @xmath36 ; that is , there exist integers @xmath37 and @xmath38 such that the elements of the set @xmath39 are all distinct modulo @xmath40 , and @xmath41 . 
 the elements of @xmath42 will be called _ postcritical angles _ ; the number @xmath43 is called the _ period _ of @xmath3 , and @xmath44 is the _ pre - period_. if @xmath45 , we shall call @xmath3 _ 
 purely periodic_. denote @xmath46 the partition of the circle @xmath47 in the two intervals @xmath48 moreover , for each @xmath49 let us denote @xmath50 , which we see as a point in @xmath51 . 
 let us now construct a matrix @xmath52 which will be used to compute the core entropy . denote @xmath53 the set of unordered pairs of ( distinct ) elements of @xmath42 : this is a finite set , any element of which will be denoted @xmath54 . 
 we now define a linear map @xmath55 by defining it on its basis vectors in the following way :    * if @xmath56 and @xmath57 belong to the same element of the partition @xmath46 , or at least one of them lies on the boundary , we shall say that the pair @xmath54 is _ non - separated _ , and define @xmath58 * if @xmath56 and @xmath57 belong to the interiors of two different elements of @xmath46 , then we say that @xmath54 is _ separated _ , and define @xmath59 ( in order to make sure the formulas are defined in all cases , we shall set @xmath60 whenever @xmath61 ) .    by abuse of notation , we shall also denote @xmath52 the matrix representing the linear map @xmath52 in the standard basis . as suggested by thurston in his correspondence , 
 the leading eigenvalue of @xmath52 gives the core entropy :    [ t : algo ] let @xmath3 a rational angle.then the core entropy @xmath5 of the quadratic polynomial of external angle @xmath3 is related to the largest real eigenvalue @xmath62 of the matrix @xmath52 by the formula @xmath63    the explanation of this algorithm is the following . 
 let @xmath64 be a complete graph whose vertices are labeled by elements of @xmath42 , and which we shall consider as a topological space . 
 ( more concretely , we can take the unit disk and draw segments between all possible pairs of postcritical angles on the unit circle : the union of all such segments is a model for @xmath64 ( see figure [ f : chords_algo ] ) ) . 
 let us denote by @xmath65 the hubbard tree of @xmath1 . 
 we can define a continuous map @xmath66 which sends the edge with vertices @xmath56 , @xmath57 homeomorphically to the regulated arc @xmath34 $ ] in @xmath65 ( except in the case @xmath67 , where we map all the edge to a single point ) . finally , we can lift the dynamics @xmath68 to a map @xmath69 such that @xmath70 . in order to do so , 
 note that :    * if the pair of angles @xmath54 is non - separated , then @xmath1 maps the arc @xmath34 $ ] homeomorphically onto @xmath71 $ ] ; hence to define @xmath72 we have to lift @xmath1 so that it maps the edge @xmath73 $ ] homeomorphically onto @xmath74 $ ] ; * if instead @xmath54 is separated , then the critical point @xmath30 lies on the regulated arc @xmath34 $ ] in the hubbard tree ; thus , @xmath1 maps the arc @xmath75 = [ c_i , c_0 ] \cup [ c_0 , c_j]$ ] onto @xmath76 \cup [ c_1 , c_{j+1}]$ ] ; so we define @xmath72 by lifting @xmath1 and so that it maps @xmath73 $ ] continuously onto the union @xmath77 \cup [ x_1 , x_{j+1}]$ ] . 
 the map @xmath72 is a markov map of a topological graph , hence its entropy is the logarithm of the leading eigenvalue of its transition matrix , which is by construction the matrix @xmath52 . in case @xmath3 
 is purely periodic , one can prove that the map @xmath78 is surjective and finite - to - one , and semiconjugates the dynamics @xmath72 on @xmath64 to the dynamics @xmath1 on @xmath65 , hence @xmath79 more care is needed in the pre - periodic case , since @xmath78 can collapse arcs to points ( for details , see @xcite , @xcite , or @xcite ) . 
 in the following , by _ graph _ we mean a directed graph @xmath19 , i.e. a set @xmath80 of vertices ( which will be finite or countable ) and a set @xmath81 of edges , such that each edge @xmath82 has a well - defined _ source _ @xmath83 and a _ target _ @xmath84 
 ( thus , we allow edges between a vertex and itself , and multiple edges between two vertices ) . given a vertex @xmath85 , 
 the set @xmath86 of its _ outgoing edges _ is the set of edges with source @xmath85 . 
 the _ outgoing degree _ of @xmath85 is the cardinality of @xmath86 ; a graph is _ locally finite _ if the outgoing degree of all its vertices is finite , and has _ bounded outgoing degree _ if there is a uniform upper bound @xmath87 on the outgoing degree of all its vertices . 
 note that we do _ not _ require that the ingoing degree is finite , and indeed in our application we will encounter graphs with vertices having countably many ingoing edges .    we denote as @xmath88 the set of vertices of @xmath19 , and as @xmath89 its set of edges . 
 moreover , we denote as @xmath90 the number of edges from vertex @xmath85 to vertex @xmath91 . 
 a _ path _ in the graph based at a vertex @xmath85 is a sequence @xmath92 of edges such that @xmath93 , and @xmath94 for @xmath95 . 
 the _ length _ of the path is the number @xmath20 of edges , and the set of vertices @xmath96 visited by the path is called its _ vertex - suppoert _ , or just _ support _ for simplicity . 
 similarly , a _ closed path _ based at @xmath85 is a path @xmath92 such that @xmath97 . 
 note that in this definition a closed path can intersect itself , i.e. two of the sources of the @xmath98 can be the same ; moreover , closed paths with different starting vertices will be considered to be different .    on the other hand , a _ 
 simple cycle _ is a closed path which does not self - intersect , modulo cyclical equivalence : that is , a simple cycle is a closed path @xmath92 such that @xmath99 for @xmath100 , and two such paths are considered the same simple cycle if the edges are cyclically permuted , i.e. @xmath92 and @xmath101 designate the same simple cycle . 
 finally , a _ 
 multi - cycle _ is the union of finitely many simple cycles with pairwise disjoint ( vertex-)supports . the length of a multi - cycle is the sum of the lengths of its components .    given a countable graph with bounded outgoing degree , we define the _ adjacency operator _ 
 @xmath102 on the space of summable sequences indexed by the vertex set @xmath80 . 
 in fact , for each vertex @xmath103 we can consider the sequence @xmath104 which is @xmath40 at position @xmath49 and @xmath105 otherwise , and define for each @xmath106 the @xmath107 component of the vector @xmath108 to be @xmath109 equal to the number of edges from @xmath49 to @xmath110 . 
 since the graph has bounded outgoing degree , the above definition can actually be extended to all @xmath111 , and the operator norm of @xmath112 induced by the @xmath113-norm is bounded above by the outgoing degree @xmath114 of the graph . 
 note moreover that for each pair @xmath115 of vertices and each @xmath20 , the coefficient @xmath116 equals the number of paths of length @xmath20 from @xmath49 to @xmath110 . 
 we say a countable graph @xmath19 has _ bounded cycles _ if it has bounded outgoing degree and for each positive integer @xmath20 , @xmath19 has at most finitely many simple cycles of length @xmath20 .    note that , if @xmath19 has bounded cycles , then for each @xmath20 it has also a finite number of closed paths of length @xmath20 , since the support of any closed path of length @xmath20 is contained in the union of the supports of simple cycles with length @xmath117 . 
 thus , for such graphs we shall denote @xmath118 the number of closed paths of length @xmath20 . 
 note that in this case the trace @xmath119 is also well - defined for each @xmath20 , and equal to @xmath120 . 
 [ d : growth ] if @xmath19 is a graph with bounded cycles , we define the _ growth rate _ @xmath121 as the exponential growth rate of the number of its closed paths : that is , @xmath122{c(\gamma , n)}.\ ] ]      if @xmath19 is a finite graph with adjacency matrix @xmath112 , then is well - defined its characteristic polynomial @xmath123 , whose roots are the eigenvalues of @xmath112 . in the following 
 we shall work with the related polynomial @xmath124 which we call the _ spectral determinant _ of @xmath19 . 
 we shall now extend the theory to countable graphs with bounded cycles . 
 it is known that the spectral determinant @xmath21 of a finite graph @xmath19 is related to its multi - cycles by the following formula ( see e.g. @xcite ) : @xmath125 where @xmath25 denotes the length of the multi - cycle @xmath24 , while @xmath23 is the number of connected components of @xmath24 . 
 if @xmath19 is now a ( directed ) graph with countably many vertices and bounded cycles , then the number of multi - cycles of any given length is finite , hence the formula above is still defined as a formal power series . 
 note that we include also the empty cycle , which has zero components and zero length , hence @xmath21 begins with the constant term @xmath40 . 
 now , let @xmath126 denote the number of multi - cycles of length @xmath20 in @xmath19 , and let us define @xmath127{k(\gamma , n)}\ ] ] its growth rate . 
 then the main result of this section is the following :    [ t : rootofp ] suppose we have @xmath128 ; then the formula defines a holomorphic function @xmath129 in the unit disk @xmath130 , and moreover the function @xmath129 is non - zero in the disk @xmath131 ; if @xmath132 , we also have @xmath133 . 
 the proof uses in a crucial way the following combinatorial statement . 
 [ l:1/pt ] let @xmath19 be a countable graph with bounded cycles , and @xmath112 its adjacency operator . 
 then we have the equalities of formal power series @xmath134 where @xmath21 is the spectral determinant . 
 note that , since @xmath21 is a power series with constant term @xmath40 , then @xmath135 is indeed a well - defined power series . 
 the second equality is just obtained by expanding the exponential function in power series . to prove the first equality , 
 let us first suppose @xmath19 is a finite graph with @xmath20 vertices , and let @xmath136 be the eigenvalues of its adjacency matrix ( counted with algebraic multiplicity ) . 
 then @xmath137 hence @xmath138 hence the claim follows since @xmath139 . 
 now , let @xmath19 be infinite with bounded cycles , and let @xmath140 . 
 note that both sides of the equation depend , modulo @xmath141 , only on multi - cycles of length @xmath142 , which by the bounded cycle condition are supported on a finite subgraph @xmath143 . 
 thus by applying the previous proof to @xmath143 we obtain equality modulo @xmath141 , and since this holds for any @xmath144 the claim is proven .    by the root test 
 , the radius of convergence of @xmath145 is @xmath146 . 
 thus , since the exponential function has infinite radius of convergence , the radius of convergence of @xmath147 is at least @xmath146 , and since @xmath148 where @xmath149 has positive coefficients , then the radius of convergence of @xmath147 is exactly equal to @xmath146 . 
 hence , by lemma [ l:1/pt ] , the radius of convergence of @xmath135 around @xmath150 is also @xmath146 . on the other hand , since @xmath128 , then by the root test the power series @xmath21 converges inside the unit disk , and defines a holomorphic function ; thus , @xmath135 is meromorphic for @xmath151 , and holomorphic for @xmath152 , hence @xmath153 if @xmath152 . moreover , 
 if @xmath154 , then the radius of convergence of @xmath135 equals the smallest modulus of one of its poles , hence @xmath146 is the smallest modulus of a zero of @xmath21 . 
 finally , since @xmath135 has all its taylor coefficients real and nonnegative , then the smallest modulus of its poles must also be a pole , so @xmath133 . 
 [ l : perroneig ] if @xmath19 is a finite graph , then its growth rate equals the largest real eigenvalue of its adjacency matrix . 
 note that , by the perron - frobenius theorem , since the adjacency matrix is non - negative , it has at least one real eigenvalue whose modulus is at least as large as the modulus of any other eigenvalue . moreover , if @xmath62 is the largest real eigenvalue , then @xmath155 is the smallest root of the spectral determinant @xmath21 , hence the claim follows from theorem [ t : rootofp ] . 
 let @xmath156 two ( locally finite ) graphs . 
 a _ graph map _ from @xmath157 to @xmath158 is a map @xmath159 on the vertex sets and a map on edges @xmath160 which is compatible , in the sense that if the edge @xmath82 connects @xmath85 to @xmath91 in @xmath157 , then the edge @xmath161 connects @xmath162 to @xmath163 in @xmath158 . 
 we shall usually denote such a map as @xmath164 . 
 weak cover _ of graphs is a graph map @xmath164 such that :    * the map @xmath159 between the vertex sets is surjective ; * the induced map @xmath165 between outgoing edges is a bijection for each @xmath166 . 
 note that the map between outgoing edges is defined because @xmath167 is a graph map , and @xmath167 also induces a map from paths in @xmath157 to paths in @xmath158 . as a consequence of the definition of weak cover , you have the following _ unique path lifting _ property :    let @xmath164 a weak cover of graphs . then given @xmath166 and @xmath168 , for every path @xmath24 in @xmath158 based at @xmath91 
 there is a unique path @xmath169 in @xmath157 based at @xmath85 such that @xmath170 . 
 let @xmath166 and @xmath168 , and let @xmath171 be a path in @xmath158 based at @xmath91 . since the map @xmath172 is a bijection , there exists exactly one edge @xmath173 such that @xmath174 . by compatibility , the target @xmath175 of @xmath176 projects to the target of @xmath177 , 
 hence we can apply the same reasoning and lift the second edge @xmath178 uniquely starting from @xmath175 , and so on . 
 an immediate consequence of the property is the following    [ l : easyineq ] each graph map @xmath164 induces a map @xmath179 for each @xmath180 and each @xmath181 . 
 moreveor , if @xmath167 is a weak cover , then @xmath182 is injective . 
 a general way to construct weak covers of graphs is the following . 
 suppose we have an equivalence relation @xmath183 on the vertex set @xmath80 of a locally finite graph , and denote @xmath184 the set of equivalence classes of vertices . 
 such an equivalence relation is called _ edge - compatible _ if whenever @xmath185 , for any vertex @xmath91 the total number of edges from @xmath186 to the members of the equivalence class of @xmath91 equals the total number of edges from @xmath187 to the members of the equivalence class of @xmath91 . 
 when we have such an equivalence relation , we can define a quotient graph @xmath188 with vertex set @xmath184 . 
 namely , we denote for each @xmath189 the respective equivalence classes as @xmath190 $ ] and @xmath191 $ ] , and define the number of edges from @xmath190 $ ] to @xmath191 $ ] in the quotient graph to be @xmath192 \to [ w ] ) : = \sum_{u \in [ w ] } \#(v \to u).\ ] ] by definition of edge - compatibility , the above sum does not depend on the representative @xmath85 chosen inside the class @xmath190 $ ] . 
 moreover , it is easy to see that the quotient map @xmath193 is a weak cover of graphs . 
 let us now relate the growth of a graph to the growth of its weak covers . 
 [ l : growthcover ] let @xmath164 a weak cover of graphs with bounded cycles , and @xmath194 a finite set of vertices of @xmath157 .    1 . 
 suppose that every closed path in @xmath157 passes through @xmath194 . 
 then for each @xmath20 we have the estimate @xmath195 which implies @xmath196 2 . 
 suppose that @xmath197 is a set of closed paths in @xmath158 such that each @xmath198 crosses at least one vertex @xmath91 with the property that : the set @xmath199 is non - empty , and any lift of @xmath24 from an element of @xmath200 ends in @xmath200 . 
 then there exists @xmath201 , which depends on @xmath194 , such that for each @xmath20 we have @xmath202    \(1 ) let @xmath24 be a closed path in @xmath157 of length @xmath20 , based at @xmath85 . 
 let now @xmath203 be the first vertex of @xmath24 which belongs to @xmath194 ( by hypothesis , there is one ) . 
 if we call @xmath204 the cyclical permutation of @xmath24 based at @xmath203 , the projection of @xmath204 to @xmath158 now yields a closed path @xmath205 in @xmath158 which is based at @xmath206 . now note that for each such pair @xmath207 , there are at most @xmath208 possible choices for @xmath209 ; then , given @xmath203 there is a unique lift of @xmath205 from @xmath203 , and @xmath20 possible choices for the vertex @xmath85 on that lift , giving the estimate . 
 \(2 ) recall first that in every directed graph we can define an equivalence relation by saying @xmath210 if there is a path from @xmath85 to @xmath91 and a path from @xmath91 to @xmath85 . 
 the equivalence classes are known as _ strongly connected components _ , or @xmath211 for short . 
 moreover , we can form a graph @xmath212 whose vertices are the strongly connected components and there is an edge from the s.c.c . 
 @xmath213 to @xmath214 if in the original graph there is a path from an element of @xmath213 to an element of @xmath214 . 
 note that by construction this graph has no cycles . 
 moreover , let us consider a pair @xmath215 of distinct elements of @xmath194 ; then either there is no path from @xmath186 to @xmath187 , or we can pick some path from @xmath186 to @xmath187 , which will be denoted @xmath216 . 
 then the set @xmath217 of such paths is finite , and let @xmath72 be the maximum length of an element of @xmath218 . 
 let now @xmath24 be a closed path in @xmath158 based at @xmath219 . by hypothesis 
 , @xmath24 passes through some @xmath91 such that @xmath220 , and each lift of @xmath24 from @xmath200 ends in @xmath200 . 
 let us now consider the set @xmath221 of all s.c.c . of @xmath157 which intersect @xmath200 : 
 since the graph @xmath212 constructed above has no cycles , there is a component @xmath222 which has the property that there is no path from @xmath223 to some other component of @xmath200 . 
 thus , if we pick @xmath224 and lift @xmath24 from @xmath85 to a path @xmath169 in @xmath157 , the endpoint @xmath175 of @xmath169 must lie inside @xmath200 by hypothesis . 
 thus , by the property of @xmath223 , the vertex @xmath175 lies in @xmath223 , hence there is a path @xmath225 from @xmath175 to @xmath85 in the previously chosen set @xmath218 , hence if we take @xmath226 , this is a closed path in @xmath157 of length between @xmath20 and @xmath227 . 
 thus we have a map @xmath228 given by @xmath229 . 
 now , given @xmath85 we can recover @xmath230 , and given @xmath205 we can recover @xmath24 , since @xmath24 is the path given by the first @xmath20 edges of @xmath231 starting at @xmath91 . finally , we have at most @xmath20 choices for the starting point @xmath219 on @xmath24 , hence the fibers of the above map have cardinality at most @xmath20 , proving the claim .    an immediate corollary of the lemma is the following , when @xmath157 and @xmath158 are both finite . 
 [ l : sameentro ] let @xmath156 be finite graphs , and @xmath164 a weak cover . 
 then the growth rate of @xmath157 equals the growth rate of @xmath158 . 
 apply the lemma with @xmath232 , and @xmath197 equal to the set of all closed paths in @xmath158 . 
 let us consider the set @xmath233 of pairs of disjoint positive integers . 
 the set @xmath234 will be sometimes called the _ wedge _ and , given an element @xmath235 , the coordinate @xmath49 will be called the _ height _ of @xmath85 , while the coordinate @xmath110 will be called the _ width _ of @xmath85 . 
 the terminology becomes more clear by looking at figure [ f : wedge ] . 
 @xmath236    we call a _ labeled wedge _ an assignment @xmath237 of a label @xmath238 ( which stands for _ non - separated _ ) or @xmath194 ( which stands for _ separated _ ) to each element of @xmath234 . 
 now , to each labeled wedge @xmath239 we assign a graph @xmath240 in the following way . 
 the vertex set of @xmath240 is the wedge @xmath234 , while the edges of @xmath240 are labeled by the set @xmath241 and determined according to the following rule .    * 
 if @xmath242 is non - separated , then @xmath243 has as its ( unique ) successor the vertex @xmath244 ; we say that the edge @xmath245 is an _ upward edge _ and we label it with @xmath246 ; * if @xmath247 is separated , then @xmath247 has two successors : * * first , we add the edge @xmath248 , which we call _ forward edge _ and label it with @xmath249 . * * second , we add the edge @xmath250 , which we call _ backward edge _ and label it with @xmath251 .    in order to explain the names , note that following an upward or forward edge increases the width by @xmath40 , while following a backward edge ( weakly ) decreases it . moreover , following an upward edge increases the height by @xmath40 , while the targets of both backward and forward edges have height @xmath40 . 
 @xmath252\txt{(2,4 ) }    & ( 2,5 ) & \cdots \\ * + [ f]\txt{(1,2 ) }   & ( 1,3 )    & * + [ f]\txt{(1,4 ) }   & ( 1,5 ) & \cdots \\ } \ ] ]    @xmath253^u & ( 3,5 ) & \cdots \\ & ( 2,3 )   \ar[ur]^u & * + [ f]\txt{(2,4 ) } \ar[dr]^f   \ar@/_/[dl]_b & ( 2,5 ) & \cdots \\ * + [ f]\txt{(1,2 ) } \ar@(u , l)_b   \ar[r]^f & ( 1,3 ) \ar[ur]_u   & * + [ f]\txt{(1,4 ) } \ar[r]^f \ar@/^/[ll]^b & ( 1,5 ) & \cdots \\ } \ ] ]    [ p : properties ] let @xmath240 the graph associated to the labeled wedge @xmath239 
 . then the following are true :    1 . 
 each vertex of a closed path of length @xmath20 has height at most @xmath20 ; 2 . 
 the support of each closed path of length @xmath20 intersects the set @xmath254 ; 3 . 
 each vertex of a closed path of length @xmath20 has width at most @xmath255 ; 4 .   for each @xmath256 
 , there exists at most one separated vertex in the @xmath257 diagonal @xmath258 which is contained in the support of at least one closed path ; 5 .   there are at most @xmath259 multi - cycles of length @xmath20 . 
 note that ( 1 ) , ( 2 ) , ( 3 ) are sharp , as seen by the simple cycle @xmath260^u & 25 \ar@/^/[r]^u   & * + [ f]\txt{36 } \ar@/^/[ll]^b } \ ] ]    \(1 ) let us first note that every closed path contains at least one backward edge , since the upward and forward edges always increase the height . 
 moreover , the endpoint of a backward edge has always height @xmath40 , and each edge increases the height by at most @xmath40 , hence the height of a vertex along the closed path is at most @xmath20 . 
 \(2 ) since the target of each backward edge is @xmath261 , where @xmath49 is the height of the source of the edge , which is at most @xmath20 by the previous point , then the target of each backward edge along the closed path belongs to the set @xmath262 . 
 \(3 ) by the previous point , there is at least a vertex along the closed path with width at most @xmath263 . 
 since every move increases the width by at most @xmath40 , then the largest possible width of a vertex along the path is @xmath264 . 
 \(4 ) let @xmath265 be the separated vertex in @xmath266 with smallest height , if there is one . 
 we claim that no vertex @xmath267 of @xmath266 with @xmath268 belongs to any closed path . note by looking at the rules that , if a vertex @xmath269 of height @xmath270 is the target of some edge , then it must be the target of an upward edge , more precisely an edge from the vertex @xmath271 immediately to the lower left of @xmath85 , which then must be non - separated . 
 thus , since @xmath272 is separated , the vertex @xmath273 does not belong to any closed path ; the claim then follows by induction on @xmath274 , since , by the same reasoning , if @xmath275 belongs to some closed path , then also @xmath276 must belong to the same path . 
 \(5 ) let @xmath277 the backward edges along a multi - cycle @xmath24 of length @xmath20 , and denote @xmath278 the source of @xmath98 , and @xmath279 the height of @xmath278 . 
 note that the set @xmath280 determines @xmath24 , as you can start from @xmath186 , follow the backward edge , and then follow upward or forward edges until you either close the loop or encounter another @xmath278 , and then continue this way until you walk along all of @xmath24 . 
 moreover , we know that for each @xmath278 there are at most @xmath255 possible choices , as each @xmath278 is separated and by ( 4 ) there is at most one for each diagonal @xmath266 , and by ( 3 ) it must lie on some @xmath266 with @xmath281 . 
 we now claim that @xmath282 which is then sufficient to complete the proof . 
 let us now prove the claim . by definition of multi - cycle , then the targets of the @xmath98 must be all distinct , and by the rule these targets are precisely @xmath283 with @xmath284 , hence all @xmath279 must be distinct . moreover , let us note that each @xmath98 must be preceded along the multi - cycle by a sequence @xmath285 of upward edges of length @xmath286 , and all such sequences for distinct @xmath49 must be disjoint . 
 hence we have that all @xmath279 are distinct and their total sum is at most the length of the multi - cycle , i.e. @xmath20 . thus we have @xmath287 which proves the claim . 
 [ t : zero ] let @xmath239 be a labeled wedge . then its associated graph @xmath19 has bounded cycles , and its spectral determinant @xmath21 defines a holomorphic function in the unit disk . 
 moreover , the growth rate @xmath288 of the graph @xmath19 equals the inverse of the smallest real positive root of @xmath129 , in the following sense : @xmath289 for @xmath131 and , if @xmath132 , then @xmath133 .    by construction , 
 the outgoing degree of any vertex of @xmath19 is at most @xmath290 . 
 moreover , by proposition [ p : properties ] ( 5 ) the graph has bounded cycles , and the growth rate of the number @xmath126 of multi - cycles is @xmath291 , since @xmath292{(2n)^{\sqrt{2n } } } = \limsup_{n } e^{\frac{\sqrt{2 } \log(2n)}{\sqrt{n } } } = 1.\ ] ] the claim then follows by theorem [ t : rootofp ] . 
 we shall sometimes denote as @xmath293 the growth rate of the graph associated to the labeled wedge @xmath239 . 
 we say that a sequence @xmath294 of labeled wedges converges to @xmath239 if for each finite set of vertices @xmath295 there exists @xmath238 such for each @xmath296 the labels of the elements of @xmath194 for @xmath297 and @xmath239 are the same . 
 [ l : contwedge ] if a sequence of labeled wedges @xmath294 converges to @xmath239 , then the growth rate of @xmath297 converges to the growth rate of @xmath239 . 
 let @xmath298 and @xmath21 denote respectively the spectral determinants of @xmath297 and @xmath239 . 
 then for each @xmath256 , the coefficient of @xmath299 in @xmath298 converges to the coefficient of @xmath299 in @xmath21 , because by proposition [ p : properties ] ( 1 ) and ( 3 ) the support of any multi - cycle of length @xmath300 is contained in the finite subgraph @xmath301 . 
 thus , since the modulus of the coefficient of @xmath299 is uniformly bounded above by @xmath302 , then @xmath303 uniformly on compact subsets of the unit disk . 
 thus , by rouch s theorem , the smallest real positive zero of @xmath298 converges to the smallest real positive zero of @xmath21 , hence by theorem [ t : zero ] we have @xmath304 . 
 given integers @xmath37 and @xmath38 we define the equivalence relation @xmath305 on @xmath306 by saying that @xmath307 if :    * either @xmath308 and @xmath309 ; * or @xmath310 and @xmath311 
 .    note that if @xmath45 the equivalence relation @xmath312 is simply the congruence modulo @xmath43 . 
 a set of representatives for the equivalence classes of @xmath312 is the set @xmath313 . 
 the equivalence relation induces an equivalence relation on the set @xmath314 of ordered pairs of integers by saying that @xmath315 
 if @xmath316 and @xmath317 . moreover , it also induces an equivalence relation on the set of _ unordered pairs _ of integers by saying that the unordered pair @xmath318 is equivalent to @xmath319 if either @xmath320 or @xmath321 . 
 a labeled wedge is _ periodic _ of period @xmath43 and pre - period @xmath44 if the following two conditions hold :    * any two pairs @xmath247 and @xmath322 such that @xmath323 have the same label ; * if @xmath307 , then the pair @xmath247 is non - separated . 
 if @xmath324 , the labeled wedge will be called _ purely periodic_.    a pair @xmath247 with @xmath325 will be called _ diagonal _ ; hence the second point in the definition can be rephrased as  every diagonal pair is non - separated "" .

 the set of vertices of @xmath328 is the set of @xmath312-equivalence classes of non - diagonal , unordered pairs of integers . 
 a set of representatives of @xmath329 is the set @xmath330 the edges of @xmath328 are induced by the edges of @xmath19 , that is are determined by the following rules : if the unordered pair @xmath318 is non - separated , then @xmath318 has one outgoing edge , namely @xmath331 ; while if @xmath318 is separated , then @xmath318 has the two outgoing edges @xmath332 , and @xmath333 .    the main result of this section is the following .    [ 
 p : finiteinfinite ] let @xmath239 be a periodic labeled edge , with associated ( infinite ) graph @xmath19 
 . then the growth rate of @xmath19 equals the growth rate of its finite model @xmath328 .    in order to prove the proposition 
 , we shall also introduce an intermediate finite graph , which we call the _ 
 finite 2-cover _ of @xmath328 , and denote @xmath334 . 
 the set of vertices of @xmath334 is the set of @xmath305-equivalence classes of non - diagonal , ordered pairs of integers , and the edges are induced by the edges of @xmath19 in the usual way . 
 the reason to introduce the intermediate graph @xmath334 is that @xmath328 does not inherit the labeling of edges from @xmath19 , as backward and forward edges in @xmath19 may map to the same edge in @xmath328 , while @xmath334 naturally inherits the labels . 
 let @xmath19 be the graph associated to a periodic labeled wedge .    1 . 
 first , let us observe that no diagonal vertex is contained in the support of any closed path of @xmath19 : in fact , every diagonal vertex is non - separated , and its outgoing edge leads to another diagonal vertex with larger height , hence the path can never close up . 
 thus , we can construct the subgraph @xmath335 by taking as vertices all pairs which are non - diagonal , and as edges all the edges of @xmath19 which do not have either as a source or target a diagonal pair . by 
 what has been just said , the growth rate of @xmath19 and @xmath335 is the same , @xmath336 2 .   since 
 the maps @xmath337 are given by quotienting with respect to equivalence relations , they are both weak covers of graphs . thus , 
 since both @xmath334 and @xmath328 are finite , by lemma [ l : sameentro ] , the growth rates of @xmath334 and @xmath328 are the same . 
 we are now left with proving that the growth rate of @xmath335 is the same as the growth rate of @xmath334 . 
 since the cardinality of the fiber of the projection @xmath338 is infinite , the statement is not immediate . 
 note that the finite @xmath290-cover @xmath334 is a graph with labeled edges : indeed , if @xmath320 , then @xmath339 , and so on , thus the labeling of @xmath334 inherited from @xmath19 is well - defined , and the graph map @xmath338 preserves the labels . 
 4 .   let us call _ backtracking _ a path in @xmath19 or @xmath334 such that at least one of its edges is labeled by @xmath251 (= backward ) , and _ non - backtracking _ otherwise . now let us note the following : 1 . 
 every closed path in @xmath19 is backtracking ; in fact , following any edge which is upward or forward increases the height , thus a path in @xmath19 made entirely of @xmath246 and @xmath249 edges can not close up . 
 2 .   every closed path in @xmath19 passes through the finite set @xmath340 in order to prove this , we first prove that any element in the support of any closed path in @xmath19 has height at most @xmath341 . in order to do so , 
 let us fix a diagonal @xmath342 . 
 by periodicity , either there is a separated pair @xmath247 in @xmath266 of height @xmath343 , or all elements of @xmath266 are non - separated ; in the latter case , no element of @xmath266 is part of any closed path , since any path based at an element of @xmath266 is non - backtracking . in the first case , 
 let @xmath344 be the separated pair with smallest height in @xmath266 ; then , only the elements with height less than @xmath345 can be part of any closed path , and @xmath346 , so the first claim is proven . as a consequence , 
 the target of any @xmath251-labeled edge which belongs to some closed path is of type @xmath347 , where @xmath348 is the height of the source , hence the target belongs to @xmath194 . by the same reasoning , 
 if @xmath24 is any path in @xmath19 based at a vertex of height @xmath40 , then the target of any @xmath251-labeled edge along @xmath24 lies in @xmath194 . 
 3 .   every backtracking closed path in @xmath334 has at least one @xmath251-labeled edge , hence the target of such @xmath251-labeled edge lies in the set @xmath349 , and every lift to @xmath19 starting from an element of @xmath194 must end in the target of a @xmath251-labeled edge in @xmath19 , hence must end in @xmath194 . 
 5 .   finally , let us note that for each @xmath20 , the number of non - backtracking paths of length @xmath20 in @xmath334 is at most the cardinality of @xmath350 ; indeed , from each vertex there is at most one edge labeled @xmath246 or @xmath249 , thus for each vertex of @xmath334 there is at most one non - backtracking path of length @xmath20 based at it . 
 let us now put together the previous statements . 
 indeed , by ( 4)(a)-(b ) every closed path in @xmath19 passes through @xmath194 , hence we can apply lemma [ l : growthcover ] ( 1 ) and get that @xmath351 to prove the other inequality , let us note that by ( 4)(b)-(c ) we know that lemma [ l : growthcover ] ( 2 ) applies with @xmath197 the set of backtracking closed paths in @xmath334 . 
 moreover , by point ( 5 ) above we have that the number of non - backtracking paths is bounded independently of @xmath20 : thus we can write @xmath352 @xmath353 from which follows @xmath354 as required .    when dealing with purely periodic external angles , we shall also need the following lemma . 
 [ l : twoperiodics ] let @xmath355 and @xmath356 be two labeled wedges which are purely periodic of period @xmath43 . 
 suppose moreover that for every pair @xmath247 with @xmath357 the label of @xmath243 in @xmath355 equals the label in @xmath356 
 . then the finite models @xmath358 and @xmath359 are isomorphic graphs . as a consequence , 
 the growth rates of @xmath355 and @xmath356 are equal . 
 let @xmath360 an equivalence class of unordered pairs . 
 if neither @xmath49 nor @xmath110 are divisible by @xmath43 , then the label of @xmath318 is the same in @xmath355 and @xmath356 , hence the outgoing edges from @xmath318 are the same in @xmath358 and @xmath359 . 
 suppose on the other hand that @xmath361 ( hence , @xmath362 because the pair is non - diagonal ) . 
 then , if the pair @xmath363 is non - separated , then its only outgoing edge goes to @xmath364 in @xmath365 . 
 on the other hand , if @xmath363 is separated , then its two possible outgoing edges are @xmath366 and @xmath367 . however , the pair @xmath366 is diagonal , hence no vertex in the graph has such label 
 . thus , independently of whether @xmath363 is separated , it has exactly one outgoing edge with target @xmath367 , proving the claim . 
 we shall now apply the theory of labeled wedges to the core entropy . as we have seen in section [ s : algo ] 
 , thurston s algorithm allows one to compute the core entropy for periodic angles @xmath3 ; in order to interpolate between periodic angles of different periods , we shall now define for _ any _ angle @xmath13 a labeled wedge @xmath27 , and thus an infinite graph @xmath368 as described in the previous sections . 
 recall that for each @xmath31 we denote @xmath50 , which we see as a point in @xmath51 . for each pair @xmath247 which belongs to @xmath234 , we label @xmath247 as _ non - separated _ 
 if @xmath369 and @xmath370 belong to the same element of the partition @xmath46 , or at least one of them lies on the boundary of the partition . 
 if instead @xmath369 and @xmath370 belong to the interiors of two different intervals of @xmath46 , then we label the pair @xmath247 as _ separated_. the labeled wedge just constructed will be denoted @xmath27 , and its associated graph @xmath28 . 
 the main quantity we will work with is the following :              let @xmath3 have period @xmath43 and pre - period @xmath44 . by definition of the equivalence relation @xmath312 , we have @xmath325 if and only if @xmath373 , which proves the first condition in the definition of periodic wedge . moreover , if @xmath247 is a diagonal pair , then @xmath374 , hence the pair @xmath247 is non - separated , verifying the second condition .    using the results of the previous section , we are now ready to prove that the logarithm of the growth rate of @xmath28 coincides with the core entropy for rational angles , proving the first part of theorem [ t : newmain ] . 
 let @xmath3 a rational angle , @xmath28 the infinite graph associated to the labeled wedge @xmath27 , and @xmath376 the finite model of @xmath28 as described in section [ s : finitemodel ] by unraveling the definitions , the matrix @xmath52 constructed in section [ s : algo ] is exactly the adjacency matrix of the finite model @xmath376 . by proposition [ p : finiteinfinite ] , the growth rate of @xmath28 coincides with the growth rate of its finite model @xmath376 . 
 moreover , by lemma [ l : perroneig ] , the growth rate of @xmath376 coincides with the largest real eigenvalue of its adjacency matrix , that is the largest real eigenvalue of @xmath52 . 
 thus , by theorem [ t : algo ] its logarithm is the core entropy @xmath5 .          as @xmath379 , the labeled wedge @xmath380 stabilizes . 
 in fact , for each @xmath49 consider the position of @xmath50 with respect to the partition @xmath46 . if @xmath381 , then , for all @xmath382 in a neighborhood of @xmath3 , @xmath383 lies on the same side of the partition . otherwise , note that for any @xmath384 and @xmath385 , the functions @xmath386 and @xmath387 are both continuous and orientation preserving but have different derivative : thus , for all @xmath388 close enough to @xmath3 , the point @xmath383 lies on one side of the partition , and for @xmath389 close enough to @xmath3 lies on the other side . 
 thus , the limits @xmath390_^+ : = _  ^+ _ , _ ^- : = _  ^- _ @xmath390 exist , and are both equal to @xmath380 if @xmath3 is not purely periodic , because then no @xmath369 with @xmath31 lies on the boundary of the partition . 
 the claim then follows by lemma [ l : contwedge ] . 
 this proves continuity of @xmath371 at all angles which are not purely periodic . 
 we shall now deal with the purely periodic case , where for the moment we only know that the left - hand side and right - hand side limits of @xmath371 exist . 
 [ l : diffpairs ] let @xmath3 be purely periodic of period @xmath43 
 . then @xmath27 , @xmath391 and @xmath392 are purely periodic of period @xmath43 , and differ only in the labelings of pairs @xmath247 with either @xmath361 or @xmath393 . 
 let @xmath3 be purely periodic of period @xmath43 . 
 note that @xmath369 lies on the boundary of the partition @xmath46 if and only if @xmath361 . 
 thus , for all the pairs @xmath247 for which neither component is divisible by @xmath43 , the label of @xmath247 is continuous across @xmath3 , proving the second statement . 
 now we shall show that if for all @xmath388 and close enough to @xmath3 one has @xmath394 on one side of the partition , then also @xmath395 is on the same side for each @xmath256 . 
 this will prove that @xmath396 is purely periodic of period @xmath43 . 
 the proof for @xmath397 is symmetric , and @xmath27 is purely periodic of period @xmath43 by lemma [ l : periodic ] . in order to prove the remaining claim , 
 let us denote @xmath398 , @xmath399 ; since @xmath3 is purely periodic , there exists @xmath400 such that @xmath401 for all @xmath256 . 
 now , note that for each @xmath256 the derivatives satisfy the inequality @xmath402 , thus for each @xmath256 there exists @xmath403 such that for each @xmath404 one has @xmath405 , hence the points @xmath406 all belong to the same side of the partition independently of @xmath300 , as required . 
 [ p : bothsides ] if @xmath3 is purely periodic of period @xmath43 , then the ( infinite ) graphs @xmath28 , @xmath407 and @xmath408 , associated respectively to @xmath27 , @xmath391 and @xmath392 have the same growth rate , i.e. we have the equality @xmath409    by lemma [ l : diffpairs ] and lemma [ l : twoperiodics ] , the graphs @xmath28 , @xmath407 and @xmath408 have the same finite form , hence by proposition [ p : finiteinfinite ] they have the same growth rate , proving the claim . 
 let @xmath2 , and denote by @xmath413 the smallest real zero of @xmath14 . 
 the proof is a simple quantitative version of rouch s theorem . for simplicity , 
 let us assume that @xmath3 is pre - periodic , and let @xmath414 be the minimum distance , in @xmath51 , between ( distinct ) elements of the set @xmath415 . 
 given another angle @xmath416 , denote @xmath417 the smallest real zero of @xmath418 , and choose @xmath20 such that @xmath419 then , by looking at how @xmath369 moves with respect to the partition @xmath46 , we realize that , for @xmath420 , the pair @xmath247 is separated for @xmath3 if and only if it is separated for @xmath416 . by construction , the @xmath421 coefficient of @xmath14 depends only on multi - cycles of total length @xmath20 , and by proposition [ p : properties ] ( 3 ) all such multi - cycles live on the subgraph @xmath422 , hence the first @xmath20 coefficients of @xmath14 and @xmath418 coincide . 
 thus we can write @xmath423 for some @xmath424 and @xmath425 , where we used that @xmath426 by proposition [ p : properties ] ( 5 ) . 
 now , using @xmath427 we have @xmath428 where @xmath256 is the order of zero of @xmath46 at @xmath429 and @xmath430 is a holomorphic function , with @xmath431 . by combining , and , we get @xmath432 with @xmath433 , which implies the claim as @xmath434 . in the periodic case 
 the proof the same , except one should argue separately for @xmath435 and @xmath436 , and use proposition [ p : bothsides ] .

"the layered organic material 3 ( ai3 ) , which has been studied since the 1980s,@xcite has recently attracted renewed interest because it reveals low - energy massless dirac fermions under hyrdostatic pressure ( @xmath2 gpa).@xcite compared to graphene , certainly the most popular material with low - energy dirac fermions@xcite or electronic states at the surface of three - dimensional topological insulators,@xcite ai3 is strikingly different in several respects . 
 apart from the tilt of the dirac cones and the anisotropy in the fermi surface,@xcite its average fermi velocity is roughly one order of magnitude smaller than that in graphene . 
 this , together with an experimentally identified low - temperature charge - ordered phase at ambient pressure,@xcite indicates the relevance of electronic correlations . 
 indeed , because the effective coupling constant for coulomb - type electron - electron interactions is inversely proportional to the fermi velocity , it is expected to be ten times larger in ai3 than in graphene . 
 the material ai3 thus opens the exciting prospective to study strongly - correlated dirac fermions that are beyond the scope of graphene electrons.@xcite . 
 another specificity of ai3 is the presence of additional massive carriers in the vicinity of the fermi level , as recently pointed out in ab - initio band - structure calculations.@xcite however , the interplay between massless dirac fermions and massive carriers has , to the best of our knowledge , not yet been proven experimentally . 
 finally , one should mention a topological merging of dirac points that is expected for high but experimentally accessible pressure.@xcite    here , we present magneto - transport measurements of ai3 crystals under hydrostatic pressure larger than @xmath3 gpa where dirac carriers are present . 
 we show not only the existence of high - mobility dirac carriers as reported elsewhere,@xcite but we prove also experimentally the presence of low - mobility massive holes , in agreement with recent band - structure calculations.@xcite the interplay between both carrier types at low energy is the main result of our studies . 
 furthermore , we show that the measured mobilities for the two carrier types hint at scattering mechanisms due to strongly screened interaction potentials or other short - range scatterers . 
 the remainder of the paper is organized as follows . in sec . 
 [ sec:1 ] , we present the experimental set - up and the results of the magneto - transport measurements ( sec . 
 [ sec:1.1 ] ) under hydrostatic pressure . 
 the subsection [ sec:1.2 ] is devoted to a discussion of the temperature dependence of the carrier densities , in comparison with the model of ( a ) massless dirac fermions and ( b ) massive carriers . 
 furthermore thermopower measurements are presented to corroborate the two - carrier scenario . 
 the measured temperature dependence of the extracted carrier mobilities is exposed in sec . 
 [ sec:1.3 ] , and a theoretical discussion of the experimental results , in terms of short - range ( such as screened coulomb ) scatterers may be found in sec . 
 [ sec:2 ] . 
 we present our conclusions and future perspectives in sec . 
 [ sec:3 ] . 
 the single crystals of ai3 used in our study have been synthesized by electro - crystallization . 
 their typical size is @xmath4 mm@xmath5 ( @xmath6 plane ) x @xmath7 m ( @xmath8 direction ) . 
 six @xmath9 nm thick gold contacts were deposited by joule evaporation on both sides of the sample , allowing for simultaneous longitudinal and transverse resistivity measurements . 
 a picture of one of the three samples studied is shown in the inset of figure [ magneto ] . 
 the resistivities were measured using a low - frequency ac lock - in technique . 
 the magnetic field @xmath10 , oriented along the @xmath8 axis , was swept between @xmath11 and @xmath12 t at constant temperature between @xmath13 and @xmath3 k. to account for alignment mismatch of patterned contacts , the longitudinal ( transverse ) resistivity has been symmetrized ( anti - symmetrized ) with respect to the orientation of @xmath10 to obtain even [ @xmath14 and odd [ @xmath15 functions respectively . 
 hydrostatic pressure was applied at room temperature in a nicral clamp cell using daphne 7373 silicone oil as the pressure transmitting medium . 
 the pressure was determined , at room temperature , using a manganine resistance gauge located in the pressure cell close to the sample . 
 the values given below take into account the pressure decrease during cooling . 
 the analysis of our data is based on the study of the magneto - conductivity and is similar to the one presented in ref . for multi - carrier semiconductor systems . 
 the magneto - conductivity is obtained from the measured resistivity tensor by means of @xmath16 $ ] . for a single carrier system , its analytical expression reads@xcite @xmath17 where @xmath18 , @xmath19 is the electron charge , @xmath20 the mobility , and @xmath21 is the carrier density . 
 figure [ magneto ] displays a typical magneto - conductivity curve of ai3 under pressure , where two ` plateaus ' can be clearly seen . as conductivity in ai3 
 has a strong 2d character , conductivity is shown both as 3d conductivity ( @xmath22 ) and as 2d conductivity ( @xmath23 of each bedt - ttf plane ) according to @xmath24 . 
 as conductivity is additive , in a two - carrier system , the contributions of each carrier type a and b can be added , @xmath25    the two `` plateaus '' , observed in fig . 
 [ magneto ] , indicate the existence of two different carrier types ( @xmath26 or @xmath27 ) with significantly different mobilities . from this curve 
 , we can extract the mobilities , @xmath28 , of each carrier type , their zero - field conductivities , @xmath29 , and their carrier densities , @xmath30 , by @xmath31 . 
 regime at high fields . 
 the left axis shows the square ( 2d ) conductivity of each bedt - ttf plane while the right axis shows the `` bulk '' ( 3d ) longitudinal conductivity ( see text ) . 
 inset : photograph of one sample . ] 
 figure [ sigmaxxt ] shows magneto - conductivity curves of ai3 at a fixed pressure for several temperatures . 
 the previous analysis has been repeated for each of these magneto - conductivity curves to obtain the densities ( fig . 
 [ density ] ) and mobilities ( fig . [ mobility ] ) for each carrier type as a function of temperature and for three different pressures , @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 gpa . 
 the strong temperature dependence of the carrier density is a signature that temperature is higher than @xmath35 for both a and b carriers even at the lowest measured temperature , @xmath36 k. this low fermi temperature hints at the absence of charge inhomogeneities that prevent the approach of the dirac point in graphene on si0@xmath37 substrates.@xcite      the carrier density can be calculated from @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is the fermi - dirac distribution and @xmath40 is the density of states for massive ( @xmath41 ) and dirac ( @xmath42 ) carriers:@xcite     gpa for different temperatures , from bottom to top : @xmath3 , @xmath43 , @xmath34 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 k. the left axis shows the square ( 2d ) conductivity of each bedt - ttf plane while the right axis shows the `` bulk '' ( 3d ) longitudinal conductivity . ]

 the continuous lines represent power laws fits for the mobilities dependences with temperature , which gives exponents @xmath55 ( a carriers ) and @xmath56 ( b carriers ) . 
 the low temperature dispersion of a carriers mobility is due to a decrease of the saturating mobility ( dotted line ) by increasing pressure . ] 
 @xmath57    @xmath58    where @xmath59 and @xmath60 are valley and spin degeneracies and @xmath61 is the effective mass of massive carriers described by a schrdinger equation . in ai3 under pressure , 
 two dirac cones but only one massive band exist at the fermi level.@xcite for large temperatures , @xmath62 , the carrier density depends linearly on temperature for massive carriers and quadratically for dirac carriers :    @xmath63    @xmath64    figure [ density ] represents the measured temperature dependence of the mobilities and reveals a power - law behavior , @xmath65 . 
 indeed one obtains an exponent of @xmath66 for the low - mobility carriers ( b ) , in good agreement with what [ eq . 
 ( [ nmassif ] ) ] expected for massive carriers , whereas one finds @xmath67 for the high - mobility carriers ( a ) , as roughly expected for massless dirac particles [ eq . ( [ ndirac ] ) ] . 
 besides , the nature of the carriers can be extracted from hall measurements . 
 furthermore , we have performed thermopower measurements under pressure on a second sample ( figure [ thermopower ] ) . 
 these data show a sign change for the seebeck coefficient ( s ) around 5k . 
 thermopower is the voltage per unit of temperature produced by a thermal gradient . 
 the carrier type determines the sign while the density and mobility of the carriers establish the amplitude . 
 thus , a sign change of the thermopower indicates that the relevant carriers at low temperature have a different charge than those at high temperature , requiring a two - carrier scenario .        in agreement with ref . 
 , a carriers which dominate the low - field conduction are electrons . on the contrary , at large fields 
 the conduction is dominated by holes ( b carriers ) . 
 notice that our results are consistent with ab - initio calculations of the band structure of ai3 under a pressure of @xmath68 gpa ( inset of figure [ density])@xcite and do not depend on pressure ( within the range @xmath69 gpa ) . 
 this supports the idea that massless and massive particles coexist in a broad pressure range 
 . however , since @xmath70 in the whole temperature range under study , both dirac electrons and dirac holes are excited . 
 thus there are indeed not two but three carrier types : dirac holes , dirac electrons and massive electrons . for @xmath62 , 
 the electron and hole densities are actually identical ( semimetal with symmetric band structure ) : @xmath71 . 
 the absence of a third ` plateau ' in the magneto - conductivity data allows us to consider that dirac electrons and holes have roughly the same mobilities : @xmath72 . 
 therefore , the results obtained in figure [ density ] and [ mobility ] still hold when we consider two types of dirac carriers ( electrons and holes ) in addition to the massive holes . 
 this analysis allows us to avoid using hall effect measurements for the determination of carrier densities . indeed , hall effect interpretation becomes challenging as dirac electron and hole contributions partially compensate , leading to the determination of only an ` effective ' dirac carrier density , and they are both mixed with massive carriers contribution . 
 this problem is solved here by analyzing the magneto - conductivity where all carriers contributions are additive . 
 the effective mass of the massive carriers has been extracted from eq . 
 ( [ nmassif ] ) . 
 the obtained value is quite small @xmath73 ( @xmath74 is the free electron mass ) . 
 meanwhile , from eq . 
 ( [ ndirac ] ) , @xmath75 m / s can be extracted , in agreement with previous theoretica@xcite and experimental estimates.@xcite in fig . [ density ] , no significant variation of this argument is observed upon sweeping pressure ( which should appear as a vertical shift of the @xmath76 line ) . 
 this indicates that @xmath77 does not change with pressure . in principle 
 , pressure should enhance hopping while reducing the unit cell volume . 
 thus , an enhancement of the @xmath77 with pressure could be expected according to the approximate expression @xmath78 , where @xmath79 is the hopping integral . 
 this expression can be simplified by means of harrison s law ( @xmath80 ) into @xmath81 . as pressure slightly modifies the lattice constant ( @xmath82gpa @xcite ) 
 , @xmath77 is expected to vary by the same order of magnitude which is smaller than our current experimental uncertainty . 
 this accounts for the apparent absence of pressure effects on the carrier density in the range @xmath83 gpa .    in fig . 
 [ mobility ] , the mobility of the dirac carriers ( a ) reaches @xmath84 cm@xmath5/vs at low temperatures ( @xmath86 k ) , a value comparable to already published values.@xcite it is quite high compared to typical graphene on 2 values ( @xmath87 to @xmath88 cm@xmath5/vs ) but similar to suspended graphene and graphene on bn mobilities at very low carrier density.@xcite on the other hand , the mobility for massive carriers is @xmath89 cm@xmath5/vs at @xmath86 k , which is two orders of magnitude smaller than for dirac carriers . 
 the temperature dependence of the mobility follows power laws for both massive ( exponent @xmath56 ) and dirac carriers ( exponent @xmath55 ) . 
 moreover , the dirac carrier mobility seems to saturate at @xmath90 . 
 a similar saturation has been reported in others dirac systems.@xcite table [ tabcomp ] summarizes the main parameters of massive and dirac carriers in ai3 , in comparison with graphene on 2 . 
 .dirac and massive carriers parameters in ai3 at high pressure , in comparison with graphene electrons . [ cols=""<,<,<,<"",options=""header "" , ] 
 in order to better understand the difference in the mobility , we investigate the ratio @xmath91 , in terms of the scattering times @xmath92 and @xmath93 for the massless dirac and massive carriers , respectively . 
 furthermore , @xmath94 is the density - dependent cyclotron mass of the dirac carriers , in terms of the fermi energy @xmath95 . 
 the scattering times may be obtained from fermi s golden rule ( for @xmath96 ) @xmath97 in terms of the impurity density @xmath98 , the matrix element @xmath99 , and the density of states ( [ ddirac ] ) for dirac and ( [ dmassif ] ) for massive carriers . 
 we consider implicitly that both carrier types are affected by the same impurities , and the matrix element is independent of @xmath100 for short - range impurity scattering . 
 apart from atomic defects , screened coulomb - type impurities approximately fulfill this condition , as it may be seen within the thomas - fermi ( tf ) approximation . 
 indeed , the screening length of the coulomb interaction is dominated by the thomas - fermi wave vector @xmath101 m@xmath102 of the massive carriers , for an effective bohr radius @xmath103 , whereas the thomas - fermi wave vector for massless dirac carriers @xmath104 m@xmath102 , for a density @xmath105 cm@xmath102 and a fine - structure constant @xmath107 . 
 the thomas - fermi wave vector is thus roughly one order of magnitude larger than the fermi wave vector of the massive carriers , which is itself much larger than that of the dirac carriers . 
 the screened coulomb potential for @xmath100-type carriers may therefore be approximated by its @xmath108 value , @xmath109 , which is thus the same for both carrier types , as mentioned above . 
 here , @xmath110 is the permittivity of the dielectric environment and @xmath111 is the dielectric function calculated within the thomas - fermi approximation .    in view of the above considerations , we thus obtain , for the mobility ratio in the limit @xmath112 @xmath113 which does neither depend on the form of the matrix element nor on the impurity density . 
 one expects a ratio in the @xmath114 range , whereas the measured ratio is @xmath115 at @xmath116 k. notice that for @xmath62 , that is in the experimentally relevant regime here , one may replace the energy dependence in the density of states of the massless dirac carriers by a linear dependence in temperature , @xmath117 , such that one expects a linear temperature dependence of the mobility ratio ( [ eq : mu ] ) , in agreement with our experimental findings ( @xmath118 for @xmath119 , see fig . [ mobility ] ) . 
 to conclude , we present an interpretation of magneto - transport in ai3 that indicates that both massive and dirac carriers are present even at high pressures . thermopower measurements performed on one of the three studied samples are also in agreement with this two carrier scenario . 
 so far in the literature , the conduction in this system has been attributed solely to dirac carriers.@xcite moreover , this coexistence holds with little perturbation in the whole range of pressure under study . as dirac carriers have high mobility , they dominate the conduction at low magnetic field and high temperatures . on the contrary , for high magnetic fields and low temperatures , 
 the massive holes drive the conduction properties . 
 this crossover can be clearly seen from our magneto - conductivity curves and is responsible for their peculiar ` plateau ' shape . 
 it should also be noted that a proper separation of massive carriers has to be done prior to using any expression that concerns solely dirac carriers . in order to confirm the picture of coexisting dirac and massive carriers , complementary studies , such as spectroscopic measurements , 
 are highly desirable but beyond the scope of the present paper .

 the carrier types , densities and mobilities are determined from the magneto - conductance of 3 . 
 while evidence of high - mobility massless dirac carriers has already been given , we report here , their coexistence with low - mobility massive holes . 
 this coexistence seems robust as it has been found up to the highest studied pressure . 
 our results are in agreement with recent dft calculations of the band structure of this system under hydrostatic pressure .

 the device independent security proof is very interesting from the theoretical viewpoint , however it can not apply to practical qkd systems where loopholes in testing bell s inequality @xcite can not be closed . as for the experimental counter - measures , 
 battle - testing of the practical detection unit has attracted many researchers attention @xcite since the most successful practical attack so far is to exploit the imperfections of the detectors . 
 recently , a very simple and very promising idea , which is called a measurement device independent qkd ( mdiqkd ) has been proposed by lo , curty , and qi @xcite . in this scheme 
 , neither alice nor bob performs any measurement , but they only send out quantum signals to a measurement unit ( mu ) . 
 mu is a willing participant of the protocol , and mu can be a network administrator or a relay . 
 however , mu can be untrusted and completely under the control of the eavesdropper ( eve ) . 
 after alice and bob send out signals , they wait for mu s announcement of whether she has obtained the successful detection , and proceed to the standard post - processing of their sifted data , such as error rate estimation , error correction , and privacy amplification . 
 the basic idea of mdiqkd is based on a reversed epr - based qkd protocol @xcite , which is equivalent to epr - based qkd @xcite in the sense of the security , and mdiqkd is remarkable because it removes _ all _ the potential loopholes of the detectors without sacrificing the performance of standard qkd since alice and bob do not detect any quantum signals from eve . moreover , it is shown in @xcite that mdiqkd with infinite number of decoy states and polarization encoding can cover about twice the distance of standard decoyed qkd , which is comparable to epr - based qkd . 
 the only assumption needed in mdiqkd is that the preparation of the quantum signal sources by alice and bob is ( almost ) perfect and carefully characterized . 
 we remark that the characterization of the signal source should be easier than that of the detection unit since the characterization of the detection unit involves the estimation of the response of the devices to unknown input signals sent from eve . 
 with mdiqkd in our hand , we do not need to worry about imperfections of mu any more , and we should focus our attention more to the imperfections of signal sources . 
 one of the important imperfections of the sources is the basis - dependent flaw that stems from the discrepancy of the density matrices corresponding to the two bases in bb84 states . 
 the security of standard bb84 with basis - dependent flaw has been analyzed in @xcite which show that the basis - dependent flaw decreases the achievable distance . 
 thus , in order to investigate the practicality of mdiqkd , we need to generalize the above works to investigate the security of mdiqkd under the imperfection . 
 another problem in mdiqkd is that the first proposal is based on polarization encoding @xcite , however , in some situations where birefringence effect in optical fiber is highly time - dependent , we need to consider mdiqkd with phase encoding rather than polarization encoding . in this paper , we study the above issues simultaneously . 
 we first propose two schemes of the phase encoding mdiqkd , one employs phase locking of two separate laser sources and the other one uses the conversion of phase encoding into polarization encoding . 
 then , we prove the unconditional security of these schemes with basis - dependent flaw by generalizing the quantum coin idea @xcite . based on the security proof , we simulate the key generation rate with realistic parameters , especially we employ a simple model to evaluate the basis - dependent flaw due to the imperfection of the phase modulators . 
 our simulation results imply that the first scheme covers shorter distances and may require less accuracy of the state preparation , while the second scheme can cover much longer distances when we can prepare the state very precisely . 
 we note that in this paper we consider the most general type of attacks allowed by quantum mechanics and establish unconditional security for our protocols . 
 this paper is organized as follows . in sec . 
 [ sec : protocol ] , we give a generic description of mdiqkd protocol , and we propose our schemes in sec . [ sec : phase encoding scheme i ] and sec . 
 [ sec : phase encoding scheme ii ] . 
 then , we prove the unconditional security of our schemes in sec . [ sec : proof ] , and we present some simulation results of the key generation rate based on realistic parameters in sec . [ sec : simulation ] . finally , we summarize this paper in sec . [ 
 sec : summary ] . 
 in this section , we introduce mdiqkd protocol whose description is generic for all the schemes that we will introduce in the following sections . the mdiqkd protocol runs as follows . 
 step ( 1 ) : each of alice and bob prepares a signal pulse and a reference pulse , and each of alice and bob applies phase modulation to the signal pulse , which is randomly chosen from @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 . here , @xmath4 ( @xmath5 ) defines @xmath6 ( @xmath7)-basis . 
 alice and bob send both pulses through quantum channels to eve who possesses mu . 
 step ( 2 ) : mu performs some measurement , and announces whether the measurement outcome is successful or not . 
 it also broadcasts whether the successful event is the detection of type-0 or type-1 ( the two types of the successful outcomes correspond to two specific bell states @xcite ) . 
 step ( 3 ) : if the measurement outcome is successful , then alice and bob keep their data . 
 otherwise , they discard the data . 
 when the outcome is successful , alice and bob broadcast their bases and they keep the data only when the bases match , which we call sifted key . depending on the type of the successful event and the basis that they used , bob may or may not perform bit - flip on his sifted key . 
 step ( 4 ) : alice and bob repeat ( 1)-(3 ) many times until they have large enough number of the sifted key . 
 step ( 5 ) : they sacrifice a portion of the data as the test bits to estimate the bit error rate and the phase error rate on the remaining data ( code bits ) . 
 step ( 6 ) : if the estimated bit error and phase error rates are too high , then they abort the protocol , otherwise they proceed . 
 step ( 7 ) : alice and bob agree over a public channel on an error correcting code and on a hash function depending on the bit and phase error rate on the code bits . after performing error correction and privacy amplification , they share the key . 
 the role of the mu in eve is to establish a quantum correlation , i.e. , a bell state , between alice and bob to generate the key . 
 if it can establish the strong correlation , then alice and bob can generate the key , and if it can not , then it only results in a high bit error rate to be detected by alice and bob and they abort the protocol . as we will see later , since alice and bob can judge whether they can generate a key or not by only checking the experimental data as well as information on the fidelity between the density matrices in @xmath6- basis and @xmath7-basis , it does not matter who performs the measurement nor what kind of measurement is actually done as long as mu broadcasts whether the measurement outcome was successful together with the information of whether the successful outcome is type-0 or type-1 .    in the security proof 
 , we assume that mu is totally under the control of eve . in practice , however , we should choose an appropriate measurement that establishes the strong correlation under the normal operation , i.e. , the situation without eve who induces the channel losses and noises . in the following sections , we will propose two phase encoding mdiqkd schemes . 
 in this section , we propose an experimental setup for mdiqkd with phase encoding scheme , which is depicted in fig . 
 [ setup1 ] . 
 this scheme will be proven to be unconditionally secure , i.e. , secure against the most general type of attacks allowed by quantum mechanics . in this setup , we assume that the intensity of alice s signal ( reference ) pulse matches with that of bob s signal ( reference ) pulse when they enter mu . in order to lock the relative phase , we use strong pulses as the reference pulses . in pl unit in the figure , the relative phase between the two strong pulses is measured in two polarization modes separately . the measurement result is denoted by @xmath8 ( here , the arrow represents two entries that correspond to the two relative phases ) . depending on this information @xmath8 , appropriate phase modulations for two polarization modes 
 are applied to incoming signal pulse from alice . 
 then , alice s and bob s signal pulses are input into the 50/50 beam splitter which is followed by two single - photon threshold detectors . 
 the successful event of type-0 ( type-1 ) in step ( 2 ) is defined as the event where only d0 ( d1 ) clicks . in the case of type-1 successful detection event 
 , bob applies bit flip to his sifted key ( we define the phase relationship of bs in such a way that d1 never clicks when the phases of the two input signal coherent pulses are the same ) .    . 
 then , the phase shift of @xmath8 for each polarization mode is applied to one of the signal pulses , and they will be detected by d0 and d1 after the interference at the 50:50 beam splitter bs . 
 [ setup1 ] ]    roughly speaking , our scheme performs double bb84 @xcite , i.e. , each of alice and bob is sending signals in the bb84 states , without phase randomization @xcite . 
 differences between our scheme and the polarization encoding mdiqkd scheme include that alice and bob do not need to share the reference frame for the polarization mode , since mu performs the feed - forward control of the polarization , and our scheme intrinsically possesses the basis - dependent flaw . 
 to see how this particular setup establishes the quantum correlation under the normal operation , it is convenient to consider an entanglement distribution scheme @xcite , which is mathematically equivalent to the actual protocol . for the simplicity of the discussion 
 , we assume the perfect phase locking for the moment and we only consider the case where both of alice and bob use @xmath6-basis . 
 we skip the discussion for @xmath7-basis , however it holds in a similar manner @xcite . in this case , the actual protocol is equivalently described as follows . 
 first , alice prepares two systems in the following state , which is a purification of the @xmath6-basis density matrix , @xmath9 and sends the second system to mu through the quantum channel . 
 here , @xmath10 and @xmath11 represent coherent states that alice prepares in the actual protocol ( @xmath12 represents the mean photon number or inetensity ) , @xmath13 and @xmath14 are eigenstate of the computational basis ( @xmath6 basis ) , which is related with @xmath7-basis eigenstate through @xmath15 and @xmath16 . for the later convenience , 
 we also define @xmath17-basis states as @xmath18 and @xmath19 . 
 moreover , the subscript of @xmath20 in @xmath21 represents that alice is to measure her qubit along @xmath6-basis , the subscript of @xmath22 in @xmath12 refers to the party who prepares the system , and the superscript @xmath23 represents the relative phase of the superposition . 
 similarly , bob also prepares two systems in a similar state @xmath24 , sends the second system to mu , and performs @xmath6-basis measurement . note that @xmath6-basis measurement by alice and bob can be delayed after eve s announcement of the successful event without losing any generalities in the security analysis , and we assume this delay in what follows . 
 in order to see the joint state of the qubit pair after the announcement , note that the beam splitter converts the joint state @xmath25 into the following state @xmath26 @xmath27 here , for the simplicity of the discussion , we assume that there is no channel losses , we define @xmath28 , and @xmath29 represents the vacuum state . 
 moreover , the subscripts @xmath30 and @xmath31 represent the output ports of the beam splitter . if detector d0 
 ( d1 ) detects photons and the other detector d1 ( d0 ) detects the vacuum state , i.e. , type-0 ( type-1 ) event , it is shown in the appendix a that the joint probability of having type-0 ( type-1 ) successful event and alice and bob share the maximally entangled state @xmath32 ( @xmath33 ) is @xmath34 . 
 we note that since @xmath35 , alice and bob do not always share this state , and with a joint probability of @xmath36 , they have type-0 ( type-1 ) successful event and share the maximally entangled state with the phase error , i.e. , the bit error in @xmath7-basis , as @xmath37 ( @xmath38 ) . 
 note that the bit - flip operation in type-1 successful detection can be equivalently performed by @xmath2 rotation around @xmath17-basis before bob performs @xmath6 basis measurement . 
 in other words , @xmath2 rotation around @xmath17-basis before @xmath6-basis measurement does not change the statistics of the @xmath6-basis measurement followed by the bit - flip . 
 thanks to this property , we can conclude that alice and bob share @xmath32 with probability of @xmath39 and @xmath37 with probability of @xmath40 after the rotation . 
 this means that even if alice and bob are given the successful detection event , they can not be sure whether they share @xmath37 or @xmath32 , however , if they choose a small enough @xmath41 , then the phase error rate ( the rate of the state @xmath37 in the qubit pairs remaining after the successful events or equivalently , the rate of @xmath7-basis bit error among all the shared qubit pairs ) becomes small and they can generate a pure state @xmath32 by phase error correction , which is equivalently done by privacy amplification in the actual protocol @xcite . 
 we note that the above discussion is valid only for the case without noises and losses , and we will prove the security against the most general attack in sec . 
 [ sec : proof ] without relying on the argument given in this section . 
 we remark that in the phase encoding scheme i , it is important that alice and bob know quite well about the four states that they prepare . 
 this may be accomplished by using state tomography with homodyne measurement involving the use of the strong reference pulse @xcite . 
 [ scheme ii ]            in this section , we propose the second experimental setup for mdiqkd with phase encoding scheme . 
 like scheme i , this scheme will also be proven to be unconditionally secure . in this scheme , the coherent pulses that alice and bob 
 send out are exactly the same as those in the standard phase encoding bb84 , i.e. , @xmath42 where subscripts @xmath43 and @xmath44 respectively denote the signal pulse and the reference pulse , @xmath45 is a completely random phase , @xmath46 is randomly chosen from @xmath47 to encode the information . after entering the mu , 
 each pulse pair is converted from a phase coding signal to a polarization coding signal by a phase - to - polarization converter ( see details below ) . 
 we note that thanks to the phase randomization by @xmath45 , the joint state of the signal pulse and the reference pulse is a classical mixture of photon number states .    in fig . 
 [ setup2 ] , we show the schematics of the converter . this converter performs the phase - to - polarization conversion : @xmath48 to @xmath49 , where @xmath50 is a projector that projects the joint system of the signal and reference pulses to a two - dimensional single - photon subspace spanned by @xmath51 where @xmath0 and @xmath52 represent the photon number , and @xmath53 ( @xmath54 ) represents the horizontal ( vertical ) polarization state of a single - photon . to see how it works , 
 let us follow the time evolution of the input state . 
 at the polarization beam splitter ( pbs in fig . 
 [ setup2 ] ) , the signal and reference pulses first split into two polarization modes , h and v , and we throw away the pulses being routed to v mode . 
 then , in h mode , the signal pulse and the reference pulse are routed to different paths by using an optical switch , and we apply @xmath2-rotation only to one of the paths to convert h to v. at this point , we essentially have @xmath55 , where the subscripts of `` @xmath56 '' and `` @xmath57 '' respectively denote the upper path and the lower path . 
 finally , these spatial modes @xmath56 and @xmath57 are combined together by using a polarization beam splitter so that we have @xmath49 in the output port depicted as `` out '' .    in practice , since the birefringence of the quantum channel can be highly time dependent and the polarization state of the input pulses to mu may randomly change with time , i.e. , the input polarization state is a completely mixed state , we can not deterministically distill a pure polarization state , and thus the conversion efficiency can never be perfect . 
 in other words , one may consider the same conversion of the v mode just after the first polarization beam splitter , however it is impossible to combine the resulting polarization pulses from v mode and the one from h mode into a single mode . 
 we assume that mu has two converters , one is for the conversion of alice s pulse and the other one is for bob s pulse , and the two output ports `` out '' are connected to exactly the same bell measurement unit @xcite in the polarization encoding mdiqkd scheme in fig . 
 [ bell m ] @xcite . 
 this bell measurement unit consists of a 50:50 beam splitter , two polarization beam splitters , and four single - photon detectors , which only distinguishes perfectly two out of the four bell states of @xmath38 and @xmath33 . 
 the polarization beam splitters discriminate between @xmath58 and @xmath59 ( note that we choose @xmath60 and @xmath61 modes rather than h and v modes since our computational basis is @xmath60 and @xmath61 ) . 
 suppose that a single - photon enters both from alice and bob . in this case 
 , the click of d0 + and d0- or d1 + and d1- means the detection of @xmath38 , and the click of d0 + and d1- or d0- and d1 + means the detection of @xmath33 ( see fig . 
 [ bell m ] ) . in this scheme , since the use of coherent light induces non - zero bit error rate in @xmath7-basis ( @xmath62-basis ) , we consider to generate the key from @xmath63-basis and we use the data in @xmath7-basis only to estimate the bit error rate in this basis conditioned on that both of alice and bob emit a single - photon , which determines the amount of privacy amplification . by considering a single - photon polarization input both from alice and bob , one can see that bob should not apply the bit flip only when alice and bob use @xmath7-basis and @xmath64 is detected in mu , and bob should apply the bit flip in all the other successful events to share the same bit value . 
 accordingly , the bit error in @xmath6-basis is given by the successful detection event conditioned on that alice and bob s polarization are identical . 
 as for @xmath7-basis , the bit error is @xmath64 detection given the orthogonal polarizations or @xmath65 detection given the identical polarization . 
 assuming completely random input polarization state , our converter successfully converts the single - photon pulse with a probability of @xmath66 . 
 note in the normal experiment that the birefringence effect between alice and the converter and the one between bob and the converter are random and independent , however it only leads to fluctuating coincidence rate of alice s and bob s signals at the bell measurement , but does not affect the qber . 
 moreover , the fluctuation increases the single - photon loss inserted into the bell measurement . 
 especially , the events that the output of the converter for alice is the vacuum and the one for bob is a single - photon , and vice versa would increase compared to the case where we have no birefringence effect . 
 however , this is not a problem since the bell measurement does not output the conclusive events in these cases unless the dark counting occurs . 
 thus , the random and independent polarization fluctuation in the normal experiment is not a problem , and we will simply assume in our simulation in sec . 
 [ simulationii ] that this fluctuation can be modeled just by @xmath66 loss . 
 we emphasize that we do not rely on these assumptions at all when we prove the security , and our security proof applies to any channels and mus .    for the better performance and also for the simplicity of analysis , we assume the use of infinite number of decoy states @xcite to estimate the fraction of the probability of successful event conditioned on that both of alice and bob emit a single - photon . 
 one of the differences in our analysis from the work in @xcite is that we will take into account the imperfection of alice s and bob s source , i.e. , the decay of the fidelity between two density matrices in two bases . 
 we also remark that since the h and v modes are defined locally in mu , alice and bob do not need to share the reference frame for the polarization mode , which is one of the qualitative differences from polarization encoding miqkd scheme @xcite . 
 this section is devoted to the unconditional security proof , i.e. , the security proof against the most general attacks , of our schemes . 
 since both of our schemes are based on bb84 and the basis - dependent flaw in both protocols can be treated in the same manner , we can prove the security in a unified manner . 
 if the states sent by alice and bob were basis independent , i.e. , the density matrices of @xmath6-basis and @xmath7-basis were the same , then the security proof of the original bb84 @xcite could directly apply ( also see @xcite for a bit more detailed discussion of this proof ) , however they are basis dependent in our case . 
 fortunately , security proof of standard bb84 with basis - dependent flaw has already been shown to be secure @xcite , and we generalize this idea to our case where we have basis - dependent flaw from both of alice and bob . in order to do so , we consider a virtual protocol @xcite that alice and bob get together and the basis choices by alice and bob are made via measurement processes on the so - called quantum coin . in this virtual protocol of the phase encoding scheme i , 
 alice and bob prepare joint systems in the state @xcite @xmath67 since just replacing the state , for instance @xmath68 where @xmath52 and @xmath0 in the ket respectively represents the single - photon and the vacuum , is enough to apply the following proof to the phase encoding scheme ii , we discuss only the security of the phase encoding scheme i in what follows . in eq . 
 ( [ coin - joint - state ] ) , the first system denoted by @xmath69 is given to eve just after the preparation , and it informs eve of whether the bases to be used by alice and bob match or not . 
 the second system , denoted by @xmath70 , is a copy of the first system and this system is given to bob who measures this system with @xmath71 basis to know whether alice s and bob s bases match or not . if his measurement outcome is @xmath72 ( @xmath73 ) , then he uses the same ( the other ) basis to be used by alice ( note that no classical communication is needed in order for bob to know alice s basis since alice and bob get together ) . 
 the third system , which is denoted by @xmath22 and we call `` quantum coin '' , is possessed and to be measured by alice along @xmath74 basis to determine her basis choice , and the measurement outcome will be sent to eve after eve broadcasts the measurement outcome at mu . moreover , 
 all the second systems of @xmath75 , @xmath76 , @xmath24 , and @xmath77 are sent to eve . 
 note in this formalism that the information , including classical information and quantum information , available to eve is the same as those in the actual protocol , and the generated key is also the same as the one of the actual protocol since the statistics of alice s and bob s raw data is exactly the same as the one of the actual protocol . 
 thus , we are allowed to work on this virtual protocol for the security proof .    the first system given to eve in eq . 
 ( [ coin - joint - state ] ) allows her to know which coherent pulses contain data in the sifted key and she can post - select only the relevant pulses . 
 thus , without the loss of any generalities of the security proof , we can concentrate only on the post - selected version of the state in eq . 
 ( [ coin - joint - state ] ) as @xmath78    the most important quantity in the proof is the phase error rate in the code bits . the definition of the phase error rate is the rate of bit errors along @xmath7-basis in the sifted key if they had chosen @xmath7-basis as the measurement basis when both of them have sent pulses in @xmath6-basis . if alice and bob have a good estimation of this rate as well as the bit error rate in the sifted key ( the bit error rate in @xmath6-basis given alice and bob have chosen @xmath6-basis for the state preparation ) , they can perform hashing in @xmath7-basis and @xmath6-basis simultaneously @xcite to distill pairs of qubits in the state whose fidelity with respect to the product state of the maximally entangled state @xmath32 is close to @xmath52 .    according to the discussion on the universal composability @xcite , the key distilled via @xmath6-basis measurement on such a state 
 is composably secure and moreover exactly the same key can be generated only by classical means , i.e. , error correction and privacy amplification @xcite . 
 thus , we are left only with the phase error estimation . for the simplicity of the discussion , we assume the large number of successful events @xmath79 so that we neglect all the statistical fluctuations and we are allowed to work on a probability rather than the relative frequency .    the quantity we have to estimate is the bit error along @xmath7-basis , denoted by @xmath80 , given alice and bob send @xmath81 state , which is different from the experimentally available bit error rate along @xmath7-basis given alice and bob send @xmath82 state . 
 intuitively , if the basis - dependent flaw is very small , @xmath80 and @xmath83 should be very close since the states are almost indistinguishable . to make this intuition rigorous 
 , we briefly review the idea by @xcite which applies bloch sphere bound @xcite to the quantum coin . 
 suppose that we randomly choose @xmath17-basis or @xmath6-basis as the measurement basis for each quantum coin . 
 let @xmath84 and @xmath85 be fraction that those quantum coins result in @xmath52 in @xmath17-basis and @xmath6-basis measurement , respectively . what bloch sphere bound , i.e. , eq . 
 ( 13 ) or eq . 
 ( 14 ) in @xcite or eq . 
 ( a1 ) in @xcite , tells us in our case is that no matter how the correlations among the quantum coins are and no matter what the state for the quantum coins is , thanks to the randomly chosen bases , the following inequality holds with probability exponentially close to @xmath52 in @xmath79 , @xmath86 by applying this bound separately to the quantum coins that are conditional on having phase errors and to those that are conditional on having no phase error , and furthermore by combining those inequalities using bayes s rule , we have @xmath87 here , @xmath88 is equivalent to the probability that the measurement outcome of the quantum coin along @xmath6-basis is @xmath14 given the successful event in mu . 
 note that this probability can be enhanced by eve who chooses carefully the pulses , and eve could attribute all the loss events to the quantum coins being in the state @xmath13 . 
 thus , we have an upper bound of @xmath88 in the worst case scenario as @xmath89 and @xmath90 where @xmath91 is the frequency of the successful event . 
 note that we have not used the explicit form of @xmath92 and @xmath93 , where @xmath94 , in the derivation of eqs . 
 ( [ phase error bound ] ) , ( [ fdelta ] ) , and ( [ delta ] ) , and the important point is that the state @xmath92 and @xmath93 are the purification of alice s and bob s density matrices for both bases . 
 since there always exists purification states of @xmath95 and @xmath96 , which are respectively denoted by @xmath97 and @xmath98 , such that @xmath99 , @xmath100 can be rewritten by @xmath101/2\ , , \label{fiddelta}\end{aligned}\ ] ] where @xmath102 represents alice s density matrix of @xmath6 basis and all the other density matrices are defined by the same manner . 
 our expression of @xmath100 has the product of two fidelities , while the standard bb84 with basis - dependent flaw in @xcite has only one fidelity ( the fidelity between alice s density matrices in @xmath6 and @xmath7 bases ) . 
 the two products may lead to poor performance of our schemes compared to that of standard qkd in terms of the achievable distances , however our schemes have the huge advantage over the standard qkd that there is no side - channel in the detectors . 
 finally , the key generation rate @xmath103 , given @xmath6-basis , in the asymptotic limit of large @xmath79 is given by @xmath104 where @xmath105 is the bit error rate in @xmath6-basis , @xmath106 is the inefficiency of the error correcting code , and @xmath107 . 
 we can trivially obtain the key generation rate for @xmath7-basis just by interchanging @xmath6-basis in all the discussions above to @xmath7-basis . 
 we remark in our security proof that we have assumed nothing about what kind of measurement mu conducts but that it announces whether it detects the successful event and the type of the event ( this announcement allows us to calculate @xmath108 and the error rates ) . 
 thus , mu can be assumed to be totally under the control of eve . 
 in the following subsections , we show some examples of the key generation rate of each of our schemes assuming typical experimental parameters taken from gobby - yuan - shields ( gys ) experiment @xcite unless otherwise stated . 
 moreover , we assume that the imperfect phase modulation is the main source of the decay of the fidelity between the density matrices in two bases , and we evaluate the effect of this imperfection on the key generation rate .      in the phase encoding scheme 
 i , the important quantity for the security @xmath100 can be expressed as @xmath109\ , .

 see also the main text for the explanation . 
 [ fig : key33 ] ]    ) that outputs fig . 
 [ fig : key33 ] as a function of the distance between alice and bob . 
 [ fig : intensity33 ] ]    to simulate the resulting key generation rate , we assume that the bit error stems from the dark counting as well as alignment errors due to imperfect phase locking or imperfect optical components . the alignment error is assumed to be proportional to the probability of having a correct click caused only by the optical detection not by the dark counting . 
 moreover , we make assumptions that all the detectors have the same characteristics for the simplicity of the analysis , and alice and bob choose the intensities of the signal lights in such a way that the intensities of the incoming pulses to mu are the same . finally , we assume the quantum inefficiency of the detectors to be part of the losses in the quantum channels . 
 with all the assumptions , we may express the resulting experimental parameters as @xmath114(1-p_{\rm dark})\nonumber\\ & + & ( 1-p_{\rm dark})e^{-2\alpha_{\rm in}}p_{\rm dark}\nonumber\\ \gamma_{\rm suc}&=&\gamma_{\rm suc}^{(x)}+\gamma_{\rm suc}^{(y)}\nonumber\\ \delta_x&=&\delta_y=\big[e_{\rm ali}(1-p_{\rm dark})^2(1-e^{-2\alpha_{\rm in}})\nonumber\\ & + & ( 1-p_{\rm dark})e^{-2\alpha_{\rm in}}p_{\rm dark}\big]/\gamma_{\rm suc}^{(x)}\nonumber\\ \alpha_{\rm in}&\equiv&\alpha_{a}\eta_{a}=\alpha_{b}\eta_{b}\nonumber\\ \eta_{a}&=&\eta_{{\rm det } , a}10^{-\xi_{a } l_{a}/10}\nonumber\\ \eta_{b}&=&\eta_{{\rm det } , b}10^{-\xi_{b } l_{b}/10}\ , . \label{ex data i}\end{aligned}\ ] ] here , @xmath115 is the dark count rate of the detector , @xmath113 is the alignment error rate , @xmath116 is alice s ( bob s ) overall transmission rate , @xmath117 ( @xmath118 ) is the quantum efficiency of alice s ( bob s ) detector , @xmath119 is alice s ( bob s ) channel transmission rate , and @xmath120 ( @xmath121 ) is the distance between alice ( bob ) and mu . 
 the first term and the second term in @xmath122 or @xmath123 respectively represent the alignment error , which is assumed to be proportional to the probability of having correct bit value due to the detection of the light , and errors due to dark counting ( one detector clicks due to the dark counting while the other one does not ) . 
 we take the following parameters from gys experiment @xcite : @xmath124 , @xmath125 , @xmath126 ( db / km ) , @xmath127 , and @xmath128 , and we simulate the key generation rate as a function of the distance between alice and bob in fig . 
 [ fig : key33 ] . in the figure 
 , we consider two settings : ( a ) mu is at bob s side , i.e. , @xmath112 ( b ) mu is just in the middle between alice and bob . 
 the reason why we consider these setting is that the basis - dependent flaw is dependent on intensities that alice and bob employ , and it is not trivial where we should place mu for the better performance . 
 since mdiqkd polarization encoding scheme without basis - dependent flaw achieves almost twice the distance of bb84 @xcite , we may expect that the setting ( b ) could achieve almost twice the distance of bb84 without phase randomization that achieves about 13 ( km ) @xcite with the same experimental parameters . 
 the simulation result , however , does not follow this intuition since we have the basis - dependent flaw not only from alice s side but also from bob s side . 
 thus , the advantage that we obtain from putting mu between alice and bob is overwhelmed by the double basis - dependent flaw . in each setting , we have optimized the intensity of the coherent pulses @xmath12 for each distance ( see fig . 
 [ fig : intensity33 ] ) .    in order to explain why the optimal @xmath129 is so small 
 , note that scheme i intrinsically suffers from the basis - dependent flaw due to eq . 
 ( [ delta11 ] ) . 
 this means that if we use relatively large @xmath129 , then we can not generate the key due to the flaw . 
 actually , when we set @xmath130 , which is a typical order of the amplitude for decoy bb84 , one can see that the upper bound of the phase error rate is @xmath131 even in the zero distance , i.e. , @xmath132 , and we have no chance to generate the key with this amplitude . 
 thus , alice and bob have to reduce the intensities in order to suppress the basis - dependent flaw . 
 also , as the distance gets larger and the losses get increased , alice and bob have to use weaker pulses since larger losses can be exploited by eve to enhance the basis - dependent flaw according to eq . 
 ( [ fdelta ] ) , and they can reduce the intensities until it reaches the cut - off value where the detection of the weak pulses is overwhelmed by the dark counts .    in the above simulation , we have assumed that alice and bob can prepare states very accurately , however in reality , they can only prepare approximate states due to the imperfection of the sources . 
 this imperfection gives more basis - dependent flaw , and in order to estimate the effect of this imperfection , we assume that the fidelity between the two actually prepared density matrices in two bases is approximated by the fidelity between the following density matrices ( see appendix b for the detail ) @xmath133 and @xmath134 where we assume an imperfect phase modulator whose degree of the phase modulation error is proportional to the target phase modulation value , and @xmath135 represents the imperfection of the phase modulation that is related with the extinction ratio @xmath136 as @xmath137 in this equation , we assume that the non - zero extinction ratio is only due to the imperfection of the phase modulators . since imperfect phase modulation results in the same effect as the alignment errors , i.e. , the pulses are routed to a wrong output port , we assume that the alignment error rate is increased with this imperfection . thus , in the simulation accommodating the imperfection of the phase modulation , we replace @xmath113 with @xmath138 . here , we have used a pessimistic assumption that the effect of the phase modulation becomes @xmath139-times higher than before since each of alice and bob has one phase modulator and mu has two phase modulators for the phase shift of two polarization modes ( note from eq . 
 ( [ mimperfect phase modulator ] ) that @xmath136 is approximately proportional to @xmath140 , thus 4 times degradation in terms of the accuracy of the phase modulation results in @xmath139-times degradation in terms of the extinction ratio ) . 
 we also remark that in practice , it is more likely that the phase encoding errors are independent , in which case a factor of 4 will suffice and the key rate will actually be higher than what is presented in our paper . on the other hand , we have to use the following @xmath100 when we consider the security : @xmath141/2\,.\end{aligned}\ ] ]    in figs . 
 [ fig : keyimpferfectpmi ] and [ fig : intensityimpferfectpmi ] , we plot the key generation rate and the corresponding optimal alice s mean photon numbers ( @xmath12 ) as a function of the distance between alice and bob . in the figures , we define @xmath142 that satisfies @xmath143 as @xmath144 , where @xmath145 is the typical order of @xmath136 in some experiments @xcite . 
 we have confirmed that we can not generate the key when @xmath145 . 
 however , we can see in the figures that if the accuracy of the phase modulation is increased three times or five times , i.e. , @xmath146 and @xmath147 , then we can generate the key . like the case in fig . 
 [ fig : intensity33 ] , the small optimal mean photon number can be intuitively understood by the arguments that we have already made in this section .    in order to investigate the feasibility of the phase encoding scheme i with the current technologies , we replace @xmath125 , @xmath127 , and @xmath128 with @xmath148 , @xmath149 @xcite , and @xmath150 @xcite . 
 we see in fig . [ 
 fig : keyimpferfectpminew ] that the key generation is possible over much longer distances with those parameters assuming the precise control of the intensities of the laser source . 
 we also show the corresponding optimal mean photon number @xmath129 in fig . 
 [ fig : intensityimpferfectpminew ] . 
 we note that thanks to the higher quantum efficiency , the success probability becomes higher , following that alice and bob can use larger mean photon number @xmath129 compared to those in figs . 
 [ fig : intensityimpferfectpmi ] and [ fig : intensityimpferfectpminew ] .    ) of @xmath110 and imperfect phase modulators . 
 @xmath151 represents the typical amount of the phase modulation error , and we plot the key rate for smaller imperfection of @xmath152 and @xmath153 . dashed line : mu is at bob s side , i.e. , @xmath112 . 
 solid line : mu is just in the middle between alice and bob.[fig : keyimpferfectpmi ] ]    ) that outputs fig . 
 [ fig : keyimpferfectpmi ] as a function of the distance between alice and bob .

 [ fig : keyimpferfectpminew ] as a function of the distance between alice and bob . 
 [ fig : intensityimpferfectpminew ] ]      in the phase encoding scheme ii , note that we can generate the key only from the successful detection event in mu given both of alice and bob send out a single - photon since if either or both of alice and bob emit more than one photon , then eve can employ the so - called photon number splitting attack @xcite . 
 thus , the important quantities to estimate are @xmath154 , @xmath155 , @xmath105 , @xmath156 , which respectively represents gain in @xmath6-basis given both of alice and bob emit a single - photon , the phase error rate given alice and bob emit a single - photon , overall bit error rate in @xmath6-basis , and overall gain in @xmath6-basis . to estimate these quantities stemming from the simultaneous single - photon emission , 
 we assume the use of infinite number of decoy states for the simplicity of analysis @xcite . 
 another important quantity in our study is the fidelity @xmath157 ( @xmath158 ) between alice s ( bob s ) @xmath6-basis and @xmath7-basis density matrices of only single - photon component , _ not _ whole optical modes . 
 if this fidelity is given , then we have @xmath159 for the simplicity of the discussion , we consider the case of @xmath160 in our simulation . 
 the estimation of the fidelity only in the single - photon part is very important , however to the best of our knowledge we do not know any experiment directly measuring this quantity . 
 this measurement may require photon number resolving detectors and very accurate interferometers . 
 thus , we again assume that the degradation of the fidelity is only due to the imperfect phase modulation given by eq . 
 ( [ mimperfect phase modulator ] ) , and we presume that the fidelity of the two density matrices between the two bases is approximated by the fidelity between the following density matrices ( see appendix b for the detail ) @xmath161\nonumber\\ 
 \rho_{y}^{(1)}&=&\frac{1}{2}\big[{\hat p}\left(\frac{{\left| 0_z \right\rangle}+i e^{i|\delta|/2}{\left| 1_z \right\rangle}}{\sqrt{2}}\right)\nonumber\\ & + & { \hat p}\left(\frac{{\left| 0_z \right\rangle}-i e^{-i|\delta|/2}{\left| 1_z \right\rangle}}{\sqrt{2}}\right)\big]\,.\end{aligned}\ ] ] with these parameters , we can express the key generation rate given alice and bob use @xmath6-basis as @xcite @xmath162-f(\delta_{x})q_{x}h(\delta_{x})\,,\end{aligned}\ ] ] where @xmath163 is the @xmath164 version of @xmath80 in eq . 
 ( [ key rate ] ) .    to simulate the resulting key generation rate , 
 the bit errors are assumed to stem from multi - photon component , the dark counting , and the misalignment that is assumed to be proportional to the probability of obtaining the correct bit values only due to the detection by optical pulses . 
 like before , we also assume that all the detectors have the same characteristics , alice and bob choose the intensities of the signal lights in such a way that the intensities of the incoming pulses to mu are the same , and all the quantum inefficiencies of the detectors can be attributed to part of the losses in the quantum channel . 
 finally , alice s and bob s coherent light sources are assumed to be phase randomized , and the imperfect phase modulation is represented by the increase of the alignment error rate . with these assumptions , we may have the following resulting experimental parameters    @xmath165\nonumber\\ & + & w^{(2,1)}+w^{(2,0)}\nonumber\\ \delta_{x}^{(1,1)}&=&\big\{4\alpha_{a}\alpha_{b}\eta_{a}\eta_{b}e^{-2(\alpha_{a}+\alpha_{b})}p_{\rm dark}(1-p_{\rm dark})^2/2\nonumber\\ & + & 2(e_{\rm ali}+4\eta_{\rm ex})\alpha_{a}\alpha_{b}\eta_{a}\eta_{b}e^{-2(\alpha_{a}+\alpha_{b})}(1-p_{\rm dark})^2\nonumber\\ & + & ( w^{(2,1)}+w^{(2,0)})/2\big\}/q^{(1,1)}_{x}\nonumber\\ q^{(1,1)}_{y}&=&q^{(1,1)}_{x}\nonumber\\ \delta^{(1,1)}_{y}&=&\delta^{(1,1)}_{x}\nonumber\\ w^{(2,1)}&\equiv&8\alpha_{a}\alpha_{b}e^{-2(\alpha_{a}+\alpha_{b})}\big[\eta_{a}(1-\eta_{b})+(1-\eta_{a})\eta_{b}\big]\nonumber\\ & \times&p_{\rm dark}(1-p_{\rm dark})^2\nonumber\\ w^{(2,0)}&\equiv&16\alpha_{a}\alpha_{b}(1-\eta_{a})(1-\eta_{b})e^{-2(\alpha_{a}+\alpha_{b})}\nonumber\\ & \times&p_{\rm dark}^2(1-p_{\rm dark})^2\nonumber\\ q_{x}&=&2\left[1-(1-p_{\rm dark})e^{-\alpha_{\rm in}}\right]^2(1-p_{\rm dark})^2e^{-2\alpha_{\rm in}}+v \nonumber\\ \delta_{x}&=&v+(e_{\rm ali}+4\eta_{\rm ex})2\left(1-e^{-\alpha_{\rm in}}\right)^2 \nonumber\\ & \times&(1-p_{\rm dark})^2e^{-2\alpha_{\rm in}}\nonumber\\ v&\equiv&\frac{p_{\rm dark}(1-p_{\rm dark})}{2\pi}\nonumber\\ & \times&\int_{0}^{2\pi}d\theta\big[1-(1-p_{\rm dark})e^{-\alpha_{\rm in}|1+e^{i\theta}|^2}\big ] \nonumber\\ & \times&\big[(1-p_{\rm dark})e^{-\alpha_{\rm in}|1-e^{i\theta}|^2}\big]\nonumber\\ & + & \frac{p_{\rm dark}(1-p_{\rm dark})}{2\pi}\nonumber\\ & \times&\int_{0}^{2\pi}d\theta\big[1-(1-p_{\rm dark})e^{-\alpha_{\rm in}|1-e^{i\theta}|^2}\big ] \nonumber\\ & \times&\big[(1-p_{\rm dark})e^{-\alpha_{\rm in}|1+e^{i\theta}|^2}\big]\nonumber\\ \alpha_{\rm in}&\equiv&\alpha_{a}\eta_{a}=\alpha_{b}\eta_{b}\nonumber\\ \eta_{a}&=&\eta_{{\rm det } , a}10^{-\xi_{a } l_{a}/10}/2\nonumber\\ \eta_{b}&=&\eta_{{\rm det } , b}10^{-\xi_{b } l_{b}/10}/2\ , \label{exp - data - ii}\end{aligned}\ ] ]    note that @xmath12 ( @xmath166 ) represents each of the intensity of alice s ( bob s ) signal light and the reference light , _ not _ the total intensity of them , and @xmath167 and @xmath168 are divided by @xmath169 since the conversion efficiency of our converter is @xmath66 . 
 @xmath170 in @xmath171 again comes from the pessimistic assumption that each of alice s and bob s phase modulator is imperfect , and @xmath172 ( @xmath173 ) represents the probability of the event where both of alice and bob emit a single - photon and only one ( zero ) photon is detected but the successful detection event is obtained due to the dark counting . on the other hand , the quantity that quantifies the basis - dependent flaw @xmath88 in the present case is upper bounded by @xmath174\nonumber\\ q^{(1,1)}&\equiv&(q^{(1,1)}_{x}+q^{(1,1)}_{y})/2\end{aligned}\ ] ] where @xmath175 is the probability that mu receives a single - photon both from alice and 
 bob simultaneously conditioned on that each of alice and bob sends out a single - photon . 
 we remark that @xmath100 in this scheme is only dependent on the accuracy of the phase modulation . 
 this is different from scheme i where the manipulation of the intensities of the pulses can affect the basis - dependent flaw .    in the simulation 
 , we again assume gys experimental parameters and we consider two settings : ( a ) mu is at bob s side and ( b ) mu is just in the middle between alice and bob . 
 note that @xmath100 is independent of @xmath12 and @xmath166 in the phase encoding scheme ii case .    in fig . 
 [ f1 ] , we plot the key generation rates of ( a ) and ( b ) for @xmath176 , @xmath177 , @xmath178 , @xmath179 ( recall from eq . 
 ( [ mimperfect phase modulator ] ) that @xmath180 that corresponds to the typical extinction ratio of @xmath181 ) , which respectively correspond to @xmath182 , @xmath183 , @xmath184 , and @xmath185 , and the achievable distances of ( a ) and ( b ) increase with the improvement of the accuracy , i.e. , with the decrease of @xmath135 . 
 we have confirmed that no key can be distilled in ( a ) and ( b ) when @xmath186 . 
 the figure shows that the achievable distance drops significantly with the degradation of the accuracy of the phase modulator , and the main reason of this fast decay is that @xmath88 is approximated by @xmath187 and this dominator decreases exponentially with the increase of the distance . 
 we also plot the corresponding optimal @xmath129 in fig . 
 notice that the mean photon number increases in some regime in some cases of ( a ) , and recall that this increase does not change @xmath100 . 
 if we increased the intensity in scheme i with the distance , then we would have more basis - dependent flaw , resulting in shortening of the achievable distance . 
 this may be an intuitive reason why we see no such increase in figs . 
 [ fig : intensity33 ] , [ fig : intensityimpferfectpmi ] , and 9 .    like in the phase encoding scheme i 
 , we investigate the feasibility of the phase encoding scheme ii with the current technologies by replacing @xmath125 , @xmath127 , and @xmath128 with @xmath148 , @xmath149 @xcite , and @xmath150 @xcite . with this upgrade 
 , we have confirmed the impossibility of the key generation , however if we double the quantum efficiency of the detector or equivalently , if we assume the polarization encoding so that the factor of @xmath131 , which is introduced by the phase - to - polarization converter , is removed both from @xmath167 and @xmath168 in eq . 
 ( [ exp - data - ii ] ) , then we can generate the key , which is shown in fig . [ f1new ] ( also see fig . 
 finally , we note that our simulation is essentially the same as the polarization coding since the fact that we use phase encoding is only reflected by the dominator of 2 in @xmath188 and @xmath189 in eq . 
 ( [ exp - data - ii ] ) . 
 thus , the behavior of the key generation rate against the degradation of the state preparation is the same also in polarization based mdiqkd . 
 also note that even in the standard bb84 , @xmath88 decays exponentially with increasing distance . 
 thus , we conclude that very precise state preparation is very crucial in the security of not only mdiqkd but also in standard qkd 
 . we also note that our estimation of the fidelity might be too pessimistic since we have assumed that the degradation of the extinction ratio is only due to imperfect phase modulation . in reality 
 , the imperfection of mach - zehnder interferometer and other imperfections should contribute to the degradation , and the fidelity should be closer to @xmath52 than the one based on our model .    .

 in summary , we have proposed two phase encoding mdiqkd schemes . 
 the first scheme is based on the phase locking technique and the other one is based on the conversion of the pulses in the standard phase encoding bb84 to polarization modes . 
 we proved the security of the first scheme , which intrinsically possesses basis - dependent flaw , as well as the second scheme with the assumption of the basis - dependent flaw in the single - photon part of the pulses . 
 based on the security proof , we also evaluate the effect of imperfect state preparation , and especially we focus our attention to the imperfect phase modulation . 
 while the first scheme can cover relatively short distances of the key generation , this scheme has an advantage that the basis - dependent flaw can be controlled by the intensities of the pulses . 
 thanks to this property , we have confirmed based on a simple model that 3 or 5 times of the improvement in the accuracy of the phase modulation is enough to generate the key . moreover , we have confirmed that the key generation is possible even without these improvements if we implement this scheme by using the up - to - date technologies and the control of intensities of the laser source is precise . on the other hand , it is not so clear to us how accurate we can lock the phase of two spatially separated laser sources , which is important for the performance of scheme i. our result still implies that scheme i can tolerate up to some extent of the imperfect phase locking errors , which should be basically the same as the misalignment errors , but further analysis of the accuracy from the experimental viewpoint is necessary . we leave this problem for the future studies . 
 -basis when @xmath176 , @xmath193 , @xmath194 where @xmath135 is the amount of the phase modulation error . 
 [ sf1 ] ]    ) that outputs fig . 
 [ sf2 ] ]    the second scheme can cover much longer distances when the fidelity of the _ single - photon components _ of @xmath7-basis and @xmath6-basis density matrices is perfect or extremely close to perfect . when we consider 
 the slight degradations of the fidelity , however , we found that the achievable distances drop significantly . 
 this suggests that we need a photon source with a very high fidelity , and very accurate estimation of the fidelity of the single - photon subspace is also indispensable .    in our estimation of the imperfection of the phase modulation 
 , we simply assume that the degradation of the extinction ratio is only due to imperfect phase modulation , which might be too pessimistic , and the imperfection of mach - zehnder interferometer and other imperfections contribute to the degradation . 
 thus , the actual fidelity between the density matrices of the single - photon part in two bases might be very close to 1 , which should be experimentally confirmed for the secure communication . 
 we note that the use of the passive device to prepare the state @xcite may be a promising way for the very accurate state preparation . 
 we remark that the accurate preparation of the state is very important not only in mdiqkd but also in standard qkd where eve can enhance the imbalance of the quantum coin exponentially with the increase of the distance . to see this point , we respectively plot in fig . 
 [ sf1 ] and fig . 
 [ sf2 ] the key generation rate of standard bb84 with infinite decoy states in @xmath6-basis and its optimal mean photon number assuming @xmath148 , @xmath195 @xcite , @xmath150 , @xmath124 , and @xmath126 . 
 again , @xmath196 is the typical value of the phase modulation error , and we see in the figure that the degradation of the phase modulator in terms of the accuracy significantly decreases the achievable distance of secure key generation . 
 one notices that standard decoy bb84 is more robust against the degradation since the probability that the measurement outcome of the quantum coin along @xmath6-basis is @xmath14 given the successful detection of the signal by bob is written as @xmath197 rather than @xmath198 . on the other hand 
 , one has to remember that we trust the operation of bob s detectors in this simulation , which may not hold in practice . 
 finally , we neglect the effect of the fluctuation of the intensity and the center frequency of the laser light in our study , which we will analyze in the future works . in summary , 
 our work highlights the importance of very accurate preparation of the states to avoid basis - dependent flaws .

 in this appendix , we give a detailed calculation about how scheme i works when there is no channel losses and noises . in order to calculate the joint probability that alice and bob obtain type-0 successful event , where only the detector d0 clicks , and they share the maximally entangled state @xmath32 
 , we introduce a projector @xmath200 that corresponds to type-0 successful event . here 
 , @xmath201 represents the non - vacuum state . 
 the state after alice and bob have the type-0 successful event @xmath202 ( see eq . 
 ( [ normal schi ] ) for the definition of @xmath26 ) can be expressed by @xmath203 here , @xmath204 is an identity operator on @xmath205 and @xmath206 , @xmath207 and @xmath208 are complex numbers , and @xmath209 and @xmath210 are orthonormal bases , which are related with each other through @xmath211 by a direct calculation , one can show that latexmath:[\ ] ] here , @xmath240 , @xmath241 , and @xmath242 , and @xmath243 is defined by @xmath244 where @xmath245 is a purification of @xmath246 , which is the state that alice actually prepares for the bit value @xmath247 in basis @xmath248 , and @xmath249 is alice s qubit system . 
 one can choose any purification for @xmath245 , and in particular it should be chosen in such a way that it maximizes the inner product in eq . 
 ( c2 ) or ( c3 ) . 
 one can similarly define @xmath250 , and @xmath46 is introduced via considering a joint state involving the quantum coin as @xmath251 due to this change , the figures for the key generation rate have to be revised . as the examples of revised figures , we show the revised version of figs . 8 , 9 , 12 , and 13 , which are the most important figures for our main conclusions to hold . 
 notice that there are only minor changes in figs . 8 and 9 and 
 the changes in figs . 
 12 and 13 are relatively big 
 . however , the big changes do not affect the validity of the main conclusions in our paper , which is the importance of the state preparation in mdiqkd and the fact that our schemes can generate the key with the practical channel mode that we have assumed .              for the derivation of eq . 
 ( [ 0 ] ) , we invoke koashi s proof @xcite . 
 to apply koashi s proof , it is important to ensure that i ) one of the two parties holds a virtual * qubit * ( rather than a higher dimensional system ) and ii ) the fictitious measurements performed on the virtual qubit have to form * conjugate * observables . 
 therefore , it is not valid to consider fidelity alone ( which allows arbitrary purifications that may not satisfy the conjugate observables requirement ) . 
 fortunately , it turns out to be easy to modify our equation to satisfy the above two requirements .    since the difference between eq . 
 ( c2 ) and eq . 
 ( c3 ) comes from whether we consider alice s virtual qubit or bob s virtual qubit , we focus only on eq . 
 ( c2 ) and the same argument holds for eq . 
 ( c3 ) . in koashi s 
 proof , the security is guaranteed via two alternative tasks , ( i ) agreement on x ( key distillation basis ) and ( ii ) alice s or bob s preparation of an eigenstate of y , the conjugate basis of x , with use of an extra communication channel . the problem with the original ( i.e. uncorrected ) version of eq . 
 ( 9 ) is the following . 
 if we use the uncorrected version of eq . 
 ( 9 ) in our paper , then the use of the fidelity means that the real part in eq . 
 ( c2 ) is equivalent to @xmath252 with the maximization over _ all possible _ local unitary operators @xmath253 . in this case , if alice performs a measurement along x basis , then it violates the correspondence between her sending state @xmath246 and her qubit state @xmath254 in general , and thus , in the uncorrected version of eq . 
 ( 9 ) in our paper , the argument based on the fidelity does not guarantee the security of the protocol . 
 in contrast , with the corrected version of eq . 
 ( 9 ) in our paper , since the maximization over @xmath46 and @xmath255 in eq . 
 ( c2 ) preserves the relationship between alice s sending state and her qubit state as well as the conjugate relationship between x and y , we can apply koashi s proof for the security argument of the protocol .

 the definition of the four bell state is as follows . 
 @xmath257=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}[{\left| 0_x \right\rangle}_{a1}{\left| 0_x \right\rangle}_{b1}-{\left| 1_x \right\rangle}_{a1}{\left| 1_x \right\rangle}_{b1}]$ ] , @xmath258=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}[{\left| 0_x \right\rangle}_{a1}{\left| 1_x \right\rangle}_{b1}+{\left| 
 1_x \right\rangle}_{a1}{\left| 0_x \right\rangle}_{b1}]$ ] , @xmath259=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}[{\left| 0_x \right\rangle}_{a1}{\left| 0_x \right\rangle}_{b1}+{\left| 
 1_x \right\rangle}_{a1}{\left| 1_x \right\rangle}_{b1}]$ ] , and @xmath260 . 
 one of the most simplest proofs is shor - preskill s proof @xcite . 
 the intuition of this proof is as follows . 
 note that if alice and bob share some pairs of @xmath32 , ( i.e. , alice has one half of each pair and bob has the other half ) , then they can generate a secure key by performing @xmath6-basis measurement . 
 the reason of the security is that this state is a pure state , which means that this state has no correlations with the third system including eve s system . 
 due to the intervention by eve , alice and bob do not share this pure state in general , but instead they share noisy pairs . 
 the basic idea of the proof is to consider the distillation of @xmath32 from the noisy pairs . 
 for the distillation , note that @xmath32 is only one qubit pair state that has no bit errors in @xmath6-basis ( we call this error as the bit error ) and has no bit errors in @xmath7-basis ( we call this error as the phase error ) . 
 it is known that if alice and bob employ the so - called css code ( calderbank - shor - steane code ) @xcite , then the noisy pairs are projected to a classical mixture of the four bell states , i.e. , @xmath32 , @xmath37 ( @xmath32 with the phase error ) , @xmath33 ( @xmath32 with the bit error ) , and @xmath38 ( @xmath32 with both the phase and bit errors ) . 
 moreover , if alice and bob choose a correct css code , which can be achieved by random sampling procedure , then css code can detect the position of the erroneous pair with high probability . 
 thus , by performing bit and phase flip operation depending on the detected error positions , alice and bob can distill some qubit pairs that are very close in fidelity to the product state of @xmath32 . 
 in general , implementation of the above scheme requires a quantum computer . 
 fortunately , shor - preskill showed that the bit error detection and bit flip operation can be done classically , and the phase error detection and phase flip operation need not be done , but exactly the same key can be obtained by the privacy amplification , so that we do not need to possess a quantum computer for the key distillation .

 386 - 406 .","in this paper , we study the unconditional security of the so - called measurement device independent quantum key distribution ( mdiqkd ) with the basis - dependent flaw in the context of phase encoding schemes . 
 we propose two schemes for the phase encoding , the first one employs a phase locking technique with the use of non - phase - randomized coherent pulses , and the second one uses conversion of standard bb84 phase encoding pulses into polarization modes . 
 we prove the unconditional security of these schemes and we also simulate the key generation rate based on simple device models that accommodate imperfections . 
 our simulation results show the feasibility of these schemes with current technologies and highlight the importance of the state preparation with good fidelity between the density matrices in the two bases . 
 since the basis - dependent flaw is a problem not only for mdiqkd but also for standard qkd , our work highlights the importance of an accurate signal source in practical qkd systems . 
 + * note : we include the erratum of this paper in appendix c. the correction does not affect the validity of the main conclusions reported in the paper , which is the importance of the state preparation in mdiqkd and the fact that our schemes can generate the key with the practical channel mode that we have assumed . *",arxiv
"modified theories of gravity have attained much attention after the discovery of expanding accelerated universe . 
 the basic ingredient responsible for this tremendous change in cosmic history is some mysterious type force having repulsive nature dubbed as dark energy . 
 the enigmatic nature of this energy has motivated many researchers to unveil its hidden characteristics which are still not known . 
 modified gravity approach is considered as the promising and optimistic scenario among several other proposals that have been presented to explore the salient features of dark energy . 
 these modified theories are established by adding or replacing curvature invariants and their corresponding generic functions in the einstein - hilbert action . 
 lovelock theory of gravity is the direct generalization of general relativity ( gr ) in @xmath3-dimensions which coincides with gr in @xmath4-dimensions @xcite . 
 the ricci scalar @xmath5 is known as first lovelock scalar while gauss - bonnet ( gb ) invariant is the second lovelock scalar yielding einstein - gauss - bonnet gravity in @xmath6-dimensions @xcite . 
 the gb invariant is a linear combination with an interesting feature that it is free from spin-2 ghost instabilities defined as @xcite @xmath7 where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the ricci and riemann tensors , respectively . 
 this quadratic curvature invariant is a topological term in 4-dimensions which possesses trivial contribution in the field equations . to discuss the dynamics of gb invariant in 4-dimensions , 
 there are two interesting scenarios either to couple @xmath1 with scalar field or to add generic function @xmath10 in the einstein - hilbert action . 
 the first scheme naturally appears in the effective action in string theory which investigates singularity - free cosmological solutions @xcite . 
 the second approach known as @xmath10 gravity is introduced as an alternative for dark energy which successfully discusses the late - time cosmological evolution @xcite . 
 this modified theory of gravity is endowed with a quite rich cosmological structure as well as consistent with solar system constraints @xcite . 
 the current cosmic accelerated expansion has also been discussed in modified theories of gravity involving the curvature - matter coupling . 
 harko et al . 
 @xcite established @xmath11 gravity to study the curvature - matter coupling . 
 recently , we introduced the curvature - matter coupling in @xmath10 gravity named as @xmath0 theory of gravity @xcite . 
 this coupling yields non - zero covariant divergence of the energy - momentum tensor and an extra force appears due to which massive test particles follow non - geodesic trajectories while geodesic lines of geometry are followed by the dust particles . 
 shamir and ahmad @xcite constructed some cosmologically viable models in @xmath0 gravity using noether symmetry approach . 
 it is mentioned here that cosmic expansion can be obtained from geometric as well as matter components in such coupling . 
 the reconstruction as well as stability of cosmic evolutionary models in modified theories of gravity are the captivating issues in cosmology . in reconstruction technique , 
 any known cosmic solution is used in the modified field equations to find the corresponding function which reproduces the given evolutionary cosmic history . in stability analysis , the isotropic and homogeneous perturbations are usually considered in which hubble parameter as well as energy density are perturbed to examine the background stability as time evolves @xcite . 
 nojiri et al . 
 @xcite formulated the reconstruction scheme to reproduce some cosmological models in @xmath12 gravity . 
 elizalde et al . 
 @xcite applied the same scenario for @xmath13cdm cosmology ( @xmath13 denotes cosmological constant while cdm stands for cold dark matter ) in @xmath14 gravity as well as in modified gb theories of gravity . 
 the stability of power - law solutions are also discussed in modified gravity theories @xcite . 
 sez - gmez @xcite explored the cosmological solutions in @xmath12 horava - lifshitz gravity and analyzed their stability against first order perturbations around frw universe . 
 myrzakulov and his collaborators @xcite discussed the cosmological models and found that @xmath10 gravity could successfully explain the cosmic evolutionary history . 
 jamil et al . 
 @xcite reconstructed the cosmological models in @xmath11 gravity and found that numerical analysis for hubble parameter is in good agreement with observational data for redshift parameter @xmath15 . 
 the stability of de sitter , power - law solutions as well as @xmath13cdm are analyzed in the context of @xmath14 gravity @xcite . 
 salako et al . 
 @xcite studied the cosmological reconstruction , stability as well as thermodynamics including first and second laws for @xmath13cdm model in generalized teleparallel theory of gravity . 
 sharif and zubair @xcite demonstrated that @xmath11 gravity can reproduce @xmath13cdm model , phantom or non - phantom eras , de sitter universe and power - law cosmic history . 
 they also analyzed the stability of reconstructed de sitter as well as power - law solutions .    in this paper , we reconstruct various cosmological models including de sitter universe , power - law solutions , phantom or non - phantom eras and @xmath13cdm model in @xmath0 theory . 
 we also analyze the stability against linear homogeneous perturbations for de sitter as well as power - law solutions . 
 the paper has the following format . in section 
 * 2 * , we formulate the modified field equations while section * 3 * is devoted to reconstruct some known cosmological solutions in this gravity . 
 section * 4 * analyzes the stability of specific solutions against linear perturbations around frw universe model . 
 the results are summarized in the last section . 
 the action for @xmath0 gravity is defined as @xcite @xmath16 where @xmath17 and @xmath18 represent coupling constant , determinant of the metric tensor ( @xmath19 ) and lagrangian associated with matter distribution , respectively . 
 varying eq.([1 ] ) with respect to @xmath19 , we obtain the field equations @xmath20f_{\mathcal{g}}(\mathcal{g},t ) \\\nonumber&-&[2rg_{\alpha\beta } \box-4r_{\alpha\beta}\box-2r\nabla_{\alpha}\nabla_{\beta } + 4r^{\mu}_{\beta}\nabla_{\alpha}\nabla_{\mu } + 4r^{\mu}_{\alpha}\nabla_{\beta}\nabla_{\mu}\\\label{2}&- & 4g_{\alpha\beta}r^{\mu\nu } \nabla_{\mu}\nabla_{\nu}+4r_{\alpha\mu\beta\nu } \nabla^{\mu}\nabla^{\nu}]f_{\mathcal{g}}(\mathcal{g},t)=0,\end{aligned}\ ] ] where @xmath21 ( @xmath22 denotes a covariant derivative ) and @xmath23 is the energy - momentum tensor . 
 the expressions for @xmath23 and @xmath24 are @xcite @xmath25 where we have assumed that @xmath18 depends only on @xmath19 rather than its derivatives . the non - zero divergence of @xmath23 is given by @xmath26.\end{aligned}\ ] ] the above equations indicate that the complete dynamics of @xmath0 gravity is based on the suitable choice of @xmath18 . 
 the energy - momentum tensor for perfect fluid is @xmath27 where @xmath28 and @xmath29 represent the four velocity , energy density and pressure of matter distribution , respectively . in this case , the expression for @xmath24 becomes @xmath30 where @xmath31 . 
 the line element for frw universe model is given by @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the scale factor . 
 using eqs.([5])-([7 ] ) in ( [ 2 ] ) , we obtain the corresponding field equation as follows @xmath34 where @xmath35 and dot represents derivative with respect to time . 
 the non - zero continuity equation ( [ 4 ] ) takes the form @xmath36.\ ] ] the standard conservation law holds if right hand side of this equation vanishes . for equation of state @xmath37 ( 
 @xmath38 is the equation of state parameter ) , eq.([9 ] ) yields @xmath39 with additional constraint @xmath40    we rewrite the above equations in terms of new variable @xmath41 known as e - folding instead of @xmath42 which is also related with redshift parameter @xmath43 as @xcite @xmath44 using the above definition of @xmath41 , eqs.([8 ] ) and ( [ 9 ] ) become @xmath45,\end{aligned}\ ] ] where @xmath46 and prime denotes derivative with respect to @xmath41 . 
 the simplest choice of @xmath0 model is @xmath47 which possesses no direct non - minimally coupling between curvature and matter . for this particular model , the field equation ( [ 13 ] ) 
 splits into a set of two ordinary differential equations as @xmath48 @xmath49 where @xmath50 and @xmath51 . 
 the field equations for perfect fluid matter distribution in @xmath10 gravity is recovered if @xmath52 vanishes while gr is achieved for @xmath53 . 
 in this section , we reproduce different cosmological scenarios including de sitter universe , power - law solutions , phantom / non - phantom eras and @xmath13cdm model in @xmath0 gravity .      the de sitter cosmic evolution is interesting and well - known as it elegantly describes current expansion of the universe . 
 the scale factor of this evolutionary model grows exponentially with constant hubble parameter @xmath54 , defined as @xcite @xmath55 where @xmath56 is an integration constant . 
 equation ( [ 10 ] ) gives energy density of the form @xmath57 where @xmath58 and @xmath59 is a constant . 
 using eqs.([1d ] ) and ( [ 2d ] ) in ( [ 8 ] ) , we obtain @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the gb invariant at @xmath54 . 
 the solution of the above differential equation is @xmath62 where @xmath63 s @xmath64 are integration constants . since we have used the continuity equation ( [ 10 ] ) in eq.([3d ] ) , so we must constrain its solution . using the above equation with eq.([11 ] ) , we obtain the following functions @xmath65 where @xmath66 s @xmath67 are constants in terms of @xmath38 and @xmath68 given in appendix * a*. for the model ( [ 15 ] ) , we have @xmath69 where the first equation corresponds to de sitter universe in the absence of matter contents in @xmath10 gravity @xcite . using the constraint ( [ 11 ] ) 
 , the second equation becomes @xmath70 the solution of eqs.([7d ] ) and ( [ 8d ] ) leads to @xmath71 where @xmath72 s are constants of integration . equations ( [ 4d ] ) and ( [ 9d ] ) indicate that de sitter expansion can also be described in @xmath0 gravity . 
 power - law solutions have significant importance to discuss different evolutionary phases of the universe in modified theory . 
 these solutions describe the decelerated as well as accelerated cosmic eras which are characterized by the scale factor as @xcite @xmath73 the cosmic decelerated phase is observed for @xmath74 including the radiation @xmath75 as well as dust @xmath76 dominated eras while @xmath77 covers the accelerated phase of the universe . 
 for this scale factor , the gb invariant takes the form @xmath78 using eqs.([10 ] ) , ( [ 1p ] ) and ( [ 2p ] ) , the field equation becomes @xmath79 whose solution is given by @xmath80 where @xmath81 s are integration constants and @xmath82,\\\nonumber\gamma_{2}&=&\left[\frac{3}{4}\lambda \tilde{c}_{2}(1+\omega)\{2\tilde{c}_{2}\lambda(1+\omega)+2(\lambda-1 ) -8\}+\frac{1}{4}(\lambda-1)(\lambda-7)+4\right.\\\nonumber&+&\left . 
 8\tilde{c}_{2}(\lambda-1)\left(\frac{1+\omega}{1 - 3\omega}\right ) \right]^{\frac{1}{2}},\quad\gamma_{3}=-\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{1 - 3\omega } { 1+\omega}\right),\quad\gamma_{4}=\frac{2\kappa^2}{\omega-3},\\\nonumber \gamma_{5}&=&\left(\frac{18\lambda^{3}(1 - 3\omega)^{\frac{3\lambda ( 1+\omega)-2}{3\lambda(1+\omega)}}}{3\lambda(1 - 3\omega)+4}\right ) \rho_{0}^{\frac{-2}{3\lambda(1+\omega)}},\quad\gamma_{6}=\frac{2 } { 3\lambda(1+\omega)}.\end{aligned}\ ] ] inserting eq.([4p ] ) in ( [ 11 ] ) , we obtain @xmath83 where @xmath84 s and @xmath85 s @xmath86 are given in appendix * a*.    now we find the expression of @xmath0 for the choice of model ( [ 15 ] ) . the differential equation ( [ 3p ] ) yields two ordinary differential equations in variables @xmath1 and @xmath2 . 
 the first is the second order cauchy - euler s equation related to curvature given by @xmath87 whose solution is given by @xmath88 where @xmath89 s are constants of integration which is consistent with power - law solutions in @xmath10 gravity @xcite . 
 the second equation is obtained using the additional constraint ( [ 11 ] ) as @xmath90 the solution of this equation corresponds to matter distribution given by @xmath91}\left(\frac{t}{\rho_{0}(1 - 3\omega)}\right ) ^{\frac{2}{3\lambda(1+\omega)}},\end{aligned}\ ] ] where @xmath92 s @xmath93 are integration constants . 
 consequently , @xmath0 model becomes @xmath94}\\\label{7p}&\times & \left(\frac{t}{\rho_{0}(1 - 3\omega)}\right)^{\frac{2}{3\lambda(1+\omega)}}.\end{aligned}\ ] ] thus , the power - law solutions are reconstructed which may be helpful to explore the expansion history of the universe in this modified theory of gravity . 
 here , we reconstruct @xmath0 model which can explain the system including both phantom and non - phantom eras . in the einstein gravity , 
 the hubble parameter describing the phantom as well as non - phantom matter distribution is given by @xcite @xmath95 where @xmath96 and @xmath97 represent the model parameter , energy densities of phantom and non - phantom matter fluids , respectively . 
 when the scale factor is large , the first term on right hand side dominates which corresponds to the phantom era of the universe with @xmath98 . 
 the non - phantom era in the early universe is observed for @xmath99 when the scale factor is small and the second term dominates . 
 we rewrite @xmath100 in terms of a new function @xmath101 as @xmath102 so that eq.([1q ] ) becomes @xmath103 where @xmath104 and @xmath105 . 
 the gb invariant takes the form @xmath106 inserting eq.([2q ] ) in ( [ 3q ] ) , we obtain a quadratic equation in @xmath107 whose solution is given by @xmath108 for the sake of simplicity , we consider @xmath109 so that it reduces to @xmath110 using eqs.([2q ] ) and ( [ 4q ] ) in ( [ 8 ] ) , we have @xmath111 which is a complicated partial differential equation whose analytical solution can not be found .    to find the reconstructed @xmath0 model , we consider its particular form ( [ 15 ] ) which provides the following set of differential equations @xmath112 where we have used the additional constraint in the second equation . solving these equations 
 , it follows that @xmath113-\frac{2\kappa^{2}t}{1 - 3\omega}.\end{aligned}\ ] ] where @xmath114 s are constants of integration . 
 thus , phantom and non - phantom cosmic history can be discussed in @xmath0 gravity . 
 now we apply the usual reconstruction technique to reproduce the @xmath13cdm cosmology in this gravity . in gr , 
 the @xmath13cdm cosmological evolution is discussed by adding @xmath13 in the einstein - hilbert action whereas we reconstruct such evolution in the absence of @xmath13 in the action ( [ 1 ] ) . 
 the hubble parameter for @xmath13cdm model is given by @xcite @xmath115 the first term indicates the contribution of cdm while the second term corresponds to @xmath13 . 
 the hubble parameter in terms of gb invariant takes the form @xmath116 equation ( [ 1h ] ) gives @xmath117 using eqs.([2h ] ) and ( [ 3h ] ) in ( [ 13 ] ) , we obtain @xmath118    this equation can not be solved analytically hence we solve it for a specific @xmath0 model ( [ 15 ] ) with dust fluid . 
 the corresponding equations become @xmath119 using constraint ( [ 11 ] ) , the solution of eq.([4h ] ) is given by @xmath120 where @xmath121 s are constants of integration while solution of eq.([5h ] ) can not be found . 
 let us consider the case when @xmath122 with the assumption @xmath123 which reduces eq.([5h ] ) to @xmath124 whose solution yields @xmath125 where @xmath126 s are integration constants . 
 consequently , @xmath0 takes the form @xmath127 provided that @xmath128 . here 
 @xmath0 gravity can not explain @xmath13cdm cosmological evolution rather it corresponds to cdm evolution . 
 in this section , we analyze stability of some cosmological evolutionary solutions about linear homogeneous perturbations in this modified gravity . 
 we construct the perturbed field as well as continuity equations using isotropic and homogeneous universe model for both general and particular cases including de sitter and power - law solutions . 
 we assume a general solution @xmath129 which satisfies the basic field equations for frw universe model in @xmath0 gravity . in terms of the above solution , 
 the expressions for @xmath130 and @xmath131 are @xmath132 for any particular @xmath0 model that can regenerate the above solution ( [ 1 t ] ) , the following equation of motion as well as non - zero divergence of the energy - momentum tensor must be satisfied @xmath133,\end{aligned}\ ] ] where superscript @xmath134 denotes that the function and its corresponding derivatives are calculated at @xmath135 and @xmath136 . if the conservation law holds , we get energy density in terms of @xmath137 as @xmath138 the first order perturbations in hubble parameter and energy density are defined as @xmath139 where @xmath140 and @xmath141 are the perturbation parameters .    in order to analyze first order perturbations about the solution ( [ 1 t ] ) , 
 we apply the series expansion on the function @xmath0 as @xmath142 where @xmath143 involves the terms proportional to quadratic or higher powers of @xmath1 and @xmath2 while only the linear terms are considered . using eqs.([6 t ] ) and ( [ 7 t ] ) in ( [ 8 ] ) , we obtain the following perturbed field equation @xmath144 where @xmath145 s @xmath146 are given in appendix * a*. inserting these perturbations in eq.([9 ] ) , the perturbed continuity equation is @xmath147 where @xmath148 s are provided in appendix * a*. if the conversation law holds in this modified gravity , eq.([9 t ] ) reduces to @xmath149 the perturbed equations ( [ 8 t ] ) and ( [ 9 t ] ) are helpful to analyze the stability of any specific frw cosmological evolutionary model in @xmath0 gravity . for the particular model ( [ 15 ] ) , these perturbed equations reduce to @xmath150 where the coefficients of @xmath151 and their derivatives are expressed in appendix * a*. in the following subsections , we investigate the stability of de sitter and power - law solutions .      consider the de sitter solution @xmath152 , the perturbed equation ( [ 8 t ] ) takes the form @xmath153 f_{\mathcal{g}t}^{0}-3456\rho_{*}h_{0}^{8}(1 - 3\omega)(1+\omega ) f_{\mathcal{gg}t}^{0}\right)\delta+12\rho_{*}h_{0}^{3}\\\nonumber & \times&(1 - 3\omega)f_{\mathcal{g}t}^{0}\dot{\delta}_{m}+\left(\kappa^{2 } \rho_{*}+\frac{1}{2}\rho_{*}(3-\omega)f_{t}^{0}+\rho_{*}^{2}(1 - 3\omega ) ( 1+\omega)f_{tt}^{0}\right.\\\nonumber&-&\left.12\rho _ { * } h_{0}^{2}(1 - 3\omega)[h_{0}^{2}+3(1+\omega)h_{0}^{2}]f_{\mathcal{g}t}^{0 } -36\rho_{*}^{2}h_{0}^{4}(1 - 3\omega)^{2}(1+\omega ) \right.\\\label{13t}&\times&\left.f_{\mathcal{g}tt}^{0}\right)\delta_{m}=0,\end{aligned}\ ] ] where the superscript @xmath154 represents that the function and its corresponding derivatives are evaluated at @xmath155 and @xmath156 . 
 we consider the conserved perturbed equation for stability analysis since the de sitter solutions are constructed using the constraint ( [ 11 ] ) in the previous section . 
 the numerical technique is used to solve eqs.([10 t ] ) and ( [ 13 t ] ) for the model ( [ 5d ] ) . 
 the evolution of @xmath140 and @xmath141 are shown in figure * 1*. we consider @xmath157 and @xmath158 throughout the stability analysis of de sitter universe models whereas integration constants are @xmath159 and @xmath160 . 
 figure * 1 * shows smooth behavior of @xmath140 ( left ) and @xmath141 ( right ) which do not decay in late times indicating that de sitter model ( [ 5d ] ) is unstable . 
 the stability analysis of model ( [ 6d ] ) with same integration constants is shown in figure * 2*. in the left panel , it is observed that small oscillations are produced about @xmath161 while it decays in late times , thus the model ( [ 6d ] ) shows stable behavior against perturbations . for model ( [ 9d ] ) , eq.([13 t ] ) becomes @xmath162 figure * 3 * represents the behavior of @xmath140 and @xmath141 for model ( [ 9d ] ) with integration constants @xmath163 and @xmath164 . 
 it is shown that oscillations in perturbation parameters are produced initially as shown in figure * 3*. this oscillating behavior is clearly observed in figure * 4 * which decays in future for both @xmath140 as well as @xmath141 and hence the solution becomes stable .      here 
 we investigate the stability of power - law solutions . 
 these solutions describe the accelerated as well as decelerated cosmological evolutionary phases in the background of frw universe . 
 we first consider the reconstructed power - law solution ( [ 5p ] ) and numerically solve eqs.([8 t ] ) and ( [ 10 t ] ) . 
 for this model , we choose integration constants @xmath165 and @xmath166 figure * 5 * shows the oscillating behavior of perturbed parameters @xmath167 for the cosmic accelerated era with @xmath168 and @xmath169 . 
 the perturbations around the power - law solutions decay in future leading to stable results . 
 the radiation ( @xmath170 and @xmath171 ) as well as matter ( @xmath172 and @xmath173 ) dominated eras can not be discussed for the model ( [ 5p ] ) because singular as well as complex terms appear which lead to non - physical case . 
 secondly , we consider the model ( [ 6p ] ) and analyze its behavior against linear perturbations . 
 figure * 6 * shows the fluctuating behavior of considered perturbations in the cosmic accelerated phase with @xmath168 and @xmath169 . here 
 , we choose @xmath174 and @xmath166 it is observed that the oscillating behavior disappears in future while both perturbation parameters will not decay in late times leading to unstable cosmological solutions . 
 the considered model can not explain the cosmological evolution corresponding to matter and radiation dominated eras like previous model ( [ 5p ] ) . 
 lastly , we explore the stability of model ( [ 7p ] ) with integration constants @xmath175 and @xmath176 . figure * 7 * represents the evolution of ( @xmath177 ) versus time for @xmath178 with @xmath168 . 
 the left panel shows that the oscillations of @xmath140 decay in late times while fluctuations of @xmath141 remain present in future . since a complete perturbation against any cosmological solution includes the matter perturbations therefore , 
 the solutions are unstable . 
 in this paper , we have employed the reconstruction scheme to @xmath0 gravity in the background of isotropic and homogeneous universe model to reproduce some important cosmological models . 
 the basic aspect of this modified gravity is the coupling between curvature and matter components which yields non - zero divergence of the energy - momentum tensor . 
 we have imposed additional constraint to obtain the standard conservation equation which has been used to explain the cosmic evolution in this gravity . 
 the de sitter and power - law solutions have been reconstructed for general as well as particular cases which are of great interest and have significant importance in cosmology . 
 we have also reconstructed the @xmath0 model which can explain cosmic history of the phantom as well as non - phantom phases of the universe . 
 similar reconstruction technique is carried out for @xmath13cdm model . in this case 
 , we have found that the considered gravity fails to reproduce @xmath13cdm cosmology for both cases . 
 for the specific form of function , this result is consistent with @xmath10 gravity in the absence of matter @xcite . 
 on physical grounds , the stability analysis of different forms of generic function leads to classify the modified theories of gravity .

"type ia supernovae ( sne ia ) , characterized by no @xmath1 but strong si lines in the spectra at the maximum brightness , are brighter than most of sne classified into the other types and exhibit uniform light curves . 
 thus they are used as a standard candle to measure distances to remote galaxies . 
 a plausible explosion model for sne ia is the accreting white dwarf ( wd ) model , in which a white dwarf in a binary system accretes material from the companion star , increases its mass , usually up to the chandrasekhar mass limit ( @xmath2 ) , and then explodes ( e.g. , * ? ? ? 
 . there have been significant progresses in the accreting wd model since @xcite introduced the stellar wind from the wd while it accretes materials from the companion . 
 their model succeeded in sustaining a stable mass transfer in the progenitor systems of sne ia . according to their model 
 , there are two main evolutionary paths leading to sne ia , the super soft x - ray source ( sss ) channel and the symbiotic channel @xcite . 
 accordingly their model predicts which companion stars lead to sne ia .    the above evolutionary scenario for sne ia has not been confirmed by observations , which will require the identification of the companion star that should remain in the vicinity of the explosion site . 
 @xcite argued that their group identified a g2iv star as the companion of tycho brahe s supernova remnant ( snr ) by measuring the velocities and distances of stars in the vicinity of the center of the snr . 
 they concluded that this g2iv star was moving much faster than the other neighbor stars and that the distance to this star seemed consistent with the distance to tycho s snr . 
 although @xcite has argued that the observed velocity of tycho g might correspond to the velocity of stars belonging to the thick disk population , the expected stellar mass in thick disk stars within the cone with 2.87 arcsec radius ( which corresponds to the angular distance from the center of tycho s snr to the tycho g star ) , at 3 kpc from earth , is only 2 @xmath3 , which makes the thick disk star alternative very unlikely . for this estimate 
 we use the density in the vicinity of tycho s snr @xcite .    although the coincidence of the kinematic characteristics of tycho g with its being at the position and distance of the snr appears significant , confirmation by other means would nonetheless be very useful .    in this paper 
 we propose a direct method to prove that the companion star is located inside the sn ejecta . 
 a hint was dropped by observations for a star called s - m star discovered by @xcite near a type ia snr 1006 . 
 @xcite proved that the s - m star was not the companion of this supernova by investigating features of fe ii absorption lines in the ultraviolet ( uv ) spectrum . 
 very broad wings were observed in both blue and red sides of the absorption lines . 
 the line width was a few thousand km / s much larger than the thermal velocity of stellar atmosphere , which is thought to be @xmath410 km / s . 
 the broad wings are likely to be formed by fe ii in the ejecta of snr 1006 ; photons in the blue wing are absorbed by the matter ejected toward us , and those in the red wing away from us . 
 thus it was proved that the s - m star is located behind the snr 1006 ejecta .    when a star is inside the ejecta of sne ia , photons emitted from the star are absorbed only by the ejecta moving toward us . 
 hence the broad wing must be present only in the blue side . 
 the absorption line with only blue wing enables us to identify companion stars of sne ia . 
 @xcite used the uv range to observe the s - m star with the faint object spectrograph on the hubble space telescope . 
 however , in addition to difficulties in uv observations from the ground , companion stars on the evolutionary paths suggested by the above mentioned scenario @xcite may not be bright in the uv range 
 . then we will focus on absorption lines in the visible range . 
 furthermore the corresponding transitions need to be from the ground state because most fe ions in the ejecta are expected to be in the ground state . 
 thus only fe i can produce such absorption lines in sne ia ejecta .    in this paper , we estimate the amount of fe i in the ejecta of tycho s snr by taking account of collisional processes in non - equilibrium and ionizations by photons emitted from the shocked ejecta , and calculate spectra of a star located at the center of a snr and discuss whether we can identify the feature of fe i absorption lines in the spectrum of the companion star . 
 [ cols=""^,^,^,^,^,^ "" , ]     [ tbl : ew ]    even when we find a star that exhibits the absorption feature discussed in this paper , there is a chance that a star other than the companion star happens to be inside the ejecta . 
 a star existing in the vicinity of a sn ia gets a fraction of the explosion energy and is accelerated . 
 if the companion star similar to tycho g star with the mass of @xmath5 1.2 @xmath6 and the radius of @xmath7 2 @xmath8 is located at the distance of @xmath9 5.5 @xmath8 from the progenitor , the size of the roche lobe is comparable to the size of the companion . 
 thus the star in this situation will get the maximum velocity after the explosion . 
 then the orbital velocity before the explosion is @xmath10 km / s . in a 3-d hydrodynamical simulation of sne ia by @xcite 
 , they obtain a plausible kick velocity @xmath11 km / s . therefore , including the orbital velocity , the velocity of the companion star becomes @xmath12 km / s . if the companion star has been moving away from the explosion site at that speed , the companion star is now at the distance of @xmath130.08 pc from the center . 
 the stellar mass density in the neighborhood of tycho s snr estimated from a model of the galaxy @xcite is less than 0.03 @xmath14 . 
 thus the expected stellar mass inside this volume is only @xmath15 . 
 therefore if we find a star showing absorption lines with broad blue wings in the spectrum , it is likely that the star is the companion star . 
 as a consequence , we have demonstrated that there exhibit very deep absorption lines with unique shapes in the spectrum of the companion star located at the center of a young snr such as tycho s snr . 
 there are , however , a few factors that might reduce or even erase these distinct absorption features .    first , the number of fe i in the freely expanding ejecta is very sensitive to the number of ionizing photons emitted from the shocked ejecta . 
 an increase in the number of ionizing photons by a few factors might decrease the number of fe i by a few orders of magnitude or more . 
 since the main source of ionizing photons is o in the outer ejecta , the distributions of o and density in the outer ejecta need to be known precisely . 
 unfortunately , these regions in w7 have some problems to reproduce the observed optical spectra ( * ? ? ? 
 * and references therein ) . due to this uncertainty in the explosion model , 
 it is not conclusive if the companion star of tycho s sn will exhibit unique fe i absorption features discussed in this paper . 
 nevertheless , it is true that every sn ia has a period during which the companion star has the distinct absorption features discussed above because the ejecta become cool enough to have plenty of fe i for a time after the optical brightening . 
 second , it is assumed in our calculations that ions in the shocked region are ionized to fe@xmath16 , si@xmath17 , o@xmath18 , c@xmath19 immediately after the shock passes following the procedure taken by @xcite . 
 since ions in lower ionization stages are a strong source of ionizing photons , ionization may be more advanced in real young snrs .

 1993 , apj , 416 , 247","we propose a method to identify the companion stars of type ia supernovae ( sne ia ) in young supernova remnants ( snrs ) by recognizing distinct features of absorption lines due to fe i appearing in the spectrum . 
 if a sufficient amount of fe i remains in the ejecta , fe i atoms moving toward us absorb photons by transitions from the ground state to imprint broad absorption lines exclusively with the blue - shifted components in the spectrum of the companion star . to investigate the time evolution of column depth of fe i in the ejecta 
 , we have performed hydrodynamical calculations for snrs expanding into the uniform ambient media , taking into account collisional ionizations , excitations , and photo - ionizations of heavy elements . as a result 
 , it is found that the companion star in tycho s snr will exhibit observable features in absorption lines due to fe i at @xmath0 nm and 385.9911 nm if a carbon deflagration sn model @xcite is taken . 
 however , these features may disappear by taking another model that emits a few times more intense ionizing photons from the shocked outer layers . to further explore the ionization states in the freely expanding ejecta

"in the unification scheme of agn the difference between type 1 and type 2 agn is explained by angle - dependent circumnuclear obscuration of the accretion disk and broad - line region @xcite . this obscuring dusty medium 
 commonly referred to as `` dust torus ''  is optically and geometrically thick and probably extends from sub - parsec scales outward to several 10s of parsecs , or beyond for high luminosity objects . 
 the dust in the torus absorbs the incident uv / optical radiation an re - emits the received energy in the infrared 
 .    observations have shown that type 1 agn show significantly more emission in the near - ir than type 2 agn for the same given intrinsic luminosity ( e.g. * ? ? ? 
 this is consistent with the picture where the face - on view onto the torus in type 1 agn exposes the innermost hot dust to the observer . on the other hand in type 2 agn the torus 
 is seen edge - on so that internal obscuration blocks the line - of - sight to the hot dust . owing to this effect 
 , it is expected that for a given agn luminosity the infrared emission of type 1 agn is generally stronger than from type 2s .    in the light of attempts at forming isotropic agn samples based on ir fluxes it seems important to know exactly how strong of a bias towards type 1s over type 2s 
 may occur when invoking flux limits . 
 moreover , probing the wavelength dependence of this anisotropy in the infrared has some constraining power on our understanding of how the torus obscures the agn . it may be possible to distinguish torus models where the dust is smoothly distributed from those where the dust is arranged in clouds ( e.g. * ? ? ? 
 * ) : if the dust is smoothly distributed within the torus , a large degree of anisotropy is expected . 
 if , however , the dust is arranged in clouds the anisotropy is expected to be smaller . 
 a problem commonly encountered when studying agn samples in the local universe is a significant contribution of the host galaxy to the ir . 
 this is related to the typical lower luminosity seyfert galaxies which dominate the nearby agn population . 
 one way around this problem is the use of high - spatial resolution observations , as possible with the largest ground - based telescopes or interferometers , which are able to resolve out the host and isolate the agn emission ( for details see * ? ? ? 
 * ) . however , it is difficult to set up representative samples owing to the observational limitations . 
 another possibility is the use of high luminosity objects  typically at higher redshift  where the agn outshines the host galaxy by a large factor in the optical and near - ir . 
 if pah features are absent , the agn most likely dominates the mid - ir wavelength region as well ( in our sample : host @xmath4 for wavelengths @xmath5 17@xmath2 ) .    in this paper 
 we aim at quantifying the wavelength dependence of the anisotropy of the agn emission in the infrared from @xmath1 . for that we use a ( nearly ) isotropically selected and complete sample of quasars and radio galaxies with hidden quasars at @xmath0 as recently presented in @xcite and described in sect . 
 [ sec : sample ] . 
 here we improve the analysis by using host - galaxy subtraction for the radio galaxies and use clumpy torus models for interpretation . in sect . 
 [ sec : results ] we show the average seds of each of the subsamples which are representing obscured ( type 2 ) and unobscured ( type 1 ) agn . 
 we further analyze the origin of the anisotropy by fitting extinction models and clumpy torus models to the observations in sect . 
 [ sec : analysis ] . in sect . 
 [ sec : obsaniso ] we discuss our results by comparing them to previous ir anisotropy estimates in literature . 
 the results are summarized in sect . 
 [ sec : summary ] . 
 the object sample for this paper comprises all 3crr @xcite radio galaxies and quasars with @xmath6 this lobe dominated sample presents a well matched set of radio galaxies and quasars in terms of their intrinsic luminosity ( @xmath7erg / s for the quasars and @xmath8erg / s for the radio galaxies ; errors indicate standard deviation of the sample ) . 
 the data used here have been presented previously in @xcite and @xcite and we refer the reader to these papers for further details on the source selection , data reduction , and building of the average seds . to summarize briefly , we obtained mid - ir photometry in all six filters from 3.6@xmath2 to 24@xmath2 and spectroscopy from 19@xmath2 to 38@xmath2 utilizing all three instruments onboard the _ spitzer _ 
 space telescope @xcite . 
 after the data reduction in a standard manner , the individual source seds were interpolated onto a common rest frame wavelength grid . 
 the quasars and radio galaxies were then averaged into a mean sed for each class of objects . 
 the individual seds ( including observed and interpolated photometry ) as well as the the average seds are presented in ( * ? ? ? 
 * their figs.1 & 2 ) .    for this paper , additional corrections have been applied to the radio galaxy data before the averaging process outlined above : at the shortest wavelengths considered here ( @xmath9@xmath10 m , rest frame ) the radio galaxy seds show contributions from the host galaxy . 
 since we want to isolate the emission coming from the active nucleus , we have to correct for the stellar emission in these cases . 
 this correction was performed by fitting the observed irac photometry with a combination of a moderately old ( 5 - 10gyr ) elliptical galaxy sed to represent the stellar emission ( taken from the grasil webpage ; @xcite ) and a hot black body for the agn dust whose temperature we allowed to vary ( see e.g. * ? ? ? 
 * ; * ? ? ? 
 the resulting black body temperatures in the radio galaxies range from 600 to 970k , with a median value of 860k . 
 the fraction of host galaxy light contributing to the flux measured at the observed frame wavelengths 3.6 , 4.5 , 5.8 , and 8.0@xmath10 m was found to be 0.9 , 0.6 , 0.3 , and 0.1 , respectively . despite a negligible contribution from the host galaxy 
 , we performed similar fits to the quasar sample as well to obtain characteristics of the hot dust emission and compare it to the radio galaxies . 
 for the quasars we find notably hotter temperatures in the range from 8801250k ( median 1020k ) . 
 this is consistent with the idea that the hottest dust is obscured in radio galaxies , while directly seen in quasars . in the radio galaxies we then subtracted the estimated host galaxy contribution from the observed irac photometry using the scaled template sed . 
 for the irs and mips measurements the host galaxy contributions were considered negligible at restframe wavelength @xmath11 and no corrections have been applied . 
 we refrain from further corrections related to possible starformation . 
 as pointed out in @xcite neither the individual seds nor the averages showed any pah features ( see also fig . 
 [ fig : aver_sed ] ) , which indicates that any contribution from starformation to the mid - ir is probably negligible . 
 the radio galaxy 3c368 has a galactic m - star superimposed close to the position of the radio galaxy nucleus ( e.g. * ? ? ? 
 * ; * ? ? ? 
 both sources are partly blended even at the shortest irac wavelengths which makes the correction for the host galaxy emission in this source quite uncertain . 
 consequently , we removed this source from the sample considered here . 
 this leaves us with 11 quasars and 8 radio galaxies from which the average seds have been calculated . 
 in fig .  [ fig : aver_sed ] we show the average sed of @xmath13 quasars ( red ) and radio galaxies ( blue ) respectively . 
 the error bars reflect the mean absolute deviation while the shaded areas show the range of the respective subsample at each wavelength point of the interpolated data ( see sect . 
 [ sec : sample ] ) . for each of the object types we calculated a spline fit through the mean data points in order to guide the eye . 
 it is obvious that the radio galaxies are systematically lower in infrared emission than the quasars . 
 the discrepancy is largest in the near - ir and flattens out towards longer wavelengths . 
 @xcite showed similar average seds . 
 here we used additional host galaxy subtraction , which isolates the agn light much better ( see sect .  [ 
 sec : sample ] ) . 
 this is most obvious in the near - ir part of the radio galaxies shortward of 5@xmath2 . 
 the sed keeps on falling toward shorter wavelengths consistent with the wien tail from hot dust emission , instead of making an upward turn ( see * ? ? ? 
 since both types have the same radio luminosities due to our selection , this difference between quasars (= type 1 agn ) and radio galaxies (= type 2 agn ) is a generic property of the sample . 
 it either reflects a difference in line - of - sight extinction ( e.g. by cold dust in the host galaxy ) , or traces the anisotropy in re - emission of the agn - heated dust . 
 @xcite tested the former possibility and found a surprisingly good match of the difference between radio galaxies and quasars in the mid - ir by a single extinction law . 
 this , however , breaks down in the near - ir . in this paper 
 we will test if , instead , a single absorber and emitter (= the dust torus ) may be responsible for the radio galaxy / quasar anisotropy ( see sect . 
 [ sec : modcomp ] ) .    to quantify the wavelength dependence of the anisotropy we plot the quasar / radio galaxy ratio in fig . 
 [ fig : ratio ] . also shown is the mean absolute deviation of the ratio calculated by propagating the standard deviations of each subsample . from 2 to 8@xmath2 the emission ratio gradually decreases from 20 to 2 . in the silicate feature 
 this ratio increases again up to about 3 and flattens out towards 15@xmath2 at a value of @xmath14 . 
 our sample comprises a range of sed shapes , meaning that a range of ratios is observed . 
 most of this sample range comes from the radio galaxies which show much less uniformity than the quasars ( see fig . 
 [ sec : sample ] ) . 
 we illustrated the range of ratios covered by the radio galaxies in fig . 
 [ fig : range ] where we plot the wavelength dependence of the ratio of each radio galaxy using the average quasar sed and normalize it to 15@xmath2 .    at around 10@xmath2 
 the radio galaxies show the silicate feature in absorption while quasars display a weak silicate emission feature . 
 we used the spline fits described above ( see fig . 
 [ fig : aver_sed ] ) to locate the centers of the silicate features following the method outlined by @xcite . 
 the silicate absorption feature center is found to be at @xmath15 while the peak of the silicate emission feature was measured at @xmath16 . 
 this difference in central wavelength is similar to the ones observed in local galaxies . 
 as recent high spatial resolution studies of seyferts suggest , the `` shift '' in wavelength is not a pure radiative transfer effect due to the location or distribution of the dust , but implies a change of dust chemistry within the torus @xcite . 
 as demonstrated by @xcite the silicate emission feature may be located at around 10.5@xmath2 if a fraction of the hot silicate dust consists of porous silicate grains . 
 we note that the transition from quasars to radio galaxies is not as smooth as one may expect . in spite of some overlap in the range of seds of both types in the near - ir part in fig . 
 [ fig : aver_sed ] , quasars generally show infrared emission characteristics expected for a type 1 agn ( blue ir color ; silicate emission feature ) and radio galaxies have ir seds with type 2 emission properties ( redder sed ; silicate absorption feature ) . 
 in this section we analyze the scenarios that can lead to the observed anisotropy in radio galaxies and quasars . 
 there are two possibilities : ( 1 ) extinction by a cold dust screen and ( 2 ) absorption and emission in a warm dusty medium . 
 the former possibility may be associated with cold dust in the host galaxy while the latter one is equivalent to the dust torus in the agn unification scheme ( which we may call `` intrinsic anisotropy '' ) . 
 we will first discuss the plausibility and consequences of a cold dust screen on the seds . if the ir anisotropy is dominated by cold host galaxy dust 
 , then we have a situation where the ir emission originates from the torus while the absorption is coming from a different component ( i.e. dust in the host ) . 
 this means that we require an additional component outside the agn to model the data ( e.g. as used for a significant minority of high-@xmath17 type 2 qsos in @xcite ) . 
 however , the objects suffering extinction ( here : radio galaxies ) would be offset from quasars by only a single extinction law . 
 this has been tested and ruled out by @xcite for the same set of objects as presented here . in fig . 
 [ fig : ratio ] we show the anisotropy ratio between quasars and radio galaxies ( black circles with error bars ) . 
 we overplot a standard ism extinction curve , resembling cold screen extinction , scaled to the observed 15@xmath2 anisotropy ( dark - blue dotted line ; using a mixture of 53% silicates and 47% graphite , based on updated dust opacity cuves by @xcite , and a grain size distribution according to @xcite ) . 
 the extinction curve significantly overpredicts the anistropy in the silicate feature with better agreement in the near - ir . for reference we also plot the extinction curve based on ( 
 * light - blue dotted line ;  pixie dust  ) , as used in @xcite , which results in better agreement within the silicate feature but significant offsets in the near - ir . 
 in fact , @xcite pointed out that a good correspondence of quasars and radio galaxies can be achieved only if the quasar sed is attenuated by at least _ two _ instead of one extinction components  which is reminiscent of radiative transfer (= absorption _ and _ emission ) within the torus rather than a cold screen 
 .    moreover , we found a mean anisotropy of about 1.4 at 15@xmath2 ( see sect .  [ sec : results ] ) . 
 dust opacity curves typically have opacity ratios @xmath18 . in order to obtain the observed anisotropy 
 , the dust screen would have to have @xmath19 . 
 while such optical depth values are in reach for galactic dust lanes ( e.g. extinction towards our own galactic center ) , it requires very edge - on views onto disk galaxies since the scale height of galactic disks is small . on statistical grounds 
 this possibility may be viable for a minority of all radio galaxies , but it is unlikely that the whole population is dominated by host extinction . 
 we note that the same line of argument can be made using the near - ir anisotropy leading to even higher @xmath20 and illustrating the need for more then just one cold extinction screen in this scenario . 
 we use our clumpy torus models _ cat3d _ 
 @xcite to test if the observed anisotropy ratio can be explained by the intrinsic anisotropy as predicted in the unification scheme . 
 generally smooth dust torus models predict stronger anisotropy than clumpy models @xcite . 
 @xcite argue that the observed small anisotropy in the mid - ir / x - ray correlation ( see sect . 
 [ sec : obsaniso ] ) is qualitatively in agreement with a clumpy torus . 
 here we aim at being more quantitative and show consistency of the observed anisotropy with torus orientation .    in fig . 
 [ fig : ratio ] we overplot the observed ratio with predicted ratios of a clumpy torus model ( red dashed line ) . as mean torus inclination in quasars 
 we assumed 39@xmath21 while the mean radio galaxy inclination is set to 75@xmath21 . 
 this corresponds to a mean opening angle of the torus of 60@xmath21 or a type 1/type 2 ratio of 1:1 , which is consistent with the number statistics of our complete and isotropic sample @xcite . 
 [ fig : ratio ] shows that the model is following the continuum anisotropy curve quite well . 
 there is , however , a slight deviation within the silicate feature where in the center of the feature the model curve predicts slightly lower anisotropy than shown by the observed curve . 
 this may be indicative of additional , off - torus obscuration in some objects ( e.g. from the host galaxy ) , which effectively deepens silicate absorption features in radio galaxies ( the denominator of the plot in fig . 
 [ fig : ratio ] ) and , to a lesser degree , changes the spectral slope . 
 if this happens in individual objects , the average curve and scatter will tend to be slightly more anisotropic . 
 some local examples of host obscuration are centaurus a , ngc  5506 , or the nucleus of the circinus galaxy where host - galactic dust lanes are projected onto the nucleus producing deep silicate features . 
 in fact the silicate absorption feature in the average radio galaxy sed seems to be deeper than in typical local seyfert 2 galaxies without host obscuration @xcite . 
 note that this requires a statistical alignment of cold host dust with that of the torus ( see sect . 
 [ sec : extinct ] ) . 
 the model used for reproducing the ratio uses a dust cloud distribution with radial power law @xmath22 and 5 clouds along the line - of - sight in equatorial direction ( for details see * ? ? ? 
 * ) . in comparison 
 to models for seds and mid - ir interferometry of local seyfert galaxies , these parameters suggest only a slightly more centrally condensed and transparent torus @xcite , while the half - opening angle may be wider ( 60@xmath21 instead of 45@xmath21 ) . 
 in fact a range of torus model parameters satisfies the observed type 1/type 2 anisotropy spectrum within the error bars of the sample ( e.g. various steeper and shallower dust distributions ) . from bayesian inference analysis we found that the torus model parameters are generally poorly constrained ( broad posterior distributions for individual parameters ) . 
 a weakness is certainly that modeling the flux ratio is not very constraining for model parameters since it does only take relative fluxes into account , while absolute fluxes ( e.g. actual silicate strength of type 1s or type 2s ) are not included . on the other hand , what the modeling shows is that the observed small ratios at long wavelengths and the change of anisotropy from the near- to the mid - ir are in agreement with expectations from clumpy torus models without fine - tuning parameters .    in summary , the torus model seems to reproduce the observed anisotropy reasonably well over most of the wavelength range , while single extinction laws result in much worse fits . 
 the model parameters used in the clumpy torus model fit are reasonable in comparison to fits to local agn . 
 it demonstrates plausibility of the scenario that the anisotropy is related to torus orientation . 
 this strongly suggests that the observed anisotropy is a measure for the intrinsic anisotropy of luminous type 1 and type 2 agn at @xmath12 . 
 in sect .  [ sec : analysis ] we argued that the observed ir anisotropy is probably reflecting the `` intrinsic anisotropy '' as caused by the dust torus . 
 the isotropic and complete selection of the sample helps to minimize any biasing effects on the anisotropy . on the other hand , optically- and 
 x - ray - selected samples often suffer from missing some of the most obscured objects . 
 moreover , since the ratio is @xmath23 at 15@xmath2 , flux - limited mid - ir selected samples are potentially biased towards type 1 agn as well . 
 thus , even using 12@xmath2-selected agn samples will slightly suffer from the assumption of isotropy . 
 one popular way of comparing type 1s and type 2s is the correlation between x - ray and mid - ir luminosity . in case 
 the x - luminosity is emitted isotropically ( and traces the dust - heating emission ) , and the mid - ir emission is radiated very anisotropically , this correlation is expected to be different for type 1 and type 2 agn . however , using high spatial resolution observations @xcite showed that local seyfert 1 and seyfert 2 galaxies , up to column densities of few @xmath24 @xmath25 , essentially follow the same correlation . 
 a conservative estimate suggests that at 12@xmath2 the difference between both types is smaller than a factor of 3 . despite including some `` mildly '' compton - thick objects in this study 
 , the most obscured objects are still missing due to the lack of intrinsic x - ray data . 
 this essentially makes anisotropy estimates from the mid - ir / x - ray - correlation a lower limit on the `` true '' anisotropy . 
 nevertheless this result is fully consistent with our finding for powerful @xmath12 agn . at 12@xmath2 
 we find a type 1/type 2 ratio of @xmath26 . assuming that x - ray selection misses the highest - inclination objects our result would predict that the anisotropy in the mid - ir / x - ray correlation is @xmath27 , at least for powerful agn as presented here . 
 @xcite used a sample of local seyfert galaxies and compared the average 535@xmath2 sed of type 1s and type 2s , scaled to their respective 8.4ghz emission . 
 however since the sources have been selected according to a flux limit at 12@xmath2 , the sample can not be considered isotropic . 
 @xcite report generally higher fluxes for type seyfert 1 agn as compared to seyfert 2s . 
 the anisotropy decreases from a factor of about 8 to @xmath32.5 from 5 to 8@xmath2 . 
 this is significantly larger than what we find for our isotropically selected radio - loud sample . at longer wavelengths the seyfert 1/seyfert 2 ratio of @xcite flattens to about a factor of 23 ( with no convergence to unity as expected at long wavelengths ) which is , again , larger than what we found . 
 the discrepancy between our results and @xcite may be either due to ( 1 ) the different selection criteria chosen , ( 2 ) a difference between low and high luminosity agn , or ( 3 ) a difference between radio - quiet and radio - loud agn . while the data in @xcite has not been corrected for host galaxy , the contribution by starformation should not be significant given the lack of pah features in the average spectrum . 
 if a host - correction were applied , it would predominantly affect type 2 agn , thus making the anisotropy even larger . 
 furthermore , if the mid - ir selection had any effect , then the sample would miss out agn at highest obscuration , so that the real type 1/type 2 anisotropy would again be larger . in conclusion 
 , possible selection effects and host contamination in the @xcite study would tend to result in an underestimated anisotropy , making the difference to our findings even stronger . 
 it is well possible that the difference in anisotropy between our high - luminosity radio - loud sample and the low - luminosity radio - quiet sample is real . 
 this would imply that either luminosity or radio power are the drivers for the observed characteristics . 
 radio jets are highly collimated so that any influence of the jet can be expected perpendicular to the torus plane and just in a very small solid angle . 
 it is , therefore , more reasonable to assume that the higher agn luminosity would cause the lower anisotropy than the jet . 
 the classical receding torus picture changes the opening angle of the torus for higher luminosity ( e.g. * ? ? ? 
 * ; * ? ? ? 
 this mainly affects the relative number of type 1s and type 2s in a sample . 
 the relatively high fraction of about 50% unobscured agn in our sample would support this scenario . 
 however , to change the anisotropy between both types , it would be necessary to also change the obscuration properties ( i.e. type 2s must on average look more like type 1s ) . 
 such a scenario of `` radiation - limited obscuration '' has been proposed by @xcite and supported by observations of @xcite . in this case about the same effect is expected for radio - quiet and radio - loud agn . 
 we use the sample of quasars and radio galaxies at @xmath12 recently presented in @xcite . since the sample was selected isotropically 
 , it should cover all torus inclination angles ( weighted by solid angle ) . 
 for these objects an infrared 117@xmath2 restframe sed has been constructed . 
 average seds were calculated for the quasar (= type 1 agn ) and radio galaxy (= type 2 agn ) samples , respectively , in order to study the intrinsic anisotropy of the ir emission of the dust torus . 
 it is shown that the ratio between type 1 and type 2 agn in our parameter space of very luminous radio galaxies , the value gradually decreases from 20 to 2 at wavelengths 2 to 8@xmath2 . within the 10@xmath2 silicate feature the ratio raises slightly . at longer wavelength 
 the mid - ir emission becomes more isotropic . 
 the intrinsic ratio between our type 1 and type 2 agn is @xmath14 at 15@xmath2 . when using ir - selected flux - limited samples this anisotropy has to be taken into account . 
 by analyzing the silicate feature in the sample averages we find the well - established `` shift '' of the central peak of the silicate emission feature with respect to the center of the absorption feature . 
 the resulting central wavelengths at @xmath15 for the absorption and @xmath16 for the emission feature are in agreement with previous reports ( e.g. * ? ? ? 
 * ; * ? ? ? 
 we discussed our results in the frame of other anisotropy estimators . 
 our findings are consistent with upper limits derived from the x - ray / mid - ir correlation of local seyfert galaxies @xcite . 
 some discrepancy exists with respect to a similar study of @xcite for nearby seyferts . 
 if real it would imply that nearby , radio - quiet lower - luminosity agn show a higher degree of anisotropy in the ir than higher luminosity , radio - loud sources . 
 this may be explained by a receding torus model with luminosity - dependent obscuration . 
 we also show that the overall relatively small degree of anisotropy is consistent with the torus being clumpy rather than smooth . 
 our clumpy torus model reproduces the observed type 1/type 2 ratio reasonably well .

 2004 , apjs , 154 , 1","we use restframe near- and mid - ir data of an isotropically selected sample of quasars and radio galaxies at @xmath0 , which have been published previously , to study the wavelength - dependent anisotropy of the ir emission . for 
 that we build average seds of the quasar subsample (= type 1 agn ) and radio galaxies (= type 2 agn ) from @xmath1 and plot the ratio of both average samples . from 2 to 8@xmath2 restframe wavelength 
 the ratio gradually decreases from 20 to 2 with values around 3 in the 10@xmath2 silicate feature . 
 longward of 12@xmath2 the ratio decreases further and shows some high degree of isotropy at 15@xmath2 ( ratio @xmath31.4 ) . 
 the results are consistent with upper limits derived from the x - ray / mid - ir correlation of local seyfert galaxies . 
 we find that the anisotropy in our high - luminosity radio - loud sample is smaller than in radio - quiet lower - luminosity agn which may be interpreted in the framework of a receding torus model with luminosity - dependent obscuration properties . 
 it is also shown that the relatively small degree of anisotropy is consistent with clumpy torus models .",arxiv
"the goal of the development of the code was to have a simple and efficient tool for the computation of adiabatic oscillation frequencies and eigenfunctions for general stellar models , emphasizing also the accuracy of the results . 
 not surprisingly , given the long development period , the simplicity is now less evident . 
 however , the code offers considerable flexibility in the choice of integration method as well as ability to determine all frequencies of a given model , in a given range of degree and frequency . 
 the choice of variables describing the equilibrium model and oscillations was to a large extent inspired by @xcite . 
 as discussed in section  [ sec : eqmodel ] the equilibrium model is defined in terms of a minimal set of dimensionless variables , as well as by mass and radius of the model . 
 fairly extensive documentation of the code , on which the present paper in part is based , is provided with the distribution packagejcd / adipack.n ] . 
 @xcite provided an extensive review of adiabatic stellar oscillations , emphasizing applications to helioseismology , and discussed many aspects and tests of the aarhus package , whereas @xcite carried out careful tests and comparisons of results on polytropic models ; this includes extensive tables of frequencies which can be used for comparison with other codes . 
 the equilibrium model is defined in terms of the following dimensionless variables : @xmath0 here @xmath1 is distance to the centre , @xmath2 is the mass interior to @xmath1 , @xmath3 is the photospheric radius of the model and @xmath4 is its mass ; also , @xmath5 is the gravitational constant , @xmath6 is pressure , @xmath7 is density , and @xmath8 , the derivative being at constant specific entropy . 
 in addition , the model file defines @xmath4 and @xmath3 , as well as central pressure and density , in dimensional units , and scaled second derivatives of @xmath6 and @xmath7 at the centre ( required from the expansions in the central boundary condition ) ; finally , for models with vanishing surface pressure , assuming a polytropic relation between @xmath6 and @xmath7 in the near - surface region , the polytropic index is specified . 
 the following relations between the variables defined here and more `` physical '' variables are often useful : @xmath9 we may also express the characteristic frequencies for adiabatic oscillations in terms of these variables . thus if @xmath10 is the buoyancy frequency , @xmath11 is the lamb frequency at degree @xmath12 and @xmath13 is the acoustical cut - off frequency for an isothermal atmosphere , we have @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the adiabatic sound speed , and @xmath16 is the pressure scale height , @xmath17 being the gravitational acceleration . 
 finally it may be noted that the squared sound speed is given by @xmath18 these equations also define the dimensionless characteristic frequencies @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 as well as the dimensionless sound speed @xmath22 , which are often useful .      as is well known the displacement vector of nonradial ( spheroidal ) modes 
 can be written in terms of polar coordinates @xmath23 as @xmath24 \exp ( - { { \rm i}}\omega t ) \right\ } \ ; . \nonumber\end{aligned}\ ] ] here @xmath25 is a spherical harmonic of degree @xmath12 and azimuthal order @xmath2 , @xmath26 being co - latitude and @xmath27 longitude ; @xmath28 is an associated legendre function , and @xmath29 is a suitable normalization constant . 
 also , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and @xmath32 are unit vectors in the @xmath1 , @xmath26 , and @xmath27 directions . finally , @xmath33 is time and @xmath34 is the angular frequency of the mode . 
 similarly , e.g. , the eulerian perturbation to pressure may be written @xmath35 \ ; . \label{eq : e2.2}\ ] ] as the oscillations are adiabatic ( and only conservative boundary conditions are considered ) @xmath34 is real , and the amplitude functions @xmath36 , 
 @xmath37 , @xmath38 , etc . can be chosen to be real . 
 the equations of adiabatic stellar oscillations , in the nonradial case , are expressed in terms of the following variables : , @xmath39 results from the earlier use of an unconventional sign convention for @xmath40 ; now , as usual , @xmath40 is defined such that the perturbed poisson equation has the form @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is the eulerian density perturbation . ] 
 @xmath43 here @xmath40 is the perturbation to the gravitational potential . also , we introduce the dimensionless frequency @xmath44 by @xmath45 corresponding to eqs [ eq : buoy ]  [ eq : cutoff ] . these quantities satisfy the following equations : @xmath46   y_1 + ( a - 1 )   y_2 + \eta a   y_3 \ ; , \\ \label{eq : ea.3 } x   { { { \rm d}}y_3   \over { { \rm d}}x } & = & y_3 + y_4 \ ; , \\ \label{eq : ea.4 } x   { { { \rm d}}y_4   \over { { \rm d}}x } & = & - a u   y_1    - u { v_g    \over \eta } y_2 \\ & & + [ l ( l + 1 ) + u(a - 2 ) +   u v_g ]   y_3 + 2(1 - u )   y_4 \ ; . \nonumber\end{aligned}\ ] ] here @xmath47 , and the notation is otherwise as defined in eq . 
 [ eq : fivea ] . in the @xcite approximation , where the perturbation to the gravitational potential is neglected , 
 the terms in @xmath48 are neglected in eqs  [ eq : ea.1 ] and [ eq : ea.2 ] and eqs  [ eq : ea.3 ] and [ eq : ea.4 ] are not used . 
 the dependent variables @xmath49 in the nonradial case have been chosen in such a way that for @xmath50 they all vary as @xmath51 for @xmath52 . for large @xmath12 a considerable ( and fundamentally unnecessary ) computational effort 
 would be needed to represent this variation sufficiently accurately with , e.g. , a finite difference technique , if these variables were to be used in the numerical integration . 
 instead i introduce a new set of dependent variables by @xmath53 these variables are then @xmath54 in @xmath55 near the centre . 
 they are used in the region where the variation in the @xmath56 is dominated by the @xmath51 behaviour , for @xmath57 , say , where @xmath58 is determined on the basis of the asymptotic properties of the solution . this transformation permits calculating modes of arbitrarily high degree in a complete model . for radial oscillations only @xmath59 and @xmath60 
 are used , where @xmath59 is defined as above , and @xmath61 here the equations become @xmath62 y_1 + a   y_2 \ ; . \label{eq : ea.6}\end{aligned}\ ] ]    the equations are solved on the interval @xmath63 $ ] in @xmath55 . here , 
 in the most common case involving a complete stellar model @xmath64 , where @xmath65 is a suitably small number such that the series expansion around @xmath66 is sufficiently accurate ; however , the code can also deal with envelope models with arbitrary @xmath67 , typically imposing @xmath68 at the bottom of the envelope . 
 the outermost point is defined by @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the surface radius , including the atmosphere ; thus , typically , @xmath71 . 
 the centre of the star , @xmath72 , is obviously a singular point of the equations . 
 as discussed , e.g. , by @xcite boundary conditions at this point are obtained from a series expansion , in the present code to second significant order . in the general case 
 this defines two conditions at the innermost non - zero point in the model . for radial oscillations , or nonradial oscillations in the cowling approximation 
 , one condition is obtained . 
 the surface in a realistic model is typically defined at a suitable point in the stellar atmosphere , with non - zero pressure and density . here 
 the simple condition of vanishing lagrangian pressure perturbation is implemented and sometimes used . 
 however , more commonly a condition between pressure perturbation and displacement is established by matching continuously to the solution in an isothermal atmosphere extending continuously from the uppermost point in the model . 
 a very similar condition was presented by @xcite . in addition , in the full nonradial case a condition is obtained from the continuous match of @xmath40 and its derivative to the vacuum solution outside the star .    in full polytropic models , or other models with vanishing surface pressure , the surface is also a singular point . in this case 
 a boundary condition at the outermost non - singular point is obtained from a series expansion , assuming a near - surface polytropic behaviour ( see * ? ? ? * for details ) . 
 the code also has the option of considering truncated ( e.g. , envelope ) models although at the moment only in the cowling approximation or for radial oscillations . in this case 
 the innermost boundary condition is typically the vanishing of the radial displacement @xmath73 although other options are available . 
 the numerical problem can be formulated generally as that of solving @xmath74 with the boundary conditions @xmath75 @xmath76 here the order @xmath77 of the system is 4 for the full nonradial case , and 2 for radial oscillations or nonradial oscillations in the cowling approximation . 
 this system only allows non - trivial solutions for selected values of @xmath78 which is thus an eigenvalue of the problem . 
 the programme permits solving these equations with two basically different techniques , each with some variants . 
 the first is a shooting method , where solutions satisfying the boundary conditions are integrated separately from the inner and outer boundary , and the eigenvalue is found by matching these solutions at a suitable inner fitting point @xmath79 . 
 the second technique is to solve the equations together with a normalization condition and all boundary conditions using a relaxation technique ; the eigenvalue is then found by requiring continuity of one of the eigenfunctions at an interior matching point . 
 for simplicity i do not distinguish between @xmath80 and @xmath56 ( cf . section  [ sec : eq ] ) in this section . 
 it is implicitly understood that the dependent variable ( which is denoted @xmath56 ) is @xmath80 for @xmath57 and @xmath56 for @xmath81 . 
 the numerical treatment of the transition between @xmath80 and @xmath56 has required a little care in the coding . 
 it is convenient here to distinguish between @xmath77 = 2 and @xmath77 = 4 . for @xmath77 = 2 the differential eqs  [ eq : e3.1 ] 
 have a unique ( apart from normalization ) solution @xmath82 satisfying the inner boundary conditions [ eq : e3.2 ] , and a unique solution @xmath83 satisfying the outer boundary conditions [ eq : e3.3 ] . 
 these are obtained by numerical integration of the equations . 
 the final solution can then be represented as @xmath84 . 
 the eigenvalue is obtained by requiring that the solutions agree at a suitable matching point @xmath85 , say . 
 thus @xmath86 these equations clearly have a non - trivial solution @xmath87 only when their determinant vanishes , i.e. , when @xmath88 equation [ eq : e3.5 ] is therefore the eigenvalue equation . 
 for @xmath77 = 4 there are two linearly independent solutions satisfying the inner boundary conditions , and two linearly independent solutions satisfying the outer boundary conditions . 
 the former set @xmath89 is chosen by setting @xmath90 and the latter set @xmath91 is chosen by setting @xmath92 the inner and outer boundary conditions are such that , given @xmath59 and @xmath48 , @xmath60 and @xmath39 may be calculated from them ; thus eqs  [ eq : e3.6 ] and [ eq : e3.7 ] completely specify the solutions , which are obtained by integrating from the inner or outer boundary . 
 the final solution can then be represented as @xmath93 at the fitting point @xmath79 continuity of the solution requires that @xmath94 this set of equations only has a non - trivial solution if @xmath95 where , e.g. , @xmath96 . 
 thus eq . 
 [ eq : e3.9 ] is the eigenvalue equation in this case . 
 clearly @xmath97 as defined in either eq . 
 [ eq : e3.5 ] or eq . 
 [ eq : e3.9 ] is a smooth function of @xmath78 , and the eigenfrequencies are found as the zeros of this function . 
 this is done in the programme using a standard secant technique . 
 however , the programme also has the option for scanning through a given interval in @xmath78 to look for changes of sign of @xmath97 , possibly iterating for the eigenfrequency at each change of sign . 
 thus it is possible to search a given region of the spectrum completely automatically . 
 the programme allows the use of two different techniques for solving the differential equations . 
 one is the standard second - order centred difference technique , where the differential equations are replaced by the difference equations @xmath98 
 , \quad i = 1 , \ldots , i \ ; . 
 \label{eq : e3.11}\ ] ] here i have introduced a mesh @xmath99 in @xmath55 , where @xmath10 is the total number of mesh points ; @xmath100 , and @xmath101 . 
 these equations allow the solution at @xmath102 to be determined from the solution at @xmath103 . 
 the second technique was proposed by @xcite ; here on each mesh interval @xmath104 we consider the equations @xmath105 with constant coefficients , where @xmath106 . 
 these equations may be solved analytically on the mesh intervals , and the complete solution is obtained by continuous matching at the mesh points . 
 this technique clearly permits the computation of solutions varying arbitrarily rapidly , i.e. , the calculation of modes of arbitrarily high order . on the other hand solving eqs  [ eq : e3.12 ] involves finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the coefficient matrix , and therefore becomes very complex and time consuming for higher - order systems . 
 thus in practice it has only been implemented for systems of order 2 , i.e. , radial oscillations or nonradial oscillations in the cowling approximation . 
 if one of the boundary conditions is dropped , the difference equations , with the remaining boundary condition and a normalization condition , constitute a set of linear equations for the @xmath107 which can be solved for any value of @xmath44 ; this set may be solved efficiently by forward elimination and backsubstitution ( e.g. , * ? ? ? 
 * ) , with a procedure very similar to the so - called henyey technique ( e.g. , * ? ? 
 * see also christensen - dalsgaard 2007 ) used in stellar modelling . 
 the eigenvalue is then found by requiring that the remaining boundary condition , which effectively takes the role of @xmath108 , be satisfied . 
 however , as both boundaries , at least in a complete model , are either singular or very nearly singular , the removal of one of the boundary conditions tends to produce solutions that are somewhat ill - behaved , in particular for modes of high degree . 
 this in turn is reflected in the behaviour of @xmath97 as a function of @xmath44 . 
 this problem is avoided in a variant of the relaxation technique where the difference equations are solved separately for @xmath109 and @xmath110 , by introducing a double point @xmath111 in the mesh . the solution is furthermore required to satisfy the boundary conditions [ eq : e3.2 ] and [ eq : e3.3 ] , a suitable normalization condition ( e.g. @xmath112 ) , and continuity of all but one of the variables at @xmath85 , e.g. , @xmath113 ( when @xmath77 = 2 clearly only the first continuity condition is used ) we then set @xmath114 and the eigenvalues are found as the zeros of @xmath97 , regarded as a function of @xmath78 . with this definition 
 , @xmath97 may have singularities with discontinuous sign changes that are not associated with an eigenvalue , and hence a little care is required in the search for eigenvalues . 
 however , close to an eigenvalue @xmath97 is generally well - behaved , and the secant iteration may be used without problems .    as implemented here 
 the shooting technique is considerably faster than the relaxation technique , and so should be used whenever possible ( notice that both techniques may use the difference eqs  [ eq : e3.11 ] and so they are numerically equivalent , in regions of the spectrum where they both work ) . for _ second - order systems _ the shooting technique can probably always be used ; the integrations of the inner and outer solutions should cause no problems , and the matching determinant in eq . 
 [ eq : e3.5 ] is well - behaved . for _ fourth - order systems _ 
 , however , this needs not be the case . for modes where the perturbation to the gravitational potential has little effect on the solution , the two solutions @xmath115 and @xmath116 , and similarly the two solutions @xmath117 and @xmath118 , are almost linearly dependent , and so the matching determinant nearly vanishes for any value of @xmath78 . 
 this is therefore the situation where the relaxation technique may be used with advantage . 
 this applies , in particular , to the calculation of modes of moderate and high degree which are essential to helioseismology .      to make full use of the increasingly accurate observed frequencies the computed frequencies should clearly at the very least match the observational accuracy , for a given model . only in this way 
 do the frequencies provide a faithful representation of the properties of the model , in comparisons with the observations 
 . however , since the numerical errors in the computed frequencies are typically highly systematic , they may affect the asteroseismic inferences even if they are smaller than the random errors in the observations , and hence more stringent requirements should be imposed on the computations . 
 also , the fact that solar - like oscillations , and several other types of asteroseismically interesting modes , tend to be of high radial order complicates reaching the required precision . 
 the numerical techniques discussed so far are generally of second order . 
 this yields insufficient precision in the evaluation of the eigenfrequencies , unless a very dense mesh is used in the computation ( see also * ? ? ? 
 the code may apply two techniques to improve the precision . 
 one technique ( cf . 
 * ) uses the fact that the frequency approximately satisfies a variational principle @xcite . 
 the variational expression may formally be written as @xmath119 where @xmath120 and @xmath121 are integrals over the equilibrium model depending on the eigenfunction , here represented by @xmath122 . 
 the variational property implies that any error @xmath123 in @xmath122 induces an error in @xmath124 that is @xmath125 . 
 thus by substituting the computed eigenfunction into the variational expression a more precise determination of @xmath78 should result . 
 this has indeed been confirmed @xcite . 
 the second technique uses explicitly that the difference scheme [ eq : e3.11 ] , which is used by one version of the shooting technique , and the relaxation technique , is of second order . consequently the truncation errors in the eigenfrequency and eigenfunction scale as @xmath126 . 
 if @xmath127 and @xmath128 are the eigenfrequencies obtained from solutions with @xmath129 and @xmath10 meshpoints , the leading - order error term therefore cancels in @xmath130 \ ; . \label{eq : e3.18}\ ] ] this procedure , known as _ richardson extrapolation _ , was used by @xcite . 
 it provides an estimate of the eigenfrequency that is substantially more accurate than @xmath131 , although of course at some added computational expense . 
 indeed , since the error in the representation [ eq : e3.11 ] depends only on even powers of @xmath132 , the leading term of the error in @xmath133 is @xmath134 .    even with these techniques 
 the precision of the computed frequencies may be inadequate if the mesh used in stellar - evolution calculations is used also for the computation of the oscillations . 
 the number of meshpoints is typically relatively modest and the distribution may not reflect the requirement to resolve properly the eigenfunctions of the modes . 
 @xcite discussed techniques to redistribute the mesh in a way that takes into account the asymptotic behaviour of the eigenfunctions ; a code to do so , based on four - point lagrangian interpolation , is included in the adipls distribution package . 
 on the other hand , for computing low - order modes ( as are typically relevant for , say , @xmath135 scuti or @xmath136 cephei stars ) , the original mesh of the evolution calculation may be adequate . 
 it is difficult to provide general recommendations concerning the required number of points or the need for redistribution , since this depends strongly on the types of modes and the properties of the stellar model . 
 it is recommended to carry out experiments varying the number and distribution of points to obtain estimates of the intrinsic precision of the computation ( e.g. , * ? ? ? 
 * ; * ? ? ? 
 in the latter case , considering simple polytropic models , it was found that 4801 points yielded a relative precision substantially better than @xmath137 for high - order p modes , when richardson extrapolation was used .    in the discussion of the frequency calculation it is important to distinguish between _ precision _ and _ accuracy _ , 
 the latter obviously referring to the extent to which the computed frequencies represent what might be considered the ` true ' frequencies of the model . 
 in particular , the manipulations required to derive eq .  [ eq : varprinc ] and to demonstrate its variational property depend on the equation of hydrostatic support being satisfied . 
 if this is not the case , as might well happen in an insufficiently careful stellar model calculation , the value determined from the variational principle may be quite precise , in the sense of numerically stable , but still unacceptably far from the correct value . 
 indeed , a comparison between @xmath138 and @xmath133 provides some measure of the reliability of the computed frequencies ( e.g. * ? ? ? 
 the programme finds the order of the mode according to the definition developed by @xcite and @xcite , based on earlier work by @xcite . 
 specifically , the order is defined by @xmath139 here the sum is over the zeros @xmath140 in @xmath59 ( excluding the centre ) , and @xmath141 is the sign function , @xmath142 if @xmath143 and @xmath144 if @xmath145 . for a complete model that includes the centre @xmath146 for radial oscillations and @xmath147 for nonradial oscillations . 
 thus the lowest - order radial oscillation has order @xmath148 . 
 although this is contrary to the commonly used convention of assigning order 0 to the fundamental radial oscillation , the convention used here is in fact the more reasonable , in the sense that it ensures that @xmath149 is invariant under a continuous variation of @xmath12 from 0 to 1 . with this definition @xmath150 for p modes , @xmath151 for f modes , and @xmath152 for g modes , at least in simple models . 
 it has been found that this procedure has serious problems for dipolar modes in centrally condensed models ( e.g. , * ? ? ? 
 * ; * ? ? ? 
 * ; * ? ? ? 
 the eigenfunctions @xmath59 are shifted such that nodes disappear or otherwise provide spurious results when eq . 
 [ eq : e4.1 ] is used to determine the mode order . a procedure that does not suffer from this difficulty has recently been developed by @xcite 
 ; i discuss it further in section  [ sec : develop ] .    a powerful measure of the characteristics of a mode is provided by the _ normalized inertia_. the code calculates this as @xmath153   \rho   r^2   { { \rm d}}r \over    m [ \xi_r ( r_{\rm phot } ) ^2 + l(l+1 ) { \xi_{\rm h}}(r_{\rm phot } ) ^2 ] } \nonumber \\    & = & { \int_{x_1}^{{x_{\rm s } } } \left [ y_1 ^ 2    + y_2 ^ 2   / l ( l + 1 ) \right ]   q u { { \rm d}}x / x    \over 4 \pi [ y_1 ( x_{\rm phot } ) ^2 + y_2 ( x_{\rm phot } ) ^2/l(l+1 ) ] } \ ; .\end{aligned}\ ] ] ( for radial modes the terms in @xmath60 are not included . ) here @xmath154 and @xmath155 are the distance of the innermost mesh point from the centre and the surface radius , respectively , and @xmath156 is the fractional photospheric radius . 
 the normalization at the photosphere is to some extent arbitrary , of course , but reflects the fact that many radial - velocity observations use lines formed relatively deep in the atmosphere . 
 a more common definition of the inertia is @xmath157 where @xmath158 is the so - called _ 
 mode mass_.    the code has the option to output the eigenfunctions , in the form of @xmath159 . 
 in addition ( or instead ) the displacement eigenfunctions can be output in a form indicating the region where the mode predominantly resides , in an energetical sense , as @xmath160 ( for radial modes only @xmath161 is found ) . 
 these are defined in such a way that @xmath162   { { \rm d}}x / x      \over 4 \pi [ y_1 ( x_{\rm phot } ) ^2 + y_2 ( x_{\rm phot } ) ^2/l(l+1 ) ] } \ ; . \label{eq : e4.4}\ ] ] the form provided by the @xmath163 is also convenient , e.g. , for computing rotational splittings @xmath164 ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) , where @xmath165 is the frequency of a mode of radial order @xmath149 , degree @xmath12 and azimuthal order @xmath2 . for slow rotation 
 the splittings are obtained from first - order perturbation analysis as @xmath166 characterized by _ kernels _ 
 @xmath167 , where in general the angular velocity @xmath168 depends on both @xmath1 and @xmath26 . 
 the code has built in the option to compute kernels for first - order rotational splitting in the special case where @xmath168 depends only on @xmath1 . 
 several revisions of the code have been implemented in preliminary form or are under development . 
 a substantial improvement in the numerical solution of the oscillation equations , particularly for high - order modes , is the installation of a fourth - order integration scheme , based on the algorithm of @xcite . 
 this is essentially operational but has so far not been carefully tested . 
 comparisons with the results of the variational expression and the use of richardson extrapolation , of the same formal order , will be particularly interesting .    as discussed by @xcite the use of @xmath169 ( or , as here , @xmath170 ) as one of the integration variables has the disadvantage that the quantity @xmath171 enters into the oscillation equations . 
 in models with a density discontinuity , such as results if the model has a growing convective core and diffusion is neglected , @xmath171 has a delta - function singularity at the point of the discontinuity . in the adipls calculations this 
 is dealt with by replacing the discontinuity by a very steep and well - resolved slope . 
 however , it would obviously be an advantage to avoid this problem altogether . this can be achieved by using instead the lagrangian pressure perturbation @xmath172 as one of the variables . 
 implementing this option would be a relatively straightforward modification to the code and is under consideration . 
 the proper classification of dipolar modes of low order in centrally condensed models has been a long - standing problem in the theory of stellar pulsations , as discussed in section  [ sec : results ] . 
 such a scheme must provide a unique order for each mode , such that the order is invariant under continuous changes of the equilibrium model , e.g. , as a result of stellar evolution . as a major breakthrough , takata in a series of papers has elucidated important properties of these modes and defined a new classification scheme satisfying this requirement @xcite . 
 a preliminary version of this scheme has been implemented and tested ; however , the latest and most convenient form of the takata classification still needs to be installed . 
 a version of the code has been established which computes the first - order rotational splitting for a given rotation profile @xmath173 , in addition to setting up the corresponding kernels . 
 this is being extended by k. burke , sheffield , to cover also second - order effects of rotation , based on the formalism of @xcite . 
 an important motivation for this is the integration , discussed by @xcite , of the pulsation calculation with the astec evolution code to allow full calculation of oscillation frequencies for a model of specified parameters ( mass , age , initial rotation rate , etc . ) as the result of a single subroutine call .

"an important manifestation of the activity inside the disks of gas - rich galaxies is their highly structured hi distribution , marked by cavities , shells and supershells . 
 first discovered in the milky way ( heiles 1979 , 1984 ) , such features are now known to exist in a number of spiral galaxies ( e.g. lehnert & heckman 1996 , irwin & seaquist 1990 , puche et al . 
 1992 , brinks & bajaja 1986 ) . 
 exceptionally huge hi arcs and loops extending across several kiloparsecs have been identified with greater clarity in the hi images of a number of edge - on spirals , such as ngc  5775 ( irwin 1994 ) , ngc  4631 ( rand & van der hulst 1993 ) , ngc  3044 ( lee & irwin 1997 , hereafter li97 ) and ngc  3556 ( m 108 , king & irwin 1997 , hereafter ki97 ) . these have been interpreted as expanding supershells because of a loop - like or circular appearance in projection and either a persistence over a wide velocity range or , in a few cases , as some evidence for expansion in position - velocity space . 
 two main classes of explanations for the supershells posit the source of their kinetic energy to be , respectively , internal and external to the parent galaxy . 
 the internal source model involves starbursts , driving stellar winds ( or superwinds ) and subsequent supernova explosions ( e.g. lehnert & heckman 1996 ) . 
 the  chimney model "" ( norman & ikeuchi 1989 ) , for example , attempts to explain disk - halo features and other halo gas via processes related to underlying star formation . 
 the association between extraplanar h@xmath1 filaments and star forming regions in the disk of ngc  891 and other correlations between halo emission and in - disk tracers of star formation ( dahlem et al . 
 1995 ; rand 1997 ) argue in favour of such models . if the presence of hi supershells is found to correlate with the existence of other halo gas , as might be expected in the chimney model , then stellar winds and supernovae are expected to be responsible for the hi supershells as well . 
 the main difficulty with the starburst model for hi supershells lies in the required input energies for the largest shells . using standard assumptions that the expanding supershells are in the post - sedov phase following an ` instantaneous ' injection of energy ( cf . 
 chevalier 1974 ) , hi supershells often require energy input from staggering numbers of spatially correlated supernova events . 
 this was realized early on for our own galaxy ( heiles 1979 , 1984 ) . for external edge - on galaxies , 
 since we are selectively observing only the largest shells , the energy deficit problem is exacerbated . in some cases , 
 hundreds of thousands of clustered supernovae are required ( e.g. ki97 , li97 ) , a conclusion which is not changed significantly if the energy is injected continuously over the lifetime of the shells . other evidence against star formation processes creating the hi shells is also emerging . 
 rhode et al . ( 1999 ) find no optical evidence for recent star formation in the numerous lower energy hi holes of holmberg ii and note that x - ray and fuv emission are also absent . 
 they conclude that supernovae have not played a part in the formation of the hi shells . 
 efremov et al . 
 ( 1998 ) outline numerous other examples in which there appears to be no relation between hi shells and star formation . 
 they , as well as loeb & perna ( 1998 ) , propose that the hi shells are produced , instead , by gamma ray bursts . 
 the alternative external source hypothesis invokes infall of massive gas clouds on to the galactic plane , as a result of gravitational interaction with neighbouring galaxies ( see tenorio - tagle & bodenheimer 1988 ) . 
 this resolves the energy problem since input energy is then a function of the mass and velocity of the infalling cloud . 
 evidence in favour of this hypothesis comes from observations of high velocity clouds ( hvcs ) around our own milky way and the signatures of interaction in m  101 ( van der hulst & sancisi 1988 ) and ngc  4631 ( rand & stone 1996 ) . 
 it does , however , require that the galaxy be in some way interacting with a companion or , at least , that sufficiently massive clouds be in the vicinity . 
 recent observations are revealing galaxies which are apparently isolated , yet harbour extremely large hi supershells . 
 two striking examples are the nearby , sb(s)cd galaxy , ngc  3556 ( ki97 ) and the sbc galaxy , ngc  3044 ( li97 ) . 
 both of these galaxies exhibit radio continuum halos extending to @xmath2 kpc from the galactic plane and have a number of supershells requiring energies up to a few @xmath3 10@xmath4 ergs . 
 these supershells are too large and energetic to have been produced by conventional clustered supernovae . at the same time 
 , there appears to be no evidence for interaction or nearby companions , either . 
 we propose here a new explanation for hi supershells . 
 that is , that they have been formed by radio jets which plow through the interstellar medium ( ism ) , accreting ism gas and sometimes inflating bubbles . 
 this allows for an internal energy source for the hi shells , provides a natural explanation for any spatial symmetries seen in the hi features , and also resolves the energy problem . in sect .  2 
 , we provide arguments in favour of jet inflated hi bubbles , sect .  3 presents the model , and sect . 
 4 discusses the implications of this scenario . 
 seyferts are one class of disk galaxy for which several examples of the nucleus ejecting a radio jet pair have been found ( e.g. ulvestad & wilson 1984a , 1984b , kukula et al . 
 1995 , aoki et al . 
 likewise , several cases of jets occurring in normal spiral galaxies have been reported ( e.g. hummel et al . 1983 ) . 
 prominent examples include ngc  3079 ( de bruyn 1977 ) , ngc  5548 ( ulvestad et al . 
 1999 ) and circinus ( elmouttie et al . 1998 ) . 
 the total energy output from such nuclear activity can approach @xmath5 erg , assuming that the nuclear activity lasts @xmath0 years , and arises from accretion onto a supermassive black hole of @xmath6 at 10% of the eddington limit with the canonical 10% efficiency . in 
 normal "" spiral galaxies , the central mass may be lower ; for example , the bipolar outflow from the sab(rs)cd galaxy , m  101 may be produced by a central @xmath7 10@xmath8 m@xmath9 black hole ( moody et al . 
 while jets are not always observed directly , the growing number of supermassive black holes inferred to be present in the nuclei of normal disk galaxies ( kormendy & richstone 1995 , van der marel 1999 ) , including late - type disks ( ho et al . 
 1997 ) , the milky way itself ( e.g. genzel et al . 
 1997 ) and gas - rich , large low - surface - brightness galaxies ( schombert 1998 ) , lend weight to the idea that many such galaxies may have undergone phases of nuclear activity accompanied with a bi - directional ejection of relativistic plasma jets , before entering a dormant nuclear phase . 
 recent studies have also revealed that the ejection of jets can take place at small angles to the large - scale galactic disk ( e.g. nagar & wilson 1999 ; kinney et al 2000 ) , plausibly leading to clear signatures of their dynamical interaction with the ism . 
 a classic case of such an interaction is the bow - shaped morphology of the radio lobe in the well known seyfert galaxy , ngc  1068 , which strongly suggests that the kiloparsec - scale radio jets are ploughing through the disk medium ( wilson & ulvestad 1987 , axon et al . 
 a dynamical interaction of the jets with the disk is also evident in the case of the spiral galaxy m  51 which is at the low end of nuclear activity scale . here 
 , the jets seem to have created a pair of ` radio lobes ' on opposite sides of the nucleus ; whereas one of the lobes is bow - shaped , the other one is actually resolved into a ring which is also detected in h@xmath1 emission ( ford et al . 
 another example is ngc  4258 whose vlbi jet has been ejected close to the galaxy disk ( see cecil et al . 
 1995 , herrnstein et al . 
 1997 , cecil et al . 
 large scale ( 14 kpc length )  anomalous arms "" are also seen _ within _ the galactic disk and have been interpreted as manifestations of a larger - scale jet ( e.g. martin et al . 
 1989 , but see cox & downes 1996 ) . in m  101 , 
 the bipolar outflow is also roughly confined to the disk , with the outflow not expected to extend beyond a height of 400 pc ( moody et al . 
 additional support for the jet - disk interaction hypothesis in these disk galaxies comes from the detection of shock - excited optical emission lines associated with the radio lobes , as discussed in some of the references cited above . 
 it is further interesting to note that radio bubbles and shells of synchrotron plasma have been discovered within the lobes of a few radio galaxies . 
 two spectacular examples are 3c310 ( van breugel & fomalont , 1984 ) and hercules a ( dreher & feigelson 1984 ) . in hercules a , in addition , peculiar dark shells , about 3 kpc in size , have been found straddling the nucleus along the radio outflow axes ( baum et al . 
 for the dark shells , baum et al . prefer an explanation in terms of expanding bubbles of hot gas ejected from the active nucleus along the radio axis , in agreement with plasmon - like ejection from the core , though they do not rule out other possibilities . 
 these cases provide a clue that the radio bubbles / shells may have been ` puffed ' up due to localized instabilities in the radio jets , occurring at distances of a few kiloparsecs from the active nucleus ( e.g. morrison & sadun 1996 ) . 
 should such instabilities arise also in the jets ejected within disk galaxies ( sect . 
 2.1 ) , it is quite plausible that the resulting increase in pressure at those locations would inflate bubbles and shells out of the ambient ism material which is hi rich , in the case of spirals . 
 such features , puffed out of the disk during the brief phase of jet instability , would remain visible past the radiative lifetime of the synchrotron plasma against the radiative and expansion losses , which is typically of order @xmath10 years .        in ngc  3556 , 
 the two most prominent supershells are located symmetrically near the opposite extremities of the galaxy . 
 ki97 have carried out a detailed mapping of the hi and radio continuum emission from this nearly edge - on galaxy located 11.6 mpc away . 
 the superimposition of 2 channels of hi emission , symmetrically placed in velocity about systemic , are shown in fig . 
 1 a. the most obvious features are two loops of hi , producing extensions to the east and west along the major axis . fig . 
 1b shows the hi emission from these velocities superimposed on the radio continuum map , the latter taken from entirely independent observations . 
 the abrupt density drop - off in the radio continuum map occurs roughly where the optical galaxy ends ( fig . 
 1a inset ) . 
 the salient features of this system most relevant to the present study ( see fig . 1 ; ki97 ) are :    \(a ) two symmetrically placed giant hi loops are seen originating at a projected galactocentric radius of about 12 kpc on the east and west major axis . they appear to originate right at the opposite edges of the optical disk and extend , not perpendicular to the disk plane , but rather parallel to it and outwards . 
 \(b ) the giant hi loops or supershells are slightly bent into a z - symmetry . 
 \(c ) these hi loops are most obvious in velocity channels which are equally spaced about the systemic velocity of the galaxy ( though they extend over a larger velocity range , see ki97 ) . 
 \(d ) from their velocity dependent morphology , each of the loops shows evidence for shell expansion , but with only half of the shell present . in both cases , the receding side ( with respect to galaxy rotation ) is open . 
 \(e ) other smaller hi loops and extensions do exist at smaller galactocentric radii . 
 \(f ) the parameters of these two hi supershells are as follows : the eastern supershell has a mass , m = 5.9 @xmath3 10@xmath11 m@xmath9 , a radius , r = 3.2 kpc , an expansion velocity , @xmath12 = 51.7 km s@xmath13 , a kinematic age , @xmath14 = 6.0 @xmath3 10@xmath11 yr , a kinetic energy , e@xmath15 = 1.6 @xmath3 10@xmath16 ergs , and an implied input energy ( assuming instantaneous input from supernovae ) of e = 2.6 @xmath3 10@xmath4 ergs 
 . the parameters of the western supershell are : m = 2.3 @xmath3 10@xmath11 m@xmath9 , r = 1.85 kpc , @xmath12 = 41.4 km s@xmath13 , @xmath14 = 4.4 @xmath3 10@xmath11 yr , e@xmath15 = 3.9 @xmath3 10@xmath17 ergs , and e = 3.4 @xmath3 10@xmath18 ergs . 
 \(g ) the energy needed to create the eastern supershell alone would require a star cluster populated by @xmath19 ob stars , if supernovae and stellar winds are the drivers . 
 \(h ) the brighter and more spectacular eastern supershell has associated hi gas which extends as far as 30 kpc beyond the eastern edge of the optical disk and possibly much farther ( see fig . 
 1a inset ) . 
 the huge eastern hi extension appears to open up from one side of the eastern shell and extends fairly straight outwards in the radial , rather than the vertical direction as if formed in a short period of time in comparison to galactic rotation . 
 \(i ) the galaxy contains a large nonthermal radio halo with a scale height of @xmath2 kpc above the plane ( see also de bruyn & hummel 1979 , bloemen et al . 
 1993 ) . 
 \(j ) radio continuum emission appears to be associated with the hi loops , but is not spatially coincident with them . 
 the radio continuum emission extends farther out than the hi supershells , as if  funnelling "" along or through the hi features ( ki97 ; fig . 
 \(k ) ngc  3556 has no obvious interacting companions . 
 the brightest galaxy in the vicinity is the 16th magnitude , mcg+09 - 19 - 001 , 25@xmath20 in size , undisturbed in appearance and @xmath7 12@xmath21 to the east of ngc  3556 . 
 this is most likely a background source . 
 ngc  5775 , an interacting galaxy , shows symmetrically placed hi features ( lee et al . 
 2000 ) in the sense that hi extensions occur on opposite sides of the major axis in which there appears to be an underlying disturbance ; these features occur at similar galactocentric radii , in projection ( see also fig . 3 of irwin 1994 which shows 3 of the extensions ) . 
 ngc  2613 ( chaves & irwin 2000 ) also shows six hi extensions which occur in pairs symmetrically on either side of the major axis ; two of the pairs occur near the ends of the optical disk . 
 another potentially very interesting example is m  31 . 
 blitz et al . ( 1999 ) show that two massive hi clouds exist symmetrically placed on opposite sides of this galaxy . 
 they bear a remarkable resemblance to extragalactic radio jets . 
 the two clouds are redshifted by @xmath22 km s@xmath13 with respect to the systemic velocity of m  31 . 
 conceivably , this could be explained by ram pressure sweeping as m  31 falls through the igm towards the milky way . 
 as mentioned above , the galaxy ngc  3556 puts to a severe test both of the standard explanations for the supershell phenomenon , namely : ( i ) localized starburst ( generating intense stellar winds , followed by multiple supernova explosions ) , and ( ii ) infall of massive gas clouds on to the galactic disk . 
 the major difficulties faced by these models , as highlighted in ki97 , are :    \(a ) * localized starbursts : * the energy needed to create the eastern supershell alone would require a star cluster populated by @xmath23 ob stars . 
 even for the recently discovered ` super star clusters ( ssc ) ' in some starburst galaxies , not more than @xmath24 ob stars are implied ( meurer et al . 1995 ) . 
 there is no indication of an ob association even remotely approaching the level of sscs at the locations of the supershells in ngc  3556 . 
 since the kinematic ages of the supershells are @xmath7 5 @xmath3 10@xmath11 yr , the starburst would have to have occurred within this time frame . yet 
 starburst durations and ob association ages are typically also of this order , so some evidence of the starburst might be expected to have survived . 
 no such evidence is presently found , however . 
 ngc  3556 does not show a markedly high supernova rate globally ( irwin et al . 1999 ) and independent low and high resolution radio continuum observations show no evidence for a source of energy at the bases of the supershells ( ki97 , irwin et al . 
 2000 ) . 
 \(b ) * infalling clouds : * several arguments have been advanced against this possibility ( ki97 ) . 
 firstly , this galaxy appears isolated , making the source of the putative clouds puzzlesome . secondly , to impart sufficient kinetic energy for the creation of the eastern supershell , an infalling cloud of mass @xmath25 would be required . a cloud this massive 
 would easily have been detected on the sensitive hi maps , yet no such cloud or clouds are seen . 
 ( an exception would be if the clouds had very narrow line widths , low fractal dimensions and were optically thick , in which case they could have been missed due to low filling factors . ) 
 thirdly , if an encounter with intergalactic clouds has occurred in the past , it would be necessary to postulate that two very massive clouds just happened to fall in parallel to the major axis at opposite ends of the galaxy , roughly at the same time , a scenario which seems implausible . 
 fourthly , we could instead suggest that a  rain "" of hi clouds is infalling ( since other high latitude hi structures are also seen in this galaxy ) , including two which fell in along the major axis at either end . 
 however , in order for the rain to be no longer visible , the infall would have to be completed over a timescale which is less than or equal to the age of the supershells , i.e. a few 10@xmath11 years . 
 this is unlikely since infall timescales are of order a dynamical timescale which is typically a few 10@xmath26 yr .    while these arguments have been applied to ngc  3556 alone , the difficulty with internal energy from starbursting applies to a number of galaxies , as outlined in sect .  1 . 
 infalling clouds are certainly plausible , but run into difficulties for isolated galaxies such as ngc  3556 and ngc  3044 . barring new information coming to light on these galaxies , we therefore argue that a new model should be considered .      as mentioned earlier , the duality of the expanding hi supershells in ngc  3556 , together with their locations at the opposite edges of the disk marked by steep density gradients , their z - symmetric deviations from spherical symmetry , as well as their anomalously large energy requirements ( sect . 
 2.3.1 ) , together lead us to argue that the origin of these two supershells is linked to the jet phenomenon . in sect . 
 2 we have noted several manifestations of jet instabilities giving rise to bubble - shaped features , or shells , in the form of optical nebulosities or nonthermal radio emission in normal spirals and radio galaxies . in the present context of hi supershells , we examine the possibility of the supershell being inflated due to localised instabilities in the radio jets as they plough through the ism of the disk of ngc  3556 . 
 the present discussion should only be viewed as a feasibility check based on energy considerations , and not as a detailed quantitative model for the supershells . even in the case of ngc  3556 , 
 the standard mechanisms for the supershells ( sect . 
 1 ) may well have contributed at some level .    according to our proposal , 
 the two radio jets ejected close to the plane of the disk , during the active phase of the nucleus , undergo a rapid _ flaring _ as they encounter the region of large scale density decline near the outskirts of the galactic disk . consequently , both synchrotron plasma and the entrained thermal plasma deposited by the jets in these two regions get heated and the resulting high - pressure bubble of hot plasma undergoes a rapid expansion , sweeping the gas - rich ambient medium into the shape of the hi supershells . 
 an idealization to such a situation is the flaring of a jet crossing an ism / igm interface , which was first discussed in the context of radio galaxies analytically by gopal - krishna & wiita ( 1987 ) , followed by two - dimensional ( norman et al . 
 1988 , wiita et al . 
 1990 , zhang et al . 
 1999 ) and three - dimensional ( loken et al . 
 1995 , hooda & wiita 1996 , 1998 ) numerical simulations . the simulations by loken et al . 
 showed that intermediate power radio jets associated with wide - angle - tail ( wat ) sources undergo a rapid flaring upon crossing the ism / igm density discontinuity where a moderately supersonic jet becomes subsonic . 
 as shown by the numerical simulations , a density drop of a factor of just a few can cause such a flaring ( e.g. hooda & wiita 1996 ) . 
 observational evidence for the jet flaring comes from wide - angle - tail ( wat ) radio sources which are associated with the dominant members of rich clusters of galaxies ( e.g. odonoghue et al . 
 further evidence is provided , e.g. , by the recent radio / optical / x - ray study of the wat radio galaxy 3c465 in the abell cluster a2634 ( sakelliou & merrifield 1999 ) . particularly instructive for the present study 
 is the case of the active disk galaxy iras 04210 + 0400 ; the two @xmath27 kpc long radio jets associated with this disk galaxy are seen to flare up near the opposite optical boundaries of the galaxy ( holloway et al 1996 ) . 
 it may be noted that during their passage through the inner parts of the galactic disk , the jets are likely to encounter large ism density fluctuations . 
 however , these are less prone to disrupt the jets because of the higher jet thrust there , combined with the expected small spatial scale of the density fluctuations compared with the jets cross - section . 
 since the postulated radio jets in ngc  3556 are currently too weak for detection , a point which we re - address below , we shall adopt here the jet parameters inferred for another massive disk galaxy , ngc  4258 ( sect . 
 2.1 ) , and apply them to known conditions in ngc  3556 . 
 the jet velocity , as measured from the emission line gas , is _ at least _ 
 v@xmath28 = 2000 km s@xmath13 which , together with a density of @xmath29 = 0.02 @xmath30 g @xmath31 , where @xmath30 is the mass of the proton , correspond to a kinetic luminosity of l@xmath28 @xmath7 10@xmath32 erg s@xmath13 ( falcke & biermann 1999 ) . 
 assuming that the ram pressure in the jet dominates over the internal thermal pressure , then across the shock front we require @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the ambient gas density , and @xmath35 is the shock velocity . taking @xmath34 = 0.26 @xmath30 g @xmath31 at the positions of the supershells ( ki97 ) , we obtain @xmath35 = 435 km s@xmath13 . 
 this is slightly higher than the value of @xmath7 300 km s@xmath13 estimated for ngc  4258 . 
 the shock velocity puts a minimum timescale on the duration of the jet in this model , since there must be sufficient time for the jet to propagate out to the locations of the supershells at 12 kpc galactocentric radius . 
 thus , the minimum duration of the jets is 2.7 @xmath3 10@xmath11 yr for the parameters in this illustration . 
 the mechanical power of the jet would then be @xmath36 = @xmath37 = 5 @xmath3 10@xmath38 erg s@xmath13 , where the effective jet radius , r has a typical value of 1 kpc ( e.g. cecil et al 1995 ) . 
 this is similar to the jet power estimated for the well known spiral galaxy m  51 , which is at the low end of the scale of nuclear activity ( cf . 
 ford et al 1985 ) . in ngc  3556 
 , the integrated mechanical luminosity of the jet over its minimum lifetime is then @xmath7 4 @xmath3 10@xmath4 erg . 
 this lower limit is adequate to account for the observed kinetic energy associated with the larger eastern supershell ( sect . 
 here we have assumed that the efficiency for converting the input energy into the kinetic energy of the shell is of order 1% as usually taken for the multiple supernova model . for a higher efficiency , the required jet power can be lower . 
 the expansion of a typical bubble in the ism should then proceed similarly to previously modelled scenarios , the difference being the source of input energy . 
 since the input energy is much higher than conventional supernovae , the bubbles are more likely to achieve blowout , providing a natural conduit through which cosmic rays ( including those supplied by the jets ) can escape into the halo . 
 thus , the presence of supershells is expected to correlate with the existence of a nonthermal radio halo . 
 the locations of the anchor points of the two supershells in ngc  3556 suggest that the postulated blasting of each supershell would have occurred at a galactocentric distance which is just past the peak of the hi rotation curve ( see fig . 
 6 of ki97 ) . 
 the radially outward expansion of each supershell would then expose it to the velocity shear in the medium , exerting a side - ways wind pressure counter to the galactic rotation . 
 due to this , the half of the supershell towards the direction of the galactic rotation would be compressed and hence brightened , whilst the other half would be dragged out due to the velocity shear in the external medium and , consequently , dimmed . 
 such a deformation of the two supershells from spherical symmetry , in course of their expansion , would give rise to a z - symmetry , which is consistent with the observations ( sect .  2.3.1 ; ki97 ) . 
 the cooling time for the x - ray emitting sheaths around the jets of ngc  4258 , assuming unity filling factor , is only 4 @xmath3 10@xmath8 yr ( cecil et al . 1995 ) and therefore , once the jets have turned off , such a signature of their existence would disappear rapidly . 
 the lifetime of the synchrotron emitting particles in the jets is longer , typically from 10@xmath8 to 10@xmath11 yr . for ngc  4258 
 , it has been estimated to be between 1 to 5 @xmath3 10@xmath11 yr ( martin et al . 1989 ) . 
 however , shorter timescales are possible and will depend on local magnetic field strength and spectral index . 
 for instance , the magnetic field in the north - east radio jet in ngc  1068 , which extends to @xmath7 450 pc from the nucleus , is @xmath7 5 @xmath3 10@xmath39 gauss and the spectral index is -1 ( wilson & ulvestad 1987 ) . 
 this gives a synchrotron lifetime of only 1.5 @xmath3 10@xmath40 yr . 
 the particle lifetime is expected to be shorter in shocks where the magnetic field is compressed . 
 thus , we expect the radio jet in ngc  3556 to fade over a timescale less than the ages of the supershells . 
 similar arguments apply to the radio core which is expected to decay faster than the jets , once the nuclear activity has switched off , given the likelihood of a stronger magnetic field and flatter spectral index in the core . 
 even if some radio emission from a core were to persist after the activity ceases , it may be below the rms noise level of the available maps . 
 chary & becklin ( 1997 ) , for example , estimate the radio luminosity of the core of ngc  4258 , which is known to have a supermassive central object of mass 3.6 @xmath3 10@xmath11 m@xmath9 and a vlbi jet , to be l@xmath41 = 100 l@xmath9 . 
 the 2@xmath42 noise level of the radio maps of irwin et al . 
 ( 2000 ) corresponds to a radio power of 6.8 @xmath3 10@xmath43 w hz@xmath13 . 
 integrating over 10@xmath44 hz , this yields a radio luminosity of 180 l@xmath9 . 
 thus , even if ngc  3556 harbours a radio core of the same luminosity as ngc  4258 , it would not have been detected in the observations mentioned above . 
 in this study we have sketched a scenario whereby radio jets ejected during an active nuclear phase in the life of a large spiral galaxy could inflate out of the disk exceptionally large shells , i.e. supershells of neutral hydrogen gas . when applied to the scd galaxy , ngc  3556 
 , this model can account for each of the several features enumerated in sect . 
 2.3.1 . in the context of the hi supershells seen in this galaxy , this scheme appears to fare distinctly better than either of the two standard models for supershells which invoke either a starburst induced superwind or an infall of external gas clouds on to the galaxy disk . 
 thus , the jet - ism interaction scenario for disk galaxies could effectively supplement the other two mechanisms already proposed for the supershell phenomenon , with a greater relevance whenever the shells are extraordinarily large as well as energetic and occur at large galactocentric distances . 
 the energy requirement is no longer a major issue in the present model . 
 even a modest energy input from a 10@xmath11 m@xmath9 compact object at the galactic nucleus , such as that observed in ngc  4258 , is more than adequate to supply the input energy required for the supershells of ngc  3556 . 
 this model can therefore account for hi supershells which are difficult to form via conventional processes involving massive star formation , or those occurring in galaxies lacking potentially interacting companions . 
 larger supershells ( or parts thereof , given the probable development of instabilities ) may also be predicted , since known central masses and/or accretion rates may well surpass those considered here . 
 furthermore , the present model can account for the symmetric hi features in galaxies . 
 for instance , it is more likely that bubbles will be inflated by the propagating jets at galactocentric radii where the ism density has declined to sufficiently low values for blow - out . at the same time 
 , symmetry is not a generic outcome our model , since local shocks , dictated by the interaction of the jet with local density perturbations , can be important in determining where the bubbles will be inflated . 
 for example , known bubbles in the lobes of radio galaxies ( sect . 
 2.2 ) are not always seen to be equidistant on either side of the nucleus .    in our sample illustration ( sect . 
 3.2 ) , the jets must exist for long enough to reach large galactocentric radii ( 3 @xmath3 10@xmath11 yr ) but need to inject energy over only a fraction of the lifetime of the supershells ( 2 @xmath3 10@xmath11 yr , or even less , if the efficiency exceeds 1% ) . 
 the jets presumably switch off thereafter , with the synchrotron emitting particles decaying in 10@xmath8 - 10@xmath11 yr . 
 it is difficult to predict whether jets and hi supershells should co - exist in spirals . 
 nuclear activity in galaxies is commonly believed to be a transient phenomenon , lasting for @xmath45 years ( e.g. eilek 1996 , scheuer 1995 ; soltan 1982 ; haehnelt & rees 1993 ; ho et al 1997 ) . 
 if agn activity occurs on timescales longer than a few @xmath3 10@xmath11 yr , this would suggest that there might be disk galaxies in which both phenomena should be observed at the same time . 
 however , such nuclear activity timescales are likely to be more representative of radio galaxies ; agn activity in spirals is probably shorter lived . 
 an important next step is to consider what jet parameters are required to reach large , or at least kpc - scale radii , in traversing the typical ism of a spiral galaxy .    if jets in spirals both recur and precess , it may be possible to inflate bubbles over a variety of galactocentric radii and azimuthal angles 
 . however , it is unlikely that the  frothy "" nature of the hi seen in galaxies such as holmberg ii or the holes in m  31 could be produced by such jets directly without seeing some lingering evidence for the jets as well . 
 also , the jet phenomenon can not directly account for features which correlate with the star forming disk , such as some known radio and h@xmath1 halos . 
 if there is a connection , it is more likely to be indirect . 
 for example , once the expansion of the postulated jet - blown supershells is halted due to the gravitational pull of the host galaxy , their segments ( i.e. hi clumps ) would eventually shower back on to the galactic disk , giving rise to secondary shells , bubbles and cavities in the hi component of the disk . 
 the impact could also trigger sporadic bursts of star formation , especially in the outer disk , as seen , e.g. , in gas - rich low - surface - brightness galaxies ( cf . 
 oneil et al . 
 1997 ) which are thought to be the present - day remnants of quasars ( e.g. schombert 1998 ) . 
 thus , much after its cessation , the nuclear activity in gas - rich galaxies may continue to influence the evolution of their disks .

 1999 , pasj 51 , 449","taking a clue from the pair of hi supershells found in the scd galaxy ngc  3556 ( m  108 ) , we propose a new mechanism for the origin of hi supershells in gas - rich massive galaxies . in this scenario , 
 the two supershells were inflated out of the neutral hydrogen disk due to the localised flaring of a pair of radio lobes formed by the jets ejected from the nucleus during an active phase about @xmath0 years ago , but have faded away by now . 
 it is shown that the salient features of this supershell pair , such as their symmetrical locations about the galactic centre , the anomalously large energy requirements , the large galacto - centric distances , as well as the z - symmetric hemispherical shapes , find a more natural explanation in terms of this scenario , as compared to the standard models which postulate either a massive starburst , or the infall of external gas clouds . 
 other possible implications of this hypothesis are briefly discussed .",arxiv
"main laws of quantum mechanics forbids the perfect cloning of the quantum states , see corresponding discussion for the pure states in @xcite , @xcite , and for the mixed states in @xcite . 
 but it is possible to carry out an approximate copying of the quantum states @xcite . 
 quantum cloning machines ( qcm ) depend on the conditions accepted at its designing . 
 they can produce identical copies of the initial state ( symmetric qcm ) , nonidentical copies ( non - symmetric qcm ) , the quality of the copying can be either identical for all states ( universal qcm ) or depend on the state ( state - dependente qcm ) . 
 detailed discussion of the different variants of qcm and theirs possible applications in quantum cryptography and quantum informatics can be found in @xcite , @xcite . 
 one possible application of the qcm is an eavesdropping of the quantum channel . 
 the aim of such eavesdropping defines the main properties of the designing qcm . 
 one can design qcm which copies only part of the quantum state , for instance . 
 such qcm can be useful if eavesdropper , usually called eve , intends to catch part of the transmitted quantum information only . 
 some classical analogue of this situation can be classical eavesdropping of the key words in the transmitted classical information . at quantum cloning 
 we can choose the different parts of the quantum signal in which we are interested . 
 in this paper we intend to discuss some `` partial '' qcm , which copies one constituent of the two - partite states . 
 our approach gives the possibility to consider qcm for a mixed states too . 
 it is well known fact , that any mixed state can be considered as a reduction of a pure state , which is called `` purification '' of the mixed state @xcite . 
 so , cloning of the mixed state can be considered as a `` partial '' cloning of the `` purification '' of the mixed state . 
 some difference between the `` partial '' cloning machine and the cloning machine for the mixed states is connected with the corresponding difference of the sets of the initial states , see details below . 
 note , that the main attention in the present literature was devoted to the cloning of the pure states @xcite , @xcite . 
 we consider two - partite qubit states , qubits are elements of two - dimensional hilbert space @xmath0 . in order to construct qcm we need in tensor product of three such spaces on the ancilla space : @xmath1 , here different components are marked by indexes . 
 the first and third qubit components constitute a quantum state which carries information in the quantum channel , and the state of first component is interesting for eve . 
 the second component is a blank state , where we will copy the first component , the last component is necessary for the realization of the qcm . 
 let quantum channel carries the quantum state @xmath2 @xmath3 where normalization condition holds , @xmath4 here and below @xmath5 are base vectors in @xmath6 . 
 we suppose , that eve s goal is a copying of the first component of this state . after tracing one can obtain : @xmath7 @xmath8 so , eve has to realize the cloning to produce the pair of states ( in the first and second components respectively ) closest to @xmath9 we consider here symmetric qcm , so , we suppose , that states in the first and second components have to coincide . then produced state must be symmetric with regard to permutation of the first and second components . 
 let us introduce the orthonormal basis in the subspace of @xmath10 symmetric regarding this permutation : @xmath11 let s assume , that the second component be in state @xmath12 initially . 
 description of the qcm is , in essence , the definition of the corresponding unitary operator @xmath13 . 
 following to @xcite , @xcite , we set @xmath14 @xmath15 where @xmath16 are some vectors , belonging to @xmath17 . 
 symmetry of qcm is provided by the fact , that right - hand part of this relation contains linear combinations of vectors @xmath18 only . 
 taking into account ( [ init ] ) , we obtain : @xmath19 @xmath20 @xmath21 generally speaking , the choice of the unitary operator @xmath13 is very broad and corresponding analysis is quite complex even for the lowest dimensions , so usually one admits some additional restrictions . 
 we suppose as in @xcite , that following conditions ( which guarantee the unitarity of @xmath13 ) are fulfilled : @xmath22 @xmath23 let @xmath24 so as @xmath25 , @xmath26 . in this case qcm 
 produces the next state from @xmath27 : @xmath28 @xmath29 @xmath30 reducing this state on the first component , we obtain : @xmath31 @xmath32 it is necessary to compare the initial state and state which is produced by the qcm , in other words , we have to choose the measure of the closeness of these states . 
 there are different measures , specifically , fidelity . 
 it is defined for the mixed states as @xmath33 ^2 $ ] , this value is not very suitable for the analytical considerations . 
 we use here more convenient measure : @xmath34 ^2 = w(\zeta , \nu , \psi ) , \ ] ] where @xmath35 + \ ] ] @xmath36 @xmath37 .\ ] ] this value estimates the difference between initial and final states with fixed parameters @xmath38 . for the determination of the qcm parameters we average this value respect to the set of all initial states . 
 we use here the next parametrization of the initial state @xmath39 : @xmath40 @xmath41 where @xmath42 here the first component has zero phase due to the corresponding freedom of the choice . for the averaging we need in corresponding measure . 
 supposing that all states @xmath43 are equiprobable , we choose as such a measure @xmath44 @xmath45 simple calculations lead to the conclusion , that @xmath46 takes its minimal value at @xmath47 , @xmath48 . 
 this value @xmath49 implies , that vectors @xmath50 and @xmath51 are parallel . 
 the values of the fidelity @xmath33 ^2 $ ] , calculated at @xmath52 , for the states on the `` real '' part of the bloch sphere , @xmath53 @xmath54 , @xmath55 , are plotted in fig.1 . 
 evidently , that this qcm is state - dependent one , because the quality of the cloning depends on the quantum state . 
 the construction described above can be used for the cloning of the mixed states . 
 note , that final state produced by qcm depend on the reduction of the initial state @xmath56 ( [ red ] ) only . 
 it means , that one can reverse our considerations and take the mixed state @xmath56 as initial one . 
 then pure state @xmath43 defined by relation ( [ init ] ) belongs to the space of the larger dimension and it is a `` purification '' of the state @xmath56 . 
 `` purification '' of the given mixed state @xmath56 can be realized by different methods , as it follows from ( [ init ] ) , but this nonuniqueness has not influence in the results . 
 qcm constructed in accordance with relations ( [ ccm1 ] ) , ( [ ccm2 ] ) produces states ( [ out12 ] ) , ( [ out ] ) , which depend on the parameters of the initial state @xmath56 only . 
 but the set of the initial states is changing , one has to use another parametrization for this set . 
 as such parametrization one can take a bloch sphere , see @xcite . 
 namely , density matrix @xmath56 can be described as @xmath57 where @xmath58 in the spherical coordinates we have : @xmath59 @xmath60 and @xmath61 in order to obtain the parameters of the qcm one has to average the value @xmath62 on the bloch sphere . 
 we suppose that all states in the bloch sphere are equiprobable , so averaging is reduced to the integral @xmath63 note , that if eve has a priori information about transmitted quantum information she has to choose corresponding weight multiplier . 
 we are searching in such values @xmath64 which correspond to the minimal value @xmath65 . as a result 
 we obtain @xmath66 . 
 the plot of fidelity for these parameters differs in a small way from the preceding one , so we omit it . 
 we have discussed here a `` partial '' quantum cloning , when only one component of the two - partite pure state is cloning . such cloning can be considered as a variant of the eavesdropping of the quantum channel . 
 the choice of the parameters of the qcm was realized with help of the some natural criterion . 
 namely , we seek in parameters corresponding to the minimum of the integral average of the `` distance '' between the initial state and output state . 
 note , that fidelity of the initial and output states for the most part of the bloch sphere exceeds value 5/6 which corresponds to the universal qcm for the pure states @xcite . 
 this fact has two reasons . 
 firstly , described qcm copies only part of the two - partite state . 
 second , this qcm is state - dependent one , and this non - universality raises the quality of the cloning . 
 moreover , here was discussed the cloning of the mixed qubit states . in order to consider such device we use the `` purification '' of the mixed state and then apply `` partial '' cloning machine . 
 let s emphasize , that `` purification '' of the mixed state is not unique , but the output state produced by our qcm does not depend on this nonuniqueness . 
 parameters of the qcm was sought by minimization of the integral average of the distance between the initial and output states . 
 note , that this averaging differs from the used above because the sets of the states are different . in this case 
 the fidelity of the initial and output states on the real part of the bloch sphere exceeds the value 5/6 too . 
 evidently , that choice of the parameters @xmath67 for the qcm is defined by the strategy of the eavesdropping . 
 w have discussed here only one possible qcm for the mixed states . evidently , that there are many other variants for the qcm , may be , without restrictions like ( [ ccm1 ] ) , ( [ ccm2 ] ) , ( [ con1 ] ) , asymmetric qcm etc .

"colloidal suspensions present the possibility to develop novel materials via self - assembly . of particular interest are colloidal crystals , whose optical properties can generate iridescent colours , and provide a means by which photonic crystals may be produced@xcite , while further applications range from lasers @xcite to display devices @xcite , with recent advances demonstrating tunable colours through control of lattice spacing with an external field @xcite . 
 further to the practical importance of colloidal crystals , their well - defined thermodynamic temperature allows colloidal dispersions to be viewed as mesoscopic ` model atoms ' @xcite . 
 recently , the ability to tune the colloid - colloid interactions has led to the observation of a wide variety of structures @xcite . 
 of particular interest here , to first order ac electric fields can induce dipolar interactions between the colloidal particles , leading to anisotropic interparticle potentials and exotic crystal structures , some of which are not observed in atomic and molecular systems @xcite , while external control of the colloid - colloid interactions allows direct observation of phase transitions @xcite . 
 furthermore , direct microscopic observation at the single - particle level allows an unprecedented level of detail to be accessed @xcite , opening the possibility of tackling long - standing problems in condensed matter , such as freezing @xcite . 
 the introduction of a rotating ac field opens up even more possibilities . in this case , the dipolar interactions lead to an attraction in the plane of rotation and to repulsions above and below . 
 studies with a rotating magnetic field on granular matter indeed produced disc like patterns consistent with expectations @xcite . unlike granular matter , since colloidal dispersions exhibit brownian motion , thermodynamic equilibrium structures ( ie crystals ) , may be obtained @xcite . in previous work snoswell 
 _ @xcite showed that lattice spacing within quasi-2d colloidal crystals could be controlled _ in - situ _ 
 , by means of coplanar rotating electric field . 
 the interparticle dipolar interactions in the plane of the electric field may be treated to first order as a circularly symmetric attraction , due to the time averaging effect of a rapidly rotating field ( 1000hz ) on relatively large particles on the micron lengthscale , where the diffusive timescale is of the order of seconds @xcite .    in considering the interactions between the particles , 
 the asymmetry between the colloids ( 10nm-1@xmath0 m ) and smaller molecular and ionic species must be addressed . 
 a number of coarse - graining schemes have been developed where the smaller components are formally integrated out @xcite . 
 this generates a one - component picture , where only the effective colloid - colloid interactions are considered , and the complexity of the description is vastly reduced . 
 the equilibrium behaviour of the colloids in the original multi - component system may then be faithfully reproduced by appeal to liquid state theory @xcite and computer simulation @xcite . 
 central to the success of this one - component approach is the use of a suitable effective colloid - colloid interaction @xmath1 .    in this study 
 , we use a simple numerical treatement in which we can predict the lattice spacing in the quasi 2d crystal from the electric field strength . 
 we consider a model system of charged colloids , in a rotating electric field @xcite . by exploiting the knowledge both of the electrostatic repulsions and dipolar attractions , we present a direct , quantitative comparison of a tunable interaction and a material property of the crystalline ` rafts ' formed . 
 we combine experimental measurements of the crystal lattice constant @xmath2 as a function of field strength @xmath3 with monte - carlo simulations according to a screened coulomb repulsion plus dipolar attraction where the only fitting parameter is the debye screening length .    in the simulations , we use pairwise interactions , in other words 
 we assume that at the higher densities at which the crystalline rafts are formed , the system is still accurately described by interactions calculated for two particles in isolation . 
 we note that deviations from this assumption of pairwise additivity have been measured both in the case of strongly charged colloids @xcite and in the case of _ repulsive _ dipolar interactions @xcite . 
 we further compare simulation results with the minimum of the effective potential , which we take as a measure of the lattice constant of the crystalline rafts , which we also determine from experimental data . 
 this paper is organised into six sections . in section 
 [ theory ] we present expressions for the effective interactions between the colloids , summing the attractions and repulsions to provide an effective one - component description of the system . 
 section [ experimental ] describes our experimental metholodogy . 
 section [ simulation ] outlines the monte - carlo simulation technique employed . 
 the comparison of simulation and experimental results is presented in section [ results ] and in section [ tunability ] we extrapolate our findings to maximise the tunability of the crystal lattice constant , which may be useful for applications . 
 we conclude our findings in section [ conclusions ] . 
 in the following we will consider a system consisting of two particles in a surrounding medium . 
 we shall assume that these particles are charged , leading to a repulsive interaction , and that the rotating ac electric field induces a dipole moment in the two particles and thus induces an attractive interaction . to describe this system , we start from the derjaguin , landau , verwey and overbeek ( dlvo ) approach @xcite , which consists of attractive van der waals interactions at short range , and long - ranged repulsive electrostatic interactions . 
 the van der waals interactions are very short - ranged , and are neglected , as electrostatic repulsions inhibit the close approach at which van der waals interactions become important . 
 we shall therefore assume that the only relevant attractions result from the long - ranged dipolar interactions induced by the rotating electric field .    in the linear poisson - boltzmann regime 
 , the electrostatic repulsions may be expressed as a hard core yukawa , or screened coulomb interaction @xcite ,    @xmath4    where @xmath5 where @xmath6 is boltzmann s constant , @xmath7 is temperature and @xmath8 is the colloid diameter . 
 the potential at contact , @xmath9 is given by    @xmath10    where @xmath11 is the colloid charge , @xmath12 is the bjerrum length and @xmath13 is the inverse debye screening length where @xmath14 is the total number density of monovalent ions . 
 now the regime of linear poisson - boltzmann theory in which equation ( [ eqyuk ] ) holds corresponds to relatively weak charging . 
 although this is not the case here , a potential of the yukawa form is recovered at larger separations , if a smaller , renormalized charge is considered @xcite . 
 we tabulate measurements of the @xmath15-potential of dilute suspensions in table [ tablekappasigma ] . 
 these values suggest that we expect a renormalised charge , in the conditions under which the colloids form the crystalline rafts , rather high colloid concentration , hence high counter ion concentration @xcite . therefore , noting that the debye length is much smaller than the colloid radius , we follow bocquet _ et . 
 _ @xcite and take the following expression for the renormalised charge @xmath16 :    @xmath17    which we substitute for @xmath11 in equation ( [ eqepsilonyuk ] ) . 
 this expression gives good agreement with measurements of the effective colloid charge for particles with a comparable @xmath15-potential @xcite . 
 we recall that many - body effects can lead to a density - dependence in the effective colloid - colloid interactions @xcite . 
 however , we shall neglect these effects in the present work . 
 the attractive potential between the colloids resulting from the rotating ac electric field is treated to first order as a dipolar interaction : @xmath18    where @xmath19 is the induced dipole moment of each particle , @xmath20 is the dielectric constant and @xmath21 is the permittivity of free space . 
 the dipole moment may be calculated from the strength of the electric field    @xmath22    where @xmath23 is the clausius - mosotti factor and takes values between 1 and -1/2 depending upon the origin of the dipole moment . 
 we note that in this case of an alternating field , the root - mean - square of the time dependent field is taken . 
 substituting @xmath24 leads us to a potential at contact    @xmath25    which has a cubic dependence on the colloid diameter , in the case of all other contributions being unchanged .    in considering the value of the clausius - mosotti factor , 
 two regimes are relevant , corresponding to applied electric fields of high and low frequency , in which the dipolar interactions result from dielectric permittivity differences between the particles and the solvent and differences in conductivity respectively @xcite . 
 the crossover frequency @xmath26 between these regimes is given by    @xmath27    where @xmath28 are conductivities and the indices @xmath19 and @xmath29 refer to the colloidal particles and the medium respectively . 
 following @xcite the conductivity of the particles @xmath30 is taken to be the sum of the bulk conductivity @xmath31 and the conductivity on the surface @xmath32 . 
 @xmath33    in principle equation ( [ eqconductivity ] ) holds for particles larger than 1 @xmath0 m . in the case of much smaller particles 
 , one should take into account that the contribution of the diffuse layer to the conductivity of the particles . noting that the smallest particles used in the experiments are 757 nm in diameter and that the conductivity of the de - ionised water is relatively low , neglect the double layer contribution and 
 thus use equation ( [ eqconductivity ] ) . 
 since the largest particles studied are 2070 nm in diameter and the frequency is 1 khz and the bulk ionic strength is @xmath34 mmol as determined from conductivity measurements , we work in the low frequency regime where the contributions from the conductivities dominate @xcite . 
 the clausius - mosotti factor therefore takes the following form :    @xmath35    due to the surface conductivity , @xmath30 is much larger than the conductivity of the medium @xmath36 . 
 the value of @xmath37 is therefore close to one . 
 we now combine the contributions from the electrostatic repulsions and the dipolar attractions , yielding the expression . 
 @xmath38    @xmath39 has the form indicated in fig . 
 we see a minimum in the potential , which one might expect to provide a first approximation to the lattice constant in the 2d colloidal crystal . in sections [ results ] and [ tunability ] we shall compare this minimum to our simulation results . 
 colloidal crystals underwent self - assembly as a result of an applied electric field . 
 we used anionic , sulphate stabilised polystyrene latex particles , either synthesised using a standard technique , surfactant free emulsion polymerisation @xcite in the case of @xmath40757 and 945 nm , or particles produced by the same method but purchased from microparticles gmbh for @xmath401390 and 2070 nm . 
 particle electrophoretic mobility was measured using a brookhaven zetaplus light scattering instrument . 
 particle sizes were determined by scanning electron microscopy , either in - house using a jeol jsm-6330f , in the case of @xmath40757 and 945 nm or by microparticles gmbh for @xmath401390 and 2070 nm are are listed in table [ tablekappasigma ] . 
 experiments were performed with dilute aqueous suspensions ( 0.5 - 1.5 wt% ) . 
 schematics of the experimental set up are shown in fig . 
 [ figschematic ] all glass surfaces were chemically washed with 0.1 m koh and washed with copious quantities of milliq water . 
 particles were deionised by direct contact with ion exchange beads before being made up to the desired electrolyte concentration with kcl . 
 very low salt conditions are required as even moderate ( mmol ) salt concentrations lead to electrohydrodynamic pattern formation due to ion flow @xcite . 
 for further details of the experimental set up and procedure the reader is referred to snoswell _ et . 
 _ @xcite . 
 we consider our experiment as a 2d system . 
 however , occasionally we noticed some overlap of the crystalline rafts . 
 we do not include these results in our analysis . in order to treat the system in 2d 
 , one might expect the gravitational length @xmath41 , where @xmath29 is the bouyant mass of the particle and @xmath42 is the acceleration due to gravity , to be much less than some characteristic length such as the particle diameter . due to the fairly small density mismatch between polystyrene and water , in fact even for the largest particles @xmath43 nm , @xmath44 . 
 however , the dipolar interactions between the particles are attractive in - plane , but strongly repulsive in the vertical direction . 
 this promotes the formation of ` rafts ' and ` sheets ' , and these large assemblies of many particles have very small gravitational lengths . 
 thus we argue that the system behaves in a quasi 2d manner . 
 the lattice parameter @xmath2 was taken as the average of typically ten crystalline ` rafts ' , measured across the ` raft ' , of around ten lattice spacings . the response to changing 
 the electric field strength was determined to be less than 100 ms , we waited 5s after changing the field strength before acquiring data . 
 we use standard monte - carlo ( mc ) simulations in the nvt ensemble @xcite . 
 the particles interact via equation ( [ equ ] ) in two dimensions . to mimic the experiments , we initialise the system in a random configuration at a relatively low concentration , corresponding to an area fraction @xmath45 . 
 we confirmed that different area fractions gave indistinguishable results , however smaller area fractions often led to longer equilibration times . 
 the attractive interactions cause the particles to approach one another , and form crystallites which then coalesce to form a crystalline ` rafts ' which contain of order @xmath46 particles , in a qualitatively similar way to the experimental system . 
 each simulation was equilibrated for typically 30000 mc moves per particle , followed by 3000 production moves per particle . 
 we recall that a potential of the form @xmath47 converges in 2d . 
 the lattice constant for this 2d hexagonal crystal was taken as    @xmath48    where @xmath49 is the pair correlation function , and @xmath50 the minimum between the first and second peaks of @xmath49 . 
 we found that when we used @xmath51 , that typically one crystalline domain was formed , around the centre of the simulation box . 
 we therefore do not use periodic boundary conditions , and consider the lattice spacing of the single crystal formed in the simulation . 
 one parameter is the number of particles typically present in each crystalline domain . 
 this is estimated to be around @xmath52@xmath53 from experimental data ( see fig . 
 [ figpix ] ) . 
 this value is governed by the overall concentration of the colloidal suspension . 
 we have considered the effects of varying @xmath54 as shown in fig . 
 [ figfinitesize ] . 
 the results of a considerable range of @xmath54 resulted in a variation of a around one percent in @xmath2 for the @xmath55 nm system for a field @xmath3=20 @xmath56 . 
 each simulation was repeated four times except @xmath57 . 
 we found a slight trend to tighter binding for larger @xmath54 , however , as shown in fig . 
 [ figfinitesize ] , this effect is rather small . 
 we henceforth use one simulation per state point unless otherwise stated . the slight scatter in the simulation data 
 is perhaps indicative the existence of different magic numbers for these crystalline rafts @xcite . 
 these may be thought of as 2d hexagonal clusters , whose ` magic numbers ' , ie low energy states , are expected to include @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 ... close to a ` magic number ' the binding may be expected to be relatively tighter . 
 a more detailed exploration of this phenomenon lies beyond the scope of this work . 
 overall , the variation in @xmath2 as a function of @xmath54 is smaller than the experimental scatter , nonetheless we take both @xmath61 and @xmath62 values for @xmath2 when comparing with experimental data . 
 the slightly larger value for @xmath63 in fig . 
 [ figfinitesize ] is attributed to the small size of the crystalline ` raft ' , such that the surface particles which are more widely spaced make a greater contribution . 
 the domain size is of order 100 particles , thus , for larger @xmath54 , defects and grain boundaries may lead to a smaller contribution to the measurement of @xmath2 . 
 this also applies to experimental data .    for fitting , 
 all parameters are known , except the debye length @xmath64 which we take as a free parameter for each particle size and salt concentration , although we note that the effective colloid charge is itself a function of the debye length , equation ( [ eqzeff ] ) . 
 it has previously been shown that comparison of simulation and experimental data can yield a reasonable _ local _ measure of the debye length @xcite . 
 furthermore , in the region of the sample in which the electric field is applied , the colloid volume fraction is much higher , and due to the colloidal counter - ions the ionic strength may increase , leading to a reduction in the debye length with respect to the bulk . 
 however , it is the debye length in this region which is relevant for the effective colloid - colloid interactions . the bulk debye length that may be determined , for example from conductivity measurements , 
 may therefore be taken only as an upper bound . 
 system parameters for different particle sizes are tabulated in table [ tablekappasigma ] , and the debye length is plotted in fig . [ figkappasigma](a ) and the contact potential of the yukawa interaction [ equation ( [ eqepsilonyuk ] ) ] in fig . [ 
 figkappasigma](b ) are plotted as a function of particle diameter . 
 clearly , our mc simulations may be expected to provide a reasonable treatment of the crystalline rafts in ( quasi ) equilibrium , rather than to describe the formation process . 
 we therefore restrict our analysis to a simple characterisation of the crystal rafts , and primarily consider the lattice spacing . 
 we furthermore note both here and in previous work @xcite that considerable variation in shapes of crystalline rafts was observed , but that this had little impact upon the measurement of the lattice spacing @xmath2 . likewise , at the level of this work , we neglect possible local variations in @xmath2 due to the proximity of an interface . in any case 
 we note that for display applications , all lattice spacings contribute to the diffraction . 
 a few words on equilibration are in order . 
 this applies both to the experimental system , and to the simulations . 
 neither system is strictly in equilibrium , in that case we might expect a rather regularly - shaped raft such as a hexagon . 
 however , the insensitivity of the lattice parameter either as a function of @xmath54 ( fig . 
 [ figfinitesize ] ) , and the very close agreement between statistically independent simulation runs lead us to conclude that our approach is sufficient to compare lattice parameters between experiment and simulation . 
 the effect of changing the electric field strength is readily demonstrated in fig . [ figpix ] , which shows optical microscope images of the region of the sample in which the field is applied . 
 two field strengths are shown , 29 kvm@xmath65 ( a ) and 80 kvm@xmath65 ( b ) for @xmath55 nm and we see a correspondingly tighter lattice in the case of the higher field strength . 
 similar behaviour was observed in @xcite . 
 figure [ figpix](c ) illustrates simulated coordinates for @xmath66@xmath67 @xmath68 , @xmath69 , @xmath70@xmath71 @xmath68 , which corresponds to @xmath3=29.0 vm@xmath65for the @xmath55 nm system ( see table [ tablekappasigma ] ) .    a more quantitative comparison between experiment and simulation is shown in fig . 
 [ figg ] , which plots the radial distribution function @xmath49 . 
 we see that the structure appears to be crystalline , with reasonably long - ranged correlations , although , as is clear from fig . 
 [ figpix ] , the system is too small to test for truly long - ranged order . 
 we thus note that it is difficult to distinguish the true crystal from a hexatic phase in this system . 
 however , our motivation is to model the experimental system , with @xmath72 and thus we argue that identification of the hexatic phase lies beyond the scope of this work . 
 having illustrated the general behaviour of the system , we now turn our attention to the fitting of the experimental data , with the model described in section ii . 
 the experimental data was fitted to the theory by taking the debye - length as the fitting parameter . 
 the main results are shown in figs . 
 [ figsmallexpmc ] and [ figbigexpmc ] for @xmath73 and 945 nm , and @xmath74 and 2070 nm systems respectively . 
 these concern the lattice parameter @xmath2 as a function of applied field strength @xmath3 . in general , 
 the simulation is able to capture the behaviour of the system in a reasonably quantitative manner . 
 furthermore , simply plotting the minimum in the potential @xmath75 given by equation ( [ equ ] ) provides a first approximation to the lattice constant @xmath2 . 
 figure @xmath76(a ) shows the results for @xmath73 nm particles . due to the small particle size , and the inverse cubic dependence of the strength of the dipolar attractions on the particle diameter , as characterised by @xmath77 [ equation ( [ eqepsilondip ] ) ] 
 the attraction for a given field strength is comparitively small , so we find relatively larger lattice parameters for this system . at low field strengths ( @xmath78 @xmath56 ) 
 we see an increase of the lattice constant for both the experimental data and the simulation , compared to the minimum in the potential . 
 apparently , as the crystal approaches melting , fluctuations become more pronounced , leading to an increase in @xmath2 , which is not captured in equation ( [ equ ] ) , or perhaps a molten surface layer increases the apparent value of @xmath2 . 
 we leave this intriguing question for further investigations . 
 meanwhile , at high field strengths , we find some deviation between simulation , experiment and equation ( [ equ ] ) . apparently , due to the long ranged nature of the interaction , second nearest neighbours experience an attraction of sufficient strength that the crystal is compressed by its own cohesion , leading to a smaller lattice constant . 
 in the case of the @xmath73 nm particles , we find that for small field strengths , ( @xmath79 @xmath56 ) , the system does not form crystallites , rather it remains as a colloidal liquid . 
 we determined this both by experimental observation and with simulations . in the latter case , we identified crystallisation with a splitting in the second peak of the pair correlation function @xmath49 . 
 the kink around @xmath80 @xmath56 in fig . 
 [ figsmallexpmc ] is likely related an artifact of measuring multiple rafts , so defects and grain boundaries contribute to the value of @xmath2 . at weak field strengths the rafts 
 tend to be smaller , thus increasing this effect .    at larger particle sizes , ( fig . 
 [ figbigexpmc ] ) , we again see reasonable agreement between experiment and simulation , albeit with some deviation between simulation and equation ( [ equ ] ) at higher field strengths , as the simulation predicts a smaller lattice constant than that observed in the experiments . 
 however , for the @xmath74 nm system in particular , in fact equation ( [ equ ] ) provides a more accurate description of the experimental data . apparently some of our assumptions in the simulations , perhaps that of pairwise additivity , begin to break down at high field strengths . according to equation ( [ equ ] ) , 
 the potential at the minimum of the attractive well is some 250 @xmath68 for an applied field of 50 kvm@xmath65 for @xmath74 nm . thus we conclude that for moderate interaction strengths , equation ( [ equ ] ) provides a reasonable description of the system . 
 we now consider the dependence of the system upon the colloid diameter @xmath8 . 
 firstly , we see from fig . 
 [ figkappasigma](a ) that the absolute value of the ( fitted ) debye length @xmath64 does not change significantly for all the four particle sizes studied . 
 thus , the reduced inverse debye length @xmath81 is linear in @xmath8 . 
 the contact potential @xmath82 has an approximately inverse cubic dependence on @xmath8 for @xmath81@xmath83 , equation ( [ eqepsilonyuk ] ) , but also depends upon the ( effective ) charge @xmath16 . 
 plotting @xmath82 as a function of @xmath8 in fig . [ 
 figkappasigma](b ) we find an approximate power law dependence with an exponent of @xmath84 . 
 as noted above , the prefactor of the dipolar attraction , @xmath77 [ equation ( [ eqepsilondip ] ) ] , has a @xmath85 dependence . 
 although the electrostatic interactions are non - negligible , we nonetheless expect from equation ( [ eqepsilondip ] ) that upon decreasing @xmath8 we find a relatively larger lattice constant for a given field strength , and that larger field strengths are required to provide sufficient interactions that the crystalline rafts form . 
 this we indeed find , as shown in figs . 
 [ figsmallexpmc ] and [ figbigexpmc ] , and also in the next section . 
 now we have noted that this system has optical display applications , due to the possibility of externally tuning the lattice parameter @xmath2 . 
 these applications may be most usefully realised when the possibility to tune the system is maximised , ie when the range of @xmath2 is maximised . 
 we are therefore motivated to consider a range of particle sizes , and calculate the range of tunability of @xmath2 . 
 now @xmath8 sets a lower bound to @xmath2 while the upper bound is set by the melting transition which can be determined by monte - carlo simulation . 
 hitherto , we have used the debye length @xmath64 as a fitting parameter . however , as fig . 
 [ figkappasigma](a ) shows , there is relatively little change in the absolute value of the debye length for the range of colloid diameters investigated . 
 we therefore fix @xmath86 nm and vary the colloid size , and apply the same methodology as that outlined in sections [ theory ] and [ simulation ] , in calculating the response for @xmath87 nm colloids to an external electric field . 
 while an accurate determination of the melting transition is complicated by the small system size , melting is approximately determined by the splitting of the second peak in the radial distribution function @xmath49 @xcite . 
 we decrease the electric field to identify the weakest field at which the second peak in @xmath49 exhibits clear splitting [ fig . 
 [ figtuning](a ) , inset ] , thus yielding @xmath88 , the lattice spacing just prior to melting . 
 the melting value of the lattice parameter @xmath89 is taken as    @xmath90    where @xmath91 is the amount by which the field strength is varied between simulations , typically @xmath92 @xmath56 . 
 the error in @xmath89 is then taken as @xmath2@xmath93 .    in terms of the particle diameter 
 , @xmath89 grows considerably at small sizes , as the relatively larger debye length leads to a minimum in the effective potential at relatively larger distances . 
 however , we recall that our analysis suggests a roughly @xmath94 dependence of @xmath77 the strength of the dipolar attraction . 
 this suggests that we might expect a stronger electric field to be required for relatively small colloids , and indeed we find that a higher field is required to provide sufficient cohesive energy to hold the colloids together in the crystal - like ` rafts ' , so at 100 @xmath56 , a value we take as a reasonably accessible maximum field strength , the lattice spacing is still around @xmath95@xmath8 for @xmath96 @xmath97 , where @xmath98 is the lattice spacing corresponding to a field strength of 100 @xmath56 . 
 conversely , at larger particle sizes , the debye length is relatively small , so we find , even at melting , that the lattice constant only approaches around @xmath99@xmath8 . 
 we note that , at high field strengths , the assumptions of section [ theory ] will ultimately break down . 
 the results presented in figs . [ figsmallexpmc ] and [ figbigexpmc ] show that @xmath100 @xmath56 is reasonable , at least for @xmath101 nm , supporting our conclusion of a maximum in tuneability around @xmath99@xmath8 . 
 we show the values of the well depth of equation ( [ equ ] ) at melting for the different experimental system in table [ tablekappasigma ] , which indicates a trend towards deeper wells for larger particles , i.e. shorter ranges of the repulsive interaction relative to the particle size . 
 larger field strengths may be expected to yield greater tunability for the small particle sizes . since the overall minimum lattice spacing is @xmath102 , in principle smaller particles have greater tunability 
 , however experimental observations reveal intense fluid turbulance disrupts crystal formation at higher field strengths . 
 this is caused by large field gradients at the electrode edges that induce strong dielectrophoretic forces . 
 in addition , higher field strengths can cause bubble formation by electrolysis and electrochemical degradation of the electrodes . 
 the result is thus that intermediate particle sizes have the highest degree of tuneability , for a given maximum field strength . 
 here we have considered 100 @xmath56 , which leads to a maximum tuneability of @xmath103 in the range 1000 nm @xmath1041500 nm . 
 2d colloidal crystalline ` rafts ' with externally controllable properties have been modeled with monte - carlo simulations , and the resulting lattice constant , both experimental and simulated , has been compared to the minimum in the effective interaction potential . in treating the effective colloidal interactions , we find that a straightforward , pairwise approach provides a reasonable description in describing the lattice parameter . 
 the minimum in the effective interaction formed from combining the electrostatic repulsions and dipolar attractions is a useful means to approximate the lattice parameter , although close to melting fluctuations lead to a larger value in the lattice parameter than this minimum . 
 conversely , at high field strengths , our treatment appears to be less accurate . 
 apparently , higher order terms which we have not accounted for may become important , such as non - linear poisson - boltzmann contributions to the electrostatic interactions , leading to a deviations from the yukawa form [ equation ( [ eqyuk ] ) ] @xcite or limitations in our pairwise treatment of the dipolar attractions @xcite . 
 other possibilities include inaccuracies in our assumptions for the effective colloid charge [ equation ( [ eqzeff ] ) ] , limitations of the 2d behaviour of the experimental system . perhaps due to a cancellation of errors , at high field strengths , 
 the minimum in the effective interaction can sometimes provide a more accurate value of the lattice parameter than the simulations . 
 another important assumption lies in our derivation on the electrostatic interactions . 
 while their yukawa - like form is well - accepted @xcite , the values the effective colloid charge comes from equation ( [ eqzeff ] ) . 
 we note that the debye length we determine seems rather constant across the four particle sizes considered , [ fig.[figkappasigma ] ( a ) ] , which suggests that out approach is at least consistent . 
 however challenging it may be , a more quantitative measurement of the local ion concentration in the vicinity of the crystalline rafts is desirable and will be considered in the future . 
 furthermore , there may be some variation in the value of @xmath16 . 
 in fact this should affect all state points in a similar manner ( for each particle size ) , and therefore we anticipate a similar outcome , but that a different value might be arrived at in the fitting of the debye length , however , owing to the relatively short - ranged nature of the interaction , the effect of a different value for the effective charge is unlikely to impinge significantly the debye length and should have a negligible effect on our main results . 
 we have also assumed that a given system is described by _ _ 
 one single__debye length . 
 in fact , in the counterion - dominated regime , the debye length is in fact a function of colloid concentration @xcite , an effect we have neglected . 
 this might lead to a tightening at higher colloid concentration ( i.e. high field strength ) , which may be expected to lead to an increase in deviation with the experimental results ( figs . 
 [ figsmallexpmc ] and [ figbigexpmc ] ) . 
 nevertheless , varying the debye length as a function of local colloid concentration would be worth considering in the future . 
 we have extended our approach a range of colloid size , to optimise the lattice tuneability for display applications . 
 tunable 2d crystal rafts can behave as tunable diffraction gratings capable of filtering white light into visible colours@xcite . 
 similar tunable diffraction has been proposed for display devices @xcite.the range of colours obtainable for a given geometry is governed by the lattice tunability . 
 fig 9b demonstrates that lattice tunability in our system is maximised for particles of approximately 1 to 1.5 microns . 
 only higher field strengths applied to smaller particles can increase the lattice tunability . 
 as already indicated , higher field strengths are not practical in the current experimental system , however in future experiments metal coated colloids would exhibit much stronger dipolar interactions , enabling a reduction in field strength for a given attraction . 
 regardless , our methodology illustrates using the well - developed machinery of effective colloidal interactions , as a means to model potentially complex interactions , useful for engineering purposes .

"the micro - quasar grs 1915 + 105 is an enigmatic black hole binary ( bhb ) exhibiting enormous variability which have been classified in more than 14 different variability classes @xcite . 
 it is believed that the extreme variability and rapid state changes observed in grs 1915 + 105 are due to a very high accretion rate , which is close to , or at times higher than , the eddington accretion rate @xcite . 
 it is also known for exhibiting large superluminal radio flares and steady radio emission which are always associated with specific x - ray variability classes @xcite . 
 such an extreme and correlated multi - wavelength variability makes grs 1915 + 105 a unique bhb . in this context , igr j170913624 , 
 a new x - ray transient source believed to be a bhb , generated considerable interest recently . 
 it was detected by integral / ibis in 2003 @xcite . 
 it has exhibited repeated outbursts with periods of two to four years in 1994 , 1996 , 2001 , 2003 , 2007 , and 2011 @xcite . 
 the recent 2011 outburst of igr j170913624 was unusually long and the source was found to be active even after one year @xcite . during this outburst , 
 igr j170913624 revealed its highly variable nature and showed variability patterns so far observed only in grs 1915 + 105 . 
 the most prominent of these patterns was the ` heartbeat ' pattern , similar to the @xmath0-class in grs 1915 + 105 . 
 @xcite documented the first six months of rxte observations and showed that not only @xmath0-class but many other variability patterns similar to @xmath1- , @xmath5- , @xmath6- , @xmath7- , @xmath8- , and @xmath9- classes have been observed during this outburst of igr j170913624 . 
 @xcite also detected a high frequency quasi - periodic oscillation ( hfqpo ) in this source with a frequency of 66 hz , which is almost identical to the frequency of hfqpo in grs 1915 + 105 . despite striking morphological similarities , 
 the most perplexing difference between the two sources lies in their observed intensities . 
 while grs 1915 + 105 is one of the brightest x - ray sources with a typical brightness of @xmath100.5  2 crab , igr j170913624 is about 20 times fainter . in the present scenario , 
 mass , distance , and inclination for this source are rather poorly constrained , with reports so far suggesting a mass range of <3 m@xmath4 @xcite to @xmath1015 m@xmath4 @xcite and a distance range of @xmath1011 kpc @xcite to @xmath1020 kpc @xcite . nevertheless , the apparent faintness of igr j170913624 is difficult to explain even after assuming the smallest possible mass of 3 @xmath11 for a black hole @xcite and the largest possible distance of @xmath1025 kpc for a galactic source . 
 here , we attempt to investigate the possible reasons for this apparent faintness of igr j170913624 by simultaneously fitting spectra at different phases . 
 the main idea is that the system parameters can not change over the phase of the oscillations . 
 therefore , a simultaneous fitting of spectra at different phases , with system parameters tied across phases , may put a better constraint on them . 
 this , along with a proposal that the ` heartbeats ' can be used as a ` standard candle ' , leads to a primary conclusion that the faintness of igr j170913624 is due to its low or negative spin . 
 we have used data from long simultaneous observations of igr j170913624 made on 2011 march 27 with rxte ( obsid : 96420 - 01 - 05 - 000 , total exposure @xmath1021 ks ) and xmm - newton ( obsid : 0677980201 , total exposure @xmath1039 ks ) with net simultaneous exposure of @xmath1015 ks . 
 the data reduction for the rxte / pca observation was carried out with heasoft version 6.8 following standard analysis procedure for good xenon data . 
 we extracted 1 s light curve from pcu2 data . 
 it showed the typical @xmath1-class oscillations with periods ranging from 30 to 50 s ( figure 1 ) . 
 it contained a total of 385 bursts . 
 we carried out ` phase - resolved ' spectroscopy for these bursts in the energy range of 3.035.0 kev for rxte / pca and 0.712.0 kev for xmm / pn data as described below . 
 the peak time for each burst was identified in a semiautomatic manner using an idl script and the peak - to - peak interval between consecutive bursts was divided into 64 phases of equal length . 
 the start and stop times of each phase , recorded in rxte mission time for 385 bursts , were used for extracting spectra for each phase . 
 total counts for all 64 spectra and their corresponding exposure times were then used to generate the ` phase - folded ' light curve ( figure 2 ) . 
 the 64 phase bins were grouped into five phases as shown in figure 2 and the spectra extracted for these five phases were used for simultaneous spectral fitting . 
 the grouping was carried out mainly by the visual inspection of the folded rxte / pca lightcurve . 
 the xmm observation was carried out in the _ fast timing _ 
 mode of epic - mos and the _ burst _ mode of epic - pn and we followed the standard analysis procedures for these modes using _ 
 sas v11.0.0 _ and the latest calibration files . 
 we used data from xmm - pn only because mos2 data could not be checked for possible pileup ( generation of pattern plot always resulted in error ) whereas mos1 data are not useful in timing mode because of a dead pixel in the ccd . for pn data , 
 the observed and the expected pattern behavior differed below 0.7 kev and hence the energy range for rest of the analysis was restricted to 0.712.0 kev . 
 start and stop times of the 64 phases of all bursts from rxte mission were converted into xmm mission time using the _ xtime _ tool , available at heasarc , which were used to build gti files using sas task _ 
 gtibuild_. these gti files were used for extracting the 64 phase spectra using the task _ evselect_. the ` phase - folded ' light curve was generated using the total counts and the exposure times , as described earlier . 
 the subtle features were averaged out as a consequence of the quasi - periodicity and co - adding , but the overall profile of the ` phase - folded ' light curve followed a typical burst cycle . 
 further , it was seen that the oscillations were more pronounced in the xmm light curve indicating that the accretion disk radiation was primarily participating in the oscillations and not the comptonized emission from the corona which dominates at higher energies . 
 source spectra from the five grouped phases were extracted using rawx columns between 32 and 42 for single and double pixel events ( pattern @xmath124 ) . 
 sas tools _ rmfgen _ and _ arfgen _ were used to generate redistribution matrices and ancillary files , respectively , and the same files were used for the spectra of all phases . 
 the background spectrum was extracted from rawx columns between 5 and 7 after confirming that the region was not contaminated significantly with source photons in the selected energy range . 
 a single background spectrum was used for the five phases . 
 all spectra were rebinned using sastask _ 
 specgroup _ to have a minimum of 25 counts per channel . 
 once we extracted the spectra for the five phases for both pca and pn , the 10 spectra were fitted simultaneously with various parameters tied as follows . 
 the 10 spectra were loaded into xspec as 10 data groups . for a given phase , all parameters for pca and pn 
 spectra were tied together except the normalization constant which was frozen at 1.0 for pn whereas for pca it was kept free but tied across the five phases . for a particular spectral model , we tied all parameters representing system property , such as mass , distance , inclination , spin or combination of these , across the five phases . 
 the parameters describing the accretion process such as inner disk temperature or accretion rate , inner disk radius , were fitted independently for each phase . 
 wide - band x - ray spectrum of a black hole binary generally consists of two dominant components : a multi - color disk and a high - energy tail arising from compton scattering in an optically thin region surrounding the disk . 
 we used diskpn @xcite as a simplified disk model , primarily because its parameters are cleanly separated in accretion - process - dependent parameters ( disk temperature and inner disk radius ) and system parameters ( normalization ) . for a general relativistic description of the multi - temperature disk spectrum , we used kerrbb @xcite , which is widely used for its accurate modeling of disk spectrum and to investigate black hole spin 
 the high - energy tail of the spectrum is typically modeled as powerlaw to approximate the comptonized component . 
 however , @xcite proposed a more physical model simpl to empirically describe the comptonized component . here , 
 we have used simpl along with one of the two disk models ( diskpn and kerrbb ) to fit the spectra in the five phases simultaneously , as described below .          for the first part of the analysis 
 , we fitted rxte - pca and xmm - pn spectra for the five phases simultaneously with const*phabs*(simpl@xmath13diskpn ) . 
 the parameter const was used to account for possible calibration uncertainties between the two instruments . 
 normalizations of diskpn were tied across the five phases , whereas rest of the parameters were allowed to vary independently . 
 though the interstellar absorption can be considered as a part of system parameters , we allowed it to vary to account for any phase - dependent absorption intrinsic to the source . 
 we , however , found that the n@xmath14 values for the five phases were not significantly different and the fitted values of n@xmath14 were in agreement with the values reported by @xcite and @xcite . 
 table 1 provides the results of spectral fits . 
 it can be seen that the inner disk temperature is highest for phase 1 corresponding to the peak of the bursts , implying higher accretion rate as expected . 
 we verified that neither the fe - line nor the reflection component was required to fit the data . 
 a best fit was obtained with @xmath15 value of 1709.0 for 1030 degrees of freedom . however , for the present work , more important is the best - fit value of diskpn normalization , @xmath16 , as it can provide some constraints on mass ( @xmath17 ) , distance ( @xmath18 ) , and inclination ( @xmath2 ) . 
 the best fit value of diskpn normalization was found to be @xmath19 . assuming a minimum mass of @xmath103 m@xmath4 and a maximum distance of @xmath1025 kpc for a galactic black hole candidate along with a standard value for color correction factor , @xmath20 
 , the best - fit value of @xmath21 resulted in a lower limit on inclination angle of 76@xmath3 . 
 considering the 90% upper confidence limit of @xmath22 for the normalization , the lowest possible inclination angle was @xmath1053@xmath3 . 
 this lower limit comes only from simultaneous spectral fitting and it is not dependent on any additional information , and hence it can be considered as fairly robust . since spectral fitting could not constrain lower limit of n@xmath23 , it was not possible to obtain an upper limit on @xmath2 with spectral fitting . 
 however , simultaneous spectral analysis with diskpn to model accretion disk spectra suggests that igr j170913624 is a high inclination binary . 
 this is consistent with the finding of @xcite and @xcite .    , scattering fraction ( f@xmath24 ) , n@xmath14 , and @xmath25 for all combinations of @xmath18 , @xmath17 , @xmath2 and @xmath26 . 
 the parameters are more or less similar for any combination of system parameters and hence distinction between them is not made . 
 error bars ( 90% confidence ) are shown with gray and only a subset of data are shown here.,width=453,height=453 ]          in the second part , we fitted the spectra using the model cons*phabs*(simpl@xmath13kerrbb ) . apart from mass , distance , inclination , and spin as independent fit parameters , kerrbb has parameters governing the second - order effects such as ` spectral hardening factor ' , ` returning radiation ' and ` limb darkening ' . 
 we , however , froze these parameters to their default values . 
 typically kerrbb is used for disk - dominated spectra with luminosity < 0.3 @xmath27 , however , @xcite have shown that simpl@xmath13kerrbb can be used to accurately describe spectra with higher luminosities as well . in this case , we tied all kerrbb parameters except n@xmath14 and mass accretion rate across the five phases . 
 further , the normalization was frozen to 1.0 . 
 since all system parameters can not be fitted simultaneously , we selected specific values for mass , inclination , and spin and fitted for mass accretion rate and distance . in order to systematically investigate the parameter space 
 , we varied the black hole mass from 3 @xmath11 to 20 @xmath11 , inclination angle from @xmath28 to @xmath29 , and spin from 0 to 0.9 . 
 results of this analysis have been shown in figures 3 and 4 . 
 figure 3 shows variation of interstellar absorption , n@xmath14 , two parameters of simpl  power - law index , @xmath30 and the scattering fraction , @xmath31 , and fit statistic , @xmath32 for the five phases . 
 since these parameters are more or less the same for any combination of system parameters ( mass , distance , inclination , and spin ) , these are shown without any distinction . 
 again it was found that neither the fe - line nor the reflection component is required for fitting data with the f - test chance improvement probability being > 88% for all combinations of mass , distance , and inclination . for a combination of mass @xmath17 , inclination @xmath2 ( > 50@xmath3 ) , and spin @xmath26 , 
 the fitted values of distance @xmath18 ( top panel ) and mass accretion rate @xmath33 ( bottom panel ) have been shown in figure  [ mdplot ] . 
 only maximum ( phase 1 ) and minimum ( phase 3 ) mass accretion rates have been shown in figure  [ mdplot ] for the sake of clarity . 
 error bars ( 90% confidence limit ) are smaller than the symbols for most of the points in plot . 
 this indicates that the distance and the accretion rate are very well constrained for a given combination of system parameters . 
 figure  [ mdplot ] can be used to put some significant limits on the spin of the black hole with some independent constraints on either black hole mass or distance . 
 one such independent constraint comes from the total luminosity argument during ` heartbeat ' oscillations . 
 @xcite studied such oscillations in grs 1915 + 105 and suggested that the radiation pressure instability augmented by the local eddington limit within inner accretion disk as the origin of such variability pattern . 
 however , this mechanism requires high accretion rate . 
 @xcite showed that during the peak of ` heartbeat ' , the bolometric disk luminosity is typically as high as 80%90 % of the eddington luminosity . given the similarity between the variability patterns in grs 1915 + 105 and igr j170913624 , it is natural to assume a similar mechanism operating in both the sources . in this way 
 , the observed flux during the peak of the ` heartbeat ' oscillations can be used to estimate the distance for a given mass or in other words ` heartbeat ' can be used as a standard candle in order to constrain the parameters . 
 we found the best - fit value of the peak bolometric flux as 4.10 @xmath34 erg s@xmath35@xmath36 . 
 figure 1 shows that the peak flux in individual bursts is not the same and there is a burst - to - burst variation in the peak flux values . 
 therefore , we have assumed the range of peak flux to be ( 3.0  5.0 ) @xmath34 erg s@xmath35 @xmath36 and a more conservative range of peak luminosity to be 60%-90% of eddington luminosity . 
 thus the obtained possible @xmath37 range is shown as a gray area in the top left corner of figure  [ mdplot ] . 
 it can be seen that the points within this region correspond to inclination angle < 60@xmath3 and spin < 0.2 . 
 however , the lower limit on inclination was found to be @xmath1076@xmath3 from diskpn normalization . 
 this presents a tantalizing possibility of black hole spin to be retrograde indicating a black hole spin in opposite direction to the accretion disk . 
 further , we have found a lower limit of @xmath1053@xmath3 on inclination angle from 90% upper confidence limit of diskpn normalization . 
 the points corresponding to @xmath3850@xmath3 require spin to be < 0.2 . 
 thus we exclude the possibility of high spin and it appears that the main reason for the observed faintness of igr j170913624 is very low ( or even negative ) spin of the black hole , in contrast to grs 1915 + 105 , which is known to have a very high spin @xcite . 
 it can be seen that even for the exotic type of black hole with mass <3 @xmath11 @xcite , this inference on black hole spin remains valid . 
 further , in order to verify the effect of other frozen parameters of kerrbb , such as returning radiation , limb darkening , and inner boundary stress , we have also enabled all of them ( one by one as well as all together ) and found that the lines corresponding to a particular combination of spin and inclination angle move away from the shaded region . 
 we verified that the same is valid when powerlaw is used instead of simpl . 
 thus for any combination of these parameters or model for the high - energy tail , the black hole spin is required to be either very low or negative . 
 the 66 hz hfqpo of igr j170913624 detected by @xcite may also be considered as an independent constraint on black hole mass , if it is assumed to be related to mass . in this case , 
 the black hole mass in igr j170913624 has to be @xmath39 . 
 for such a high black hole mass , figure 4(a ) does not provide any constraint on the distance , however , both the inclination angle and the spin are required to be > 70@xmath3 and > 0.7 , respectively . for these high values of inclination angle and spin , figure 4(b ) shows that the required accretion rate is only a small fraction of the eddington accretion rate . 
 thus , if we assume that the 66 hz qpo is related to the black hole mass , the basic accretion process giving rise to the apparent similar variability of grs 1915 + 105 and igr j170913624 has to be different . 
 however , it is more likely , as also suggested by @xcite , that the 66 hz hfqpo is not directly related to the black hole mass . in that case , the previous argument for a low black hole mass based on the apparent flux and similar accretion process between igr j170913624 and grs 1915 + 105 holds , and the inference of low or negative spin remains valid . 
 overall this work indicates that the black hole spin may not play a significant role in generating the observed extreme variability and such a behavior is generated mainly by a high accretion rate .

 grs 1915 + 105 was so far the only bhb exhibiting extreme variability and spectral changes over timescales as short as a few tens of seconds . 
 observations of similar variability in another bhb igr j170913624 establishes that such extreme variability of grs 1915 + 105 is not due to some specific coincidences unique to one particular bhb , but is a more generic phenomenon . here , we presented results of simultaneous fitting of 0.735.0 kev spectra during different phases of the ` heartbeat ' oscillations in igr j170913624 , which indicate that the most likely difference between grs 1915 + 105 and igr j170913624 is in the spins of the respective black holes . 
 while the black hole in grs 1915 + 105 is known to be rotating with high spin , the black hole in igr j170913624 is found to have a very low spin . 
 in fact , for inclination @xmath1070@xmath3 , which is favored by the data , the black hole could very well have a retrograde spin . in this case 
 , igr j170913624 would be the first known astrophysical source having a retrograde spin . 
 even though theoretically possible , such a scenario would be very challenging to explain from the point of view of evolution of such a system . 
 this research has made use of data obtained from high energy astrophysics science archive research center ( heasarc ) , provided by nasa s goddard space flight center . 
 we thank a. r. rao for useful discussions . 
 we also thank the anonymous referee for very useful comments .","igr j170913624 is a transient x - ray source and is believed to be a galactic black hole candidate . 
 recently , it has received a considerable attention due to the detection of peculiar variability patterns known as ` heartbeats ' , which are quasi - periodic mini - outbursts repeated over timescales ranging between 5 and 70 s. so far , such variability patterns have been observed only in grs 1915 + 105 and these are classified as @xmath0- and @xmath1-variability classes . here , we present the results of ` phase - resolved ' spectroscopy of the ` heartbeat ' oscillations of igr j170913624 using data from simultaneous observations made by rxte and xmm - newton . 
 we find that the 0.735 kev spectra can be fitted with a ` canonical ' model for black hole sources consisting of only two components  a multi - temperature disk black body and a power law ( or its equivalent ) . 
 we attempt to constrain the system parameters of the source by simultaneously fitting spectra during different phases of the burst profile while tying the system parameters across the phases . 
 the results indicate that the source is a high inclination binary ( @xmath2>53@xmath3 ) . 
 further , the observed low flux from the source can be explained only if the black hole spin is very low , along with constraints on the black hole mass ( < 5 m@xmath4 ) and the distance ( > 20 kpc ) . for higher inclination angles , which is favored by the data , 
 the black hole spin is required to be negative . thus low or retrograde 
 spin could be the reason for the low luminosity of the source .",arxiv
"the phase - field method has become the method of choice for simulating microstructure formation during solidification . 
 it owes its popularity mainly to its algorithmic simplicity : the cumbersome problem of tracking moving solid - liquid interfaces or grain boundaries is avoided by describing the geometry in terms of one or several phase fields . 
 the phase fields obey simple partial differential equations that can be easily coded by standard numerical methods . 
 the foundations of the phase - field method and its application to solidification have been the subject of several recent review articles @xcite , and it seems of little use to repeat similar information here . instead , in this paper 
 several topics are discussed where robust phase - field modelling tools are not yet available because some fundamental questions remain open . in sec . 
 [ sec2 ] , the thin - interface limit of two - sided phase - field models is examined , and it is shown that the currently available approaches can not in general eliminate all effects linked to the finite interface thickness . in sec . 
 [ sec3 ] , orientation - field models for polycrystalline solidification are discussed , and it is shown that the standard equation of motion usually written down for the orientation field is not appropriate for the evolution of coherent crystalline matter . 
 finally , in sec .  [ sec4 ] , the inclusion of microscopic fluctuations in the phase - field equations is reviewed , and it is shown that the standard approach can not be used in a straightforward way to investigate the process of nucleation .    the common point of these topics is that they pose challenges or limitations for straightforward computations . 
 indeed , a characteristic feature of the phase - field method is that its equations can often be written down following simple rules or intuition , but that their detailed properties ( which have to be known if quantitative simulations are desired ) become only apparent through a mathematical analysis that can be quite involved . 
 therefore , it is not always easy to perceive the limits of applicability of the method . 
 it is hoped that the present contribution will be helpful to point out some pitfalls and to stimulate further discussions that will facilitate the solution of these issues . 
 the precision and performance of phase - field models have been greatly enhanced in the last decade by a detailed control of their properties . 
 phase - field models are rooted in the mean - field description of spatially diffuse interfaces by order parameters . however , to be useful for simulating microstructure formation in solidification , phase - field models need to bridge the scale gap between the thickness of the physical solid - liquid interfaces and the typical scale of the microstructures . 
 this is achieved by increasing the interface width in the model , sometimes by several orders of magnitude . 
 obviously , this procedure magnifies any physical effect that is due to the diffuseness of the interface . 
 therefore , to guarantee precise simulations , all these effects have to be controlled and , if possible , eliminated . the privileged tool to achieve 
 this is the so - called _ thin - interface limit _ : 
 the equations of the phase - field model are analysed under the assumption that the interface thickness is much smaller than any other physical length scale present in the problem , but otherwise arbitrary . 
 the procedure of matched asymptotic expansions then yields the effective boundary conditions valid at the macroscale , which contain all effects of the finite interface thickness up to the order to which the expansions are carried out . 
 this procedure was pioneered by karma and rappel , who analysed the symmetric model of solidification ( equal diffusion constants in the solid and the liquid ) and obtained a thin - interface correction to the expression of the kinetic coefficient @xcite . 
 the use of this result has made it possible to carry out quantitative simulations of free dendritic growth of a pure substance , both at high and low undercoolings @xcite . 
 it turned out , however , that the generalisation of this method to a model with arbitrary diffusivities is far from trivial @xcite , since several new thin - interface effects appear , which can not all be eliminated simultaneously . 
 a solution to this problem was found later for the case of the one - sided model ( zero diffusivity in the solid ) with the introduction of the so - called antitrapping current @xcite , and it was shown that quantitative simulations of alloy solidification are possible with this model @xcite , including multi - phase @xcite and multi - component alloys @xcite . 
 recently , several extensions of the antitrapping current were put forward to generalise the approach to the case of finite diffusivity in the solid @xcite , and simulations were presented which show that the approach works well for the instability of a steady - state planar interface @xcite and for free dendritic growth @xcite . however , as will be shown below , this is only a partial solution to the problem of developing a general quantitative model , since there is a second , independent thin - interface effect that can not be removed by an antitrapping current , namely , the kapitza resistance .    for the sake of concreteness , consider the standard phase - field model for the solidification of a pure substance as discussed in refs . 
 the evolution equation for the phase field reads @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the phase field , with @xmath2 and @xmath3 corresponding to solid and liquid , respectively , @xmath4 is the relaxation time of the phase field , @xmath5 is the interface thickness , and @xmath6 is a dimensionless coupling constant . the field @xmath7 is a dimensionless temperature defined by @xmath8 , where @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the melting temperature , latent heat , and specific heat , respectively . 
 it is assumed for simplicity that @xmath11 is the same in both phases . 
 the temperature is governed by a diffusion equation with a source term , @xmath12     + \frac 12 \partial_t h(\phi ) . 
 \label{diffusion}\ ] ] here , @xmath13 , which satisfies @xmath14 , is a function that describes the release or consumption of latent heat during the phase transition , and @xmath15 interpolates between the thermal diffusivities of the liquid and the solid , @xmath16 and @xmath17 , @xmath18 where the interpolation function @xmath19 satisfies @xmath20 and @xmath21 . for simplicity , 
 crystalline anisotropy has not been included in the above model because it is not necessary for the present discussion . 
 furthermore , the equations have been stated in the language of a two - sided thermal model , but with some modifications ( as detailed in refs . 
 @xcite ) , they also apply to the isothermal solidification of a binary alloy . in this case , @xmath7 is a dimensionless chemical potential ( conjugate to the concentration of one of the alloy components ) , and @xmath15 is the chemical diffusivity .    in the following 
 , two simple one - dimensional solutions of these equations will be analysed . 
 the first is a steady - state planar front that propagates with constant velocity @xmath22 in the positive @xmath23 direction into a liquid of undercooling @xmath24 ( @xmath25 for @xmath26 ) , and leaves behind a constant temperature . 
 this solution only exists if the liquid is undercooled beyond the hypercooling limit , that is , @xmath27 . 
 the sharp - interface solution to this problem is readily obtained and reads @xmath28 for an interface located at @xmath29 ( in the frame moving with the interface ) . here , 
 @xmath30 and @xmath31 are the limit values of the temperature when the interface is approached from the solid and the liquid side , respectively . in the standard formulation of the free boundary problem of solidification 
 , it is assumed that the temperature is the same on the two sides of the interface , @xmath32 . then , the use of the two boundary conditions @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the linear kinetic coefficient , and @xmath35 ( the stefan boundary condition ) determines the solution , @xmath36 ( a simple consequence of heat conservation ) , and @xmath37 . 
 the phase - field equations can be analysed and related to this sharp - interface solution by the method of matched asymptotic expansions in the limit where the interface thickness @xmath5 is much smaller than the diffusion length @xmath38 . 
 this calculation has been presented in detail in refs . 
 @xcite and will not be repeated here . 
 the essential outcome is that , in general , the two asymptotes of the bulk phases do _ not _ correspond to the same temperature . the difference is given , to the lowest order , by @xmath39 , \label{tjump1}\ ] ] where @xmath40 is the equilibrium profile of the phase field . 
 the physical interpretation of this temperature jump is _ trapping _ : when the diffusivity decreases upon solidification , the heat generated at the rear of the interface gets trapped . in the alloy version of the model , 
 this is nothing but the well - known solute trapping effect . indeed , in sharp - interface models of alloy solidification the chemical potential exhibits a jump at the interface when solute trapping occurs . in the phase - field model , 
 the temperature profile through the interface is determined by the interplay between the rejection of latent heat and the diffusion away from the interface ; therefore , it is natural that the heat source function @xmath13 and the diffusivity function @xmath15 appear in eq . 
 ( [ tjump1 ] ) . 
 whereas , thus , this discontinuity is physically correct , it generates problems for simulations . to see this , is is sufficient to rewrite eq . 
 ( [ tjump1 ] ) in order to make the relevant scales apparent . since the only length scale in eq . 
 ( [ pf ] ) is the interface thickness @xmath5 , the equilibrium solution @xmath41 is a function only of the reduced variable @xmath42 . using this together with the interpolation of @xmath15 given by eq . 
 ( [ ddef ] ) , eq . 
 ( [ tjump1 ] ) becomes @xmath43 @xmath44\ ; 
 d\eta\qquad { \rm and } \label{fdef}\ ] ] @xmath45 the temperature jump is thus proportional to the velocity , the interface thickness , and the difference of the two integrals ; the latter depends only on the choice of the interpolation functions . if @xmath5 is the physical interface thickness ( a few angstroms ) , this effect is negligibly small , but if the interface thickness is increased by a large factor to make simulations feasible , this leads to potentially large errors in the simulations .    as discussed in detail in refs . 
 @xcite , it is not possible to eliminate this macroscopic discontinuity simply by the choice of appropriate interpolation functions , due to other constraints not discussed here . 
 the solution put forward in ref . 
 @xcite and further developed in ref . 
 @xcite is the introduction of an antitrapping current : eq . 
 ( [ diffusion ] ) is replaced by @xmath46 where the antitrapping current @xmath47 is given by @xmath48 where @xmath49 is a shorthand for the time derivative @xmath50 , @xmath51 is the unit normal vector to the interface , and @xmath52 is a new interpolation function . 
 this term induces a current which is directed from the solid to the liquid , and proportional to the interface velocity ( through the factor @xmath49 ) . 
 it thus `` pushes '' heat from the solid to the liquid side of the interface when the interface moves , and can be used to adjust the temperature jump at the interface . for the one - sided model ( @xmath53 ) with the standard choices @xmath54 and @xmath55 , it was shown that a constant @xmath56 leads to a vanishing jump in @xmath7 , because it modifies the function @xmath57 in eq . 
 ( [ fdef ] ) such that @xmath58 . 
 thus , continuity of the temperature between the two sides of the interface ( local equilibrium ) is restored for arbitrary @xmath5 and @xmath22 , as long as the asymptotic analysis remains valid . 
 recently , several authors have put forward generalisations of this approach @xcite for arbitrary ratio of the diffusivities . for the case 
 analysed above ( that is , the current far inside the solid vanishes ) , they reduce to the simple prescription that the same expression for the antitrapping current can be used , but with an additional prefactor that can be written as @xmath59 , @xmath60 indeed , the asymptotic analysis shows @xcite that in this way the temperature jump can be eliminated . 
 however , this is not the only thin - interface effect that can arise in the two - sided case . to see this , consider now a different situation , namely an immobile interface in a temperature gradient . 
 such an interface can be easily obtained in experiments by maintaining a pure substance between two walls which are held below and above the melting temperature , respectively . when the interface is stationary , @xmath61 by definition , and eq . 
 ( [ diffusion ] ) implies that the system is crossed by a constant heat current flowing from the liquid into the solid , @xmath62 with @xmath63 a positive constant . as before , 
 the centre of the interface is located at @xmath29 , and the solid is located in the domain @xmath64 . 
 this situation can be analysed without performing a perturbation expansion , since it is sufficient to integrate eq . 
 ( [ current ] ) to obtain a solution for @xmath7 , @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the temperature at @xmath29 . 
 the sharp - interface solution for this case is simply given by @xmath67 matching the asymptotes of the phase - field and sharp - interface expressions , it is straightforward to show that there is again a temperature jump given by @xmath68,\ ] ] this time proportional to the _ 
 current_. if the phase - field profile is replaced by its equilibrium shape , this can be rewritten as @xmath69 with @xmath70    this temperature jump corresponds to a surface thermal resistance , also called kapitza resistance , first found for an interface between liquid helium and metal @xcite . 
 indeed , in a sharp - interface picture it is generally necessary to assign a surface resistance to an interface for a complete description of heat transfer , because transport through an interface can be decomposed into three elementary steps : transport in one bulk phase , crossing of the interface , and transport in the other phase . 
 the surface resistance describes the kinetics associated with the crossing of the interface ( its inverse is sometimes referred to as the interfacial transfer coefficient ) . 
 it is characterised either by the value of the resistance , @xmath71 , or by a length that is obtained by dividing this resistance by the conductivity of the liquid phase . here , this characteristic length is simply @xmath72 , which is of the order of the interface thickness . since 
 this quantity is actually an interface excess of the inverse diffusivity ( in complete analogy to the interface excesses for equilibrium quantities obtained by the well - known gibbs construction ) , it can also be negative  this does not violate the laws of thermodynamics because the _ local _ transport coefficients are strictly positive . 
 if the surface resistance is finite , the temperature in the sharp - interface model is _ not _ continuous at the interface , but exhibits a jump that is proportional to the current crossing the interface . in the alloy version of the model 
 , this corresponds to a jump in chemical potential that is proportional to the solute flux @xcite . 
 such discontinuities have been thoroughly investigated @xcite , and can be measured in experiments @xcite and detected in molecular dynamics simulations @xcite for solid - liquid interfaces . 
 thus , like the trapping effect , the surface resistance is a natural effect that is proportional to the interface thickness . 
 if the interface thickness is to be upscaled , it should therefore also be eliminated . 
 however , is is immediately clear that this effect can not be eliminated by any antitrapping current proportional to @xmath49 as given by eq . 
 ( [ antinew ] ) : since the interface does not move , @xmath73 and the antitrapping current vanishes , independently of the current @xmath63 that crosses the interface . 
 the authors of both refs . 
 @xcite have recognised the importance of the current @xmath63 . 
 they have developed generalised expressions for the antitrapping current with coefficients that depend on the value of @xmath63 . 
 as long as the interface velocity remains non - zero , the formal asymptotic analysis shows that it is still possible to eliminate the temperature jump . 
 however , for a fixed current @xmath63 , the expressions of the coefficients diverge when @xmath22 tends to zero , such that the asymptotic analysis is not valid in this limit . 
 thus , it seems unlikely that this approach can be used as a robust method for simulations .    in summary , there exist two independent thin - interface effects , one proportional to @xmath22 , and one proportional to @xmath63 . on a very fundamental level , this is just the consequence of the fact that the interface motion is driven by a diffusion equation , which has two independent boundary conditions . 
 the corresponding physical quantities are the currents on the two sides of the interface , or one current and the velocity . a general solution to eliminate both thin - interface effects ( which are linearly independent ) does not seem to exist at this moment , but the above considerations can at least be used to obtain simple criteria when the prescription of eq . 
 ( [ antinew ] ) can be used . 
 indeed , eqs . 
 ( [ tjump1a ] ) and ( [ tjump2 ] ) show that if @xmath74 ( note that , since @xmath7 is dimensionless , @xmath63 has the dimension of a velocity ) , the kapitza effect is much smaller than the trapping effect , and can thus be neglected . 
 this is generally the case for equiaxed dendritic growth , in which the gradients outside the growing dendrite , which determine the growth speed , are much larger than the gradients inside the solid . 
 indeed , it was shown in ref .  @xcite that eq . 
 ( [ antinew ] ) works well in this case . 
 however , problems might arise in the case of alloy solidification in a temperature gradient or for multicomponent alloys with widely different solute diffusivities , since in this case large currents of heat or certain solutes may cross an interface whose velocity is controlled by a different diffusion field . 
 such cases have to be critically examined before simulation results can be trusted . 
 the size and shape of the crystalline grains formed upon solidification is one of the most important factors that determine materials properties . 
 therefore , phase - field models that are to be helpful for materials design must be capable of dealing with the evolution of polycrystals , both during solidification of individual columnar or equiaxed grains from the melt and during the subsequent evolution of the grain structure after impingement . 
 this can be achieved using the multi - phase - field approach @xcite , in which each grain is represented by a different phase field , even if they are of the same thermodynamic phase . 
 the properties of each individual grain boundary or interface can then be specified separately @xcite , and it has been demonstrated that good quantitative control of the grain boundary properties can be achieved @xcite . 
 the problem of handling several hundreds or even thousands of phase fields simultaneously can be solved by recognising that only a small number of fields are important at any given point of space ( see for example @xcite ) . 
 an alternative approach is the orientation - field method . 
 its starting point is the remark that it would be desirable , both for efficiency and simplicity , to formulate a model that works only with a small number of field variables . 
 indeed , the orientation of a crystal can be described by one scalar quantity ( an angle ) in two dimensions , and three scalars in three dimension ( for instance , the euler angles ) . 
 orientation - field models for pure substances in two dimensions that work with a single phase field , an orientation field ( the local angle of the crystalline structure with respect to a fixed coordinate system ) , and the temperature field were put forward in refs . 
 @xcite , and generalised for alloy solidification @xcite and to three dimensions @xcite . 
 while these models are elegant and simple in their formulation and therefore hugely appealing , it is pointed out here that the evolution equation of the angle field , which takes the form of a simple relaxation equation , does not correctly describe the microscopic evolution of the orientation field since it does not take into account the connectivity of matter and the resulting geometrical conservation laws .    for simplicity , anisotropy and crystallographic effects 
 will again be neglected , and it is sufficient to consider a two - dimensional system . 
 the dimensionless free energy of the orientation - field model is @xcite @xmath75 d\vec r , \label{modeli}\ ] ] where now @xmath76 and @xmath2 in the liquid and the solid , respectively , @xmath77 and @xmath78 are positive constants , @xmath79 and @xmath80 are monotonous functions that satisfy @xmath81 and @xmath82 , and @xmath83 is the local free energy density , with @xmath7 the same dimensionless temperature field as previously ; the standard choice is @xmath84 . 
 recently , an alternative model was developed @xcite , @xmath85 d\vec r , \label{modelii}\ ] ] where @xmath86 is a constant . in the following 
 , these models will be called model i and model ii . 
 they both have some features that distinguish them from standard phase - field models . 
 model i contains a term proportional to @xmath87 , which has a singular derivative at @xmath88 . 
 model ii has only a regular square gradient term in @xmath89 , but it is multiplied by a singular function of the phase field @xmath1 , which diverges in the limit @xmath90 ( the solid ) . 
 these singular features are needed to create stable grain boundary solutions , that is , localised spatial regions where the phase field departs from its solid value and the angle field exhibits rapid variations . 
 both models have a variational structure for the dynamics of the phase field and the angle field , that is @xmath91 @xmath92 which means that both @xmath1 and @xmath93 evolve such as to follow the gradient of the free energy , with @xmath94 and @xmath95 being the corresponding mobilities ( which may be functions of the fields ) . in the following 
 , it will be shown that eq . 
 ( [ thetaeq ] ) is incorrect for coherent crystalline matter .        to illustrate the problems with this equation of motion , 
 it is again useful to analyse a simple one - dimensional situation , which is a tricrystal . 
 a slab of crystalline orientation @xmath96 is sandwiched between two crystals of identical orientation @xmath97 , as shown in the left side of fig . 
 the two crystals on the sides of the system are assumed to be clamped to a substrate , that is , @xmath97 for all times . in both models 
 , this initial condition evolves with time : the orientation of the central slab remains homogeneous , but changes with time to approach the orientation of the outer crystals . 
 the final state is a uniform solid of orientation @xmath97 : the central slab has disappeared . 
 of course , this process can take place since it corresponds to a minimisation of the free energy : the two grain boundaries with their positive grain boundary energy are eliminated . 
 however , the pathway of this dynamics is not appropriate for the evolution of a coherent crystal . 
 in fact , eq . 
 ( [ thetaeq ] ) corresponds to the dynamics of matter which has orientational , but no positional order , such as a liquid crystal . 
 indeed , if in model i the term proportional to @xmath87 is omitted or in model ii the singular coupling function is replaced by a regular one , the resulting model can be mapped to the standard landau - de gennes model for nematic liquid crystals in two dimensions @xcite . 
 the free energies in eqs . 
 ( [ modeli ] ) and ( [ modelii ] ) have been designed to stabilise grain boundaries , which do not exist in a nematic liquid crystal . 
 the energetics of the models are thus quite different from liquid crystals . in contrast 
 , the type of the dynamics has stayed the same .    to understand where is the difference in dynamics between liquid crystals and crystals , consider the elongated molecules of a nematic liquid crystal characterised by a director field of a certain orientation @xmath96 . since the molecules have no bonds , 
 it is possible to change the local orientation while keeping the centres of mass fixed , by just making each molecule rotate around its centre of mass ( of course , in a dense liquid crystal , this exact procedure is not possible because of steric exclusion , but the director can still be changed with only short - range displacements of the centres of the molecules ) . 
 the system is thus free to _ locally _ change orientation in order to lower its free energy , and thus follows eq . 
 ( [ thetaeq ] ) . 
 this is obviously not the case in crystalline matter : it is not possible to rotate a unit cell without displacing the surrounding neighbours , because bonds ( or , more generally , the positional ordering of elements ) define a connectivity . 
 it is easy to grasp that the evolution depicted in fig.[fig1 ] is impossible if the connectivity of the central slab is preserved . 
 thus , a consistent evolution equation for @xmath93 has to take into account this connectivity , or , in other words , the evolution of the positions . 
 this is , in general , a complicated undertaking . 
 two elementary situations where it easy to obtain an equation are ( i ) rigid body rotation , in which case the ( advected ) time derivative of the local angle is given by the curl of the local velocity field , or ( ii ) purely elastic deformations of the solid , in which case the orientation is not an independent quantity but can be deduced from the elastic displacement field .    here 
 , a third possibility will be briefly discussed , namely , plastic deformation . 
 this corresponds precisely to a change in the connectivity of matter . 
 if the matter in question can be considered reasonably crystalline ( as opposed to , for example , an amorphous material ) , its geometry can formally always be described by a density of dislocations , which are singularities of the displacement field if a perfect crystal is taken as the reference state . 
 if , furthermore , grain boundaries remain coherent ( that is , no grain boundary sliding takes place ) , the evolution of the local orientation can be linked to the motion of dislocations . 
 a complete description is far outside of the scope of this article ; the interested reader is referred to ref . 
 @xcite for a detailed introduction to the continuum theory of defects . here 
 , only two simple examples will be qualitatively treated for illustration . 
 consider again the tricrystal configuration . in the sketch shown in fig . 
 [ fig2 ] , only one set of crystal planes is shown for clarity , and the central slab has a small misorientation with respect to the outer crystals . 
 in this situation , the two low - angle grain boundaries consist of individual edge dislocations . the inner crystal can now rotate by an elementary process : take one of the edge dislocations of the left grain boundary ( marked by a circle ) and make it glide towards the other grain boundary . 
 this process involves only local reconnection events . 
 when the dislocation arrives at the right grain boundary , it can annihilate with a dislocation of the opposite sign . as a result 
 , one dislocation has disappeared from each grain boundary . 
 of course , this process can repeat itself until no dislocation is left , and the grain boundaries have disappeared . 
 it should be stressed that this pathway for rearrangement exhibits large energy barriers , since the elastic energy of a single dislocation is much higher in the centre of the slab than at its original position within the grain boundary . 
 therefore , if only thermal fluctuations are driving this process ( no external strains ) , it will be extremely slow .    on a more quantitative level 
 , the misorientation through a grain boundary is linked to the density of dislocations by simple geometrical arguments . 
 therefore , it is natural that the misorientation is lowered when the dislocation density in the grain boundaries decreases . 
 furthermore , it is obvious that the rotation rate of the central slab is proportional to the current of dislocations crossing the crystal . 
 thus , a consistent equation of motion for the orientation should be based on the evolution of the dislocation density . 
 however , the development of such an equation is a difficult task , because the motion of dislocations is determined by their complicated elastic interactions , as well as by external strain and interactions with other defects . despite intense activity on the phase - field modelling of defects , elasticity , and plasticity ( see @xcite for a recent overview ) , such an equation seems at present out of reach . 
 let us now come back to the outcome of the simulations for the tricrystal configuration . 
 the functional derivative of the gradient term in eq . 
 ( [ modeli ] ) of model i generates a non - local diffusion equation for the angle field , which has to be regularised as described in ref . 
 @xcite . for a constant mobility 
 , the nonlocal interaction between the grain boundaries leads to a rotation rate that is almost independent of the distance between the grain boundaries . in model ii , the rotation rate of the central crystal decreases exponentially with the distance between the grain boundaries @xcite . in both cases , 
 the central slab eventually disappears . 
 while , quantitatively , neither of these evolutions is likely to be accurate , qualitatively the result is the same as the one achieved by dislocation motion . 
 to see that there can be qualitative differences between the two dynamics , consider now a circular grain of orientation @xmath98 inserted in an infinite monocrystal of orientation @xmath97 . 
 suppose that the misorientation ( which is equal to @xmath98 ) is small , such that the grain boundary is made of individual dislocations separated by a typical distance @xmath99 which is much larger than the lattice spacing . 
 furthermore , suppose that the grain radius @xmath100 is large , @xmath101 , such that on the scale of the grain the boundary can still be described as a continuous line . for simplicity , 
 disregard any anisotropy in the grain boundary energy or mobility . 
 then , the grain will shrink by standard motion by curvature , and the dislocations will simply move towards the centre of the grain . 
 note that the motion of the dislocations might not be strictly radial due to their coupling to the crystal structure ; however , this does not change the present discussion , as long as no annihilation of dislocations takes place . indeed , in this case , the total number of dislocations is conserved , and the dislocation density is simply proportional to @xmath102 , which _ increases _ with time as the grain shrinks . 
 this means that the misorientation also increases with time , and if the outer crystal is fixed , the circular inner grain has to perform a rigid body rotation away from the orientation of the outer crystal . 
 this seems surprising at first , since for low - angle grain boundaries the grain boundary energy is an increasing function of the misorientation . 
 however , this process is perfectly possible if it leads to a decrease of the total energy of the grain boundary , which is given by @xmath103 , with @xmath104 the misorientation - dependent grain boundary energy . 
 its time derivative is @xmath105,\ ] ] where @xmath106 is the derivative of @xmath107 with respect to the misorientation . 
 the evolution can thus take place if the first term , which is always negative since @xmath108 , is large enough to outweigh the second one , which is positive . in that case 
 , the geometrical constraints thus predict an increase of @xmath98 with time . 
 the orientation - field models make exactly the opposite prediction : since the angle field evolves _ locally _ such as to lower the energy , the misorientation of the inner grain should _ decrease _ with time . 
 recently , this situation was investigated by numerical simulations @xcite using the phase - field crystal model @xcite , which gives a faithful microscopic picture of dislocations . 
 an increase of the misorientation with time was observed , consistent with the geometrical constraints . 
 a previous study that had compared phase - field and molecular dynamics simulations @xcite and had reached different conclusions was limited to high misorientations , such that the above hypotheses were not satisfied .    in conclusion , the simple relaxation equation for the angle field , eq . 
 ( [ thetaeq ] ) is not consistent with the coherent crystalline structure of matter , and can sometimes lead to predictions that are even qualitatively wrong . for practical purposes , the quantitative importance of the committed errors might be small when the evolution of a large - scale grain structure is considered , but this has to be confirmed for each case at hand . 
 it is worth mentioning that orientation - field models have been used to investigate the interplay between the positional and orientational degrees of freedom during the solidification of spherulites @xcite or in the presence of foreign - phase particles @xcite . 
 these studies were performed with a vanishing orientational mobility @xmath95 in the solid , and are thus not affected by the problem pointed out here . indeed , in the interfacial region where the structure of the solid in not yet fully established , the concept of a rotational mobility is valid . 
 many phase - field simulations include fluctuations , which are often introduced in a purely qualitative way to trigger instabilities or to create some disorder in the geometry of the microstructures . 
 the role of fluctuations has been investigated more quantitatively in connection with the formation of sidebranches in free dendritic growth @xcite . 
 the standard approach is to include fluctuations as langevin terms in the field equations , with coefficients deduced from the fluctuation - dissipation theorem . before proceeding further , 
 this procedure will be summarised . 
 after inclusion of noise , eqs . 
 ( [ pf ] ) and ( [ diffusion ] ) for the solidification of a pure substance become ( see ref . 
 @xcite for details ) @xmath109 @xmath110 where @xmath111 is assumed ( symmetric model ) , and lengths and times have been scaled by the interface thickness @xmath5 and the phase - field relaxation time @xmath4 , respectively . here , @xmath112 and @xmath113 are random fluctuations of the phase field and random microscopic heat currents , respectively . 
 they are assumed to be @xmath114-correlated in space and time , @xmath115 @xmath116 with dimensionless amplitudes @xmath117 and @xmath118 given by @xmath119 @xmath120 where @xmath99 is the spatial dimension , and the quantity @xmath121 is determined by materials properties only , @xmath122 where @xmath123 , @xmath9 , @xmath11 , @xmath10 , and @xmath124 are boltzmann s constant , the melting temperature , the specific heat , the latent heat , and the capillary length , respectively . 
 the latter is given by @xmath125 , where @xmath107 is the surface free energy . 
 with the help of this expression for the capillary length , @xmath121 can be rewritten as @xmath126 , which makes its physical meaning more transparent : it is the ratio of the thermal energy and a capillary energy scale , and can thus be seen as a non - dimensional temperature .    in a finite - difference discretization of timestep @xmath127 and grid spacing @xmath128 , the noise terms are implemented by drawing , at each grid point @xmath129 and for each time step @xmath130 , independent gaussian random variables of correlation @xmath131 where @xmath132 and @xmath133 are now kronecker symbols , and similarly for @xmath134 . 
 this procedure was shown to yield the correct interface fluctuations at equilibrium in numerical simulations @xcite . 
 an obvious question then arises , namely , can this method also be used to explore nucleation ? 
 phase - field methods have been used recently to investigate homogeneous and heterogeneous nucleation , both in single - phase and multi - phase systems ( see , for example , @xcite ) . in particular , it was found that for high undercoolings , diffuse - interface models yield better agreement with experiments than classical nucleation theory , since the size of the nuclei is not much larger than the thickness of the diffuse interfaces ; therefore , the free energy barriers calculated in phase - field models can differ significantly from classical nucleation theory . 
 is it sufficient , then , to add thermal noise as described above to obtain quantitative simulations of nucleation processes ? 
 the answer to this question is negative . 
 the reason is that , for strong noise , field equations like the phase - field model are renormalized by the fluctuations . 
 this is a well - known fact in statistical field theory , but its implications do not yet seem to have been fully appreciated in the phase - field community . 
 therefore , it is useful to briefly sketch a few calculations that can be found in textbooks ( see , for example , @xcite ) . 
 they are , therefore , neither new nor complete ; however , they will prepare the ground for understanding the conclusions on the phase - field method at the end of this section .    instead of the full phase - field model , 
 consider a single equation for a scalar field @xmath1 that reads @xmath135 where @xmath136 is a non - conserved noise that is @xmath114-correlated , @xmath137 with @xmath138 a suitably non - dimensionalized temperature ( such as @xmath121 , see the discussion after eq .  ( [ fexpt ] ) ) , and the deterministic part of the equation derives from the functional @xmath139d\vec r , \label{hamil}\ ] ] where @xmath140 is a local potential of the field @xmath1 ( lengths , times , and energies are dimensionless ) . 
 it is important to stress that @xmath141 is _ not _ a free energy functional , but the hamiltonian of the field theory . 
 ( [ langevin ] ) generates an evolution in which each microscopic field configuration appears with probability @xmath142 in the limit of infinite evolution time . 
 here , @xmath143 is the partition function , @xmath144 and @xmath145 denotes a functional integration over the field @xmath1 . 
 the free energy is then obtained by the standard formula @xmath146 . 
 the free energy can be calculated exactly for the case of a quadratic potential , @xmath147 , where @xmath148 is a constant . to carry out the calculations , 
 it is useful to consider a discrete version of the model . for simplicity , consider as the domain of integration @xmath22 a @xmath99-dimensional torus of size @xmath149 with periodic boundary conditions . 
 when this system is discretized with the usual finite difference formulae using @xmath150 grid points in each direction and hence a grid spacing @xmath151 , the integral in eq . 
 ( [ hamil ] ) becomes a sum over a finite number of variables . in one dimension , @xmath152 , \label{hamilex}\ ] ] with the convention that @xmath153 . 
 for the discretized system , the functional integration in eq . 
 ( [ funcint ] ) is replaced by a simple integration over the field variables at each grid point , @xmath154 since the hamiltonian of eq . 
 ( [ hamilex ] ) is a quadratic form in the @xmath155 s , this is a @xmath150-dimensional gaussian integral which can be evaluated using standard formulae . 
 the most convenient way is to use a discrete fourier transform to find the eigenvalues of the quadratic form . 
 the final result for the free energy is ( up to a constant that can be dropped ) @xmath156 for dimensions @xmath157 , the same calculation can be repeated without difficulties , and the result is @xmath158 where the sum is now over an independent index @xmath159 for each dimension ( @xmath160 ) , and is normally taken over the first brillouin zone , @xmath161 .    for an arbitrary potential @xmath140 , an exact calculation is generally impossible . 
 statistical field theory has developed sophisticated approximation methods , in particular perturbation expansions . 
 formally , every potential can be written as a perturbation of a quadratic potential . the perturbation expansion ( where the expansion parameter is the temperature , which sets the fluctuation strength ) is cumbersome and usually visualised in terms of diagrams @xcite . 
 fortunately , the first order result can be understood in a relatively simple manner if we are interested in homogeneous systems . 
 more precisely , consider the spatial average of the field , @xmath162 which is a fluctuating quantity . 
 the probability distribution of @xmath163 can be written as @xmath164 where @xmath165 is the free energy density . to first order in the perturbation expansion , @xmath166 where the correction to the original ( `` bare '' ) potential @xmath167 is identical to the exact result for the quadratic potential , with the constant @xmath168 replaced by the second derivative of the bare potential , taken at @xmath163 . 
 this results from a quadratic approximation ( second - order taylor expansion ) of the bare potential around @xmath163 . 
 the result @xmath165 is a renormalized potential for @xmath163 .    ) and from numerical simulations , for @xmath169 , @xmath170 , @xmath171 . 
 only the part close to one of the potential wells is shown . 
 the zero of @xmath172 was chosen at the minimum of the renormalized potential . 
 the bin size for the histograms was @xmath173 . ] 
 these calculations can be readily verified numerically . as an example 
 , the standard double - well potential was used , @xmath174 ( usually called @xmath175-potential in the field - theory literature ) , and simulated in a two - dimensional system of size @xmath176 with a grid spacing of @xmath170 and @xmath169 , using the standard discretization method described above with a timestep @xmath177 , and an initial condition @xmath178 . in time intervals of @xmath179 , @xmath163 was calculated , and in total @xmath180 points were sampled . then , the free energy can be obtained by making a histogram of the values of @xmath163 , and taking the logarithm of the counts ( the normalisation contributes only a constant to @xmath172 and can be disregarded ) . 
 the comparison between the simulation and the prediction of eq . 
 ( [ theory ] ) in fig . 
 [ fig3 ] shows excellent agreement . 
 it can be seen that the minimum of the free energy density is shifted with respect to its `` bare '' value @xmath181 . 
 this can be understood intuitively by the following reasoning . 
 the system starts in the well of the `` bare '' potential , at @xmath181 . 
 the random fluctuations push the system in both directions with equal probability , but since the potential is asymmetric , the restoring force is larger for fluctuations towards @xmath182 than towards @xmath183 ; therefore , smaller values are more likely to occur . in the example chosen here , the shift is small ( the minimum is close to @xmath184 ) , but for increasing temperature , the correction becomes larger and larger ( for an example of such simulations , see @xcite ) , and eventually a phase transition occurs ( the double well disappears ) ; in this regime , of course the first - order perturbation result is inaccurate . 
 the correction also depends on the discretization . 
 this is physically sound : a finer discretization introduces more degrees of freedom per unit volume in the discretized system , and hence allows for more fluctuation modes that contribute to the free energy . with a slight change of perspective , 
 this can also be seen as the natural result of a coarse - graining procedure . 
 indeed , if the free energy is calculated from a given microscopic model by coarse - graining ( averaging ) over cells with a certain size @xmath128 larger than the size of the microscopic elements , both the free energy density and the amplitude of the fluctuations that remain after the averaging ( which thus have a wavelength larger than @xmath128 ) depend on the choice of @xmath128 , as was recently demonstrated explicitly for a simple lattice gas model @xcite .    however , a problem arises in the continuum picture : it is easy to verify that , when the grid spacing @xmath128 tends to zero , the sum in eq . 
 ( [ theory ] ) diverges for @xmath185 . 
 this is a classical example of an ultraviolet divergence . 
 thus , eq .  ( [ langevin ] ) has no continuum limit , and if it is written down in continuum language , it is implicitly understood that an ultraviolet cutoff must be specified . 
 a reasonable physical value for a cutoff in condensed - matter systems is the size of an atom . 
 let us now discuss the implications of these facts for phase - field modelling . 
 even though the above calculation have not been carried out for the full model ( @xmath1 and @xmath7 ) , it is clear that renormalization occurs . if a phase - field model is seen as a simulation tool for a problem that is defined in terms of macroscopic parameters , the relevant quantities that need to be adjusted in the model are the renormalized ones . 
 for instance , thermophysical properties are usually interpolated assuming that the phase field takes fixed values in the bulk phases ( @xmath186 ) . if , on average , this is no longer the case , such as in the example of fig . 
 [ fig3 ] , these interpolations become incorrect . 
 an obvious idea to cure this problem is to choose the `` bare '' potential such that the renormalized potential has the desired properties . for the @xmath175-potential , which is renormalizable , one may choose @xmath187 and determine the constants @xmath188 and @xmath189 by the two conditions @xmath190 and @xmath191 using eq . 
 ( [ theory ] ) . 
 for the example shown above , the values @xmath192 and @xmath193 indeed restore the correct bulk properties . 
 however , in a quantitative phase - field model , the macroscopic properties not only of the bulk phases , but also of the interfaces need to be controlled . 
 it is far from obvious that the above procedure , designed for homogeneous systems , will work . 
 this is even more so for the critical nucleus needed to evaluate the nucleation barrier . 
 it is instructive to examine some orders of magnitude . in nickel , 
 the value of @xmath121 is @xmath194 @xcite , of order unity ; it can be expected that this value is of similar order of magnitude for other substances with microscopically rough interfaces . 
 an inspection of eqs . 
 ( [ fnoisedef][fudef ] ) reveals that _ if _ phase - field simulations are carried out with the `` natural '' interface thickness , which is of the order of the capillary length @xmath124 , the fluctuations are of order unity ( recall that @xmath117 and @xmath118 are equivalent to @xmath138 in the numerical example ) , and renormalization can not be neglected . 
 this is a natural consequence of the fact that real solid - liquid interfaces do indeed exhibit very strong fluctuations , as evidenced from molecular dynamics simulations @xcite ; therefore , a mean - field approximation ( such as the phase - field model without noise ) is not accurate . 
 in contrast , if ( as in refs . 
 @xcite ) a much larger interface thickness is used , the fluctuation strength is greatly reduced , and the difference between `` bare '' and renormalized free energy is small . 
 note , however , that even in this limit a sufficient refinement of the grid would create noticeable fluctuation corrections . 
 we are thus faced with the conclusion ( opposite to the usual point of view in phase - field modelling ) that the use of the simple prescription of ref . 
 @xcite is more precise for larger interface thickness and coarser grids . 
 it is noted in passing that the concept of the sharp - interface limit , central for the asymptotic analysis in the deterministic case , has to be reexamined because a new length scale ( the microscopic cutoff for the fluctuations ) has been introduced .    in conclusion 
 , it is clear that the use of the phase - field method with fluctuations is subject to caution , at least on small length scales . to gain a better understanding , the fluctuation effects on the couplings of the phase - field variables need to be investigated 
 furthermore , a good control of the discretization effects needs to be achieved ; the introduction of a simple cutoff will most likely be insufficient , since the renormalized free energy of eq . 
 ( [ theory ] ) also depends on the grid structure . 
 while a large body of results on these topics can certainly be found in the field - theory literature , the development of quantitative models for specific materials remains a challenging task . 
 in this paper , some open questions concerning various aspects of phase - field modelling of solidification have been discussed , and potential future directions of research have been outlined . 
 the selection of topics is necessarily incomplete , both concerning the problems and the potential solutions . 
 for instance , the rapid development of the phase - field crystal approach @xcite and related methods currently opens up interesting new perspectives for the modelling of polycrystals , which are not discussed further here . 
 the common point of the topics treated here is that they illustrate the dual nature of the phase - field method . on the one hand 
 , it is a genuine representation of condensed - matter systems and their evolution in terms of order parameters on a mesoscopic scale . on the other hand , with the help of mathematical analysis , 
 it can be turned into an efficient simulation tool for the solution of free boundary problems . as in the past , the development of more efficient and robust models for materials modelling will most likely benefit from the pursuit and confrontation of _ both _ of these two complementary viewpoints . 
 therefore , the further development of the phase - field method remains an exciting research topic at the frontiers of physics , mathematics , and materials science .

"the effects of weak gravitational lensing by the large - scale structure have been detected in several samples of high redshift qsos , intermediate redshift galaxies , and batse grbs . in the case of point sources , qsos and grbs , 
 weak lensing manifests itself as angular ( anti-)correlations between these sources and foreground inhomogeneously distributed mass @xcite , while in the case of galaxies weak lensing is detected through its coherent shear effect ( see @xcite for a recent review ) . in principle 
 , there is another , more direct way of detecting weak lensing , which uses fluxes of standard candles . 
 if the observed magnitudes of standard candles are corrected for cosmological distances then the effect of lensing can be seen : brighter sources will lie behind regions of mass density excess , while fainter ones will have mass deficits in their foregrounds . 
 the best example of cosmological standard candle , supernovae type ia ( snia ) have been extensively observed with the purpose of determining the global geometry of the universe @xcite . 
 nuisance effects like evolution , variations in individual sn , and gray dust extinction have been studied theoretically and observationally , and have either been corrected for or shown to be small . 
 weak lensing , another nuisance effect has been addressed theoretically by several authors @xcite and found to be unimportant given the current uncertainties . 
 for example ,  @xcite used ray tracing through cosmological simulations and found that the lensing induced dispersions on truly standard candles are @xmath3 and @xmath4 mag at redshift @xmath5 and @xmath6 , respectively , in a cobe - normalized cold dark matter universe with @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9km / s / mpc and @xmath10 . 
 these are small variations compared to the current errors which are @xmath11 mag . 
 even though weak lensing effects are estimated to be small for @xmath12 , they are predicted to be non - negligible for higher redshift sources , so it is not surprising that the highest redshift snia , sn1997ff at @xmath13 has been examined by several authors @xcite for the effects of weak lensing due to galaxies along the line of sight . 
 present day high-@xmath0 snia samples are dominated by lower redshift sne , and so have not been examined for the effects of lensing . 
 the main goal of this work is to determine if the observed fluxes of the cosmologically distant snia have suffered significantly from lensing induced ( de- ) amplifications . 
 the largest homogeneous compilation of snia has been recently published by  @xcite : table 15 of that paper contains 74 sne at @xmath14 . 
 the authors use four different light curve fitting methods ( mlcs , @xmath15 , modified dm15 , and bayesian adapted template match ) to estimate distances to sne . 
 the final quoted distance is the median of the estimates of the four individual methods , and the uncertainty is the median of the error of the contributing methods . 
 the analysis presented in @xcite yields values of the global cosmological parameters ; if a flat model is assumed , then @xmath16 and @xmath17 . 
 we use these values in all the analysis of the present paper .    as tracers of foreground mass density we use apm galaxies @xcite . 
 apm provides near full coverage of the sky in the northern and southern hemispheres , at @xmath18 . in our analysis 
 we use only the central @xmath19 of apm plates . since the plate centres are separated by @xmath20 , 
 there exist small portions of the sky that are not covered by any plate . as 
 a result of these cuts , only 55 of the 74 sne lie on the usable parts of apm plates . 
 the median redshift of the 55 sne is @xmath21 . 
 is not in our sample : it fell in the cracks between the apm plates . ] 
 since most of the sne have rather low redshifts , care must be taken to ensure that galaxies are foreground to the sne . furthermore , because sne span a large range of nearby redshifts , from @xmath22 to @xmath23 , the optimal lens redshift @xmath24 will depend on @xmath25 much more compared to a typical case where sources ( say , qsos ) are at @xmath26 and so the redshift of optimal lenses is roughly independent of @xmath25 . in our analysis 
 we adjust @xmath24 for each sn source by selecting the appropriate limiting apparent magnitude , mag@xmath27 for apm galaxies on red plates . 
 @xcite gives an empirical expression for the median redshift @xmath28 of a galaxy sample with a given faint magnitude flux cutoff . 
 this median redshift can be equated with the optimal lens redshift @xmath24 , and hence the magnitude limit of the foreground galaxies can be determined for every sn separately . however , there is a small catch . for @xmath29 optimal @xmath30 . 
 the galaxy redshift distribution whose median redshift @xmath31 has a considerable tail extending beyond @xmath32 . to avoid the problem of source / lens redshift overlap we use @xmath33 , where factor of 2 was chosen arbitrarily . 
 we explore the dependence of the results on this factor in section  [ robust ] . 
 around every sn we draw a circle of radius @xmath34 , and count the number of galaxies , @xmath35 , in the appropriate magnitude range . 
 this number is compared to the average number density in control circles , @xmath36 . 
 fractional galaxy excess is @xmath37 . 
 control circles are confined to the same apm plate as the sn , and to the same distance from the plate centre as the sn ( to reduce the effects of vignetting ) ; however , scattering the control circles randomly on the plate does not change the results significantly . for each 
 sn we also calculate @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is the number of control circles , out of total @xmath40 , that have less galaxies in them than the circle around the sn . 
 in other words , @xmath38 is the rank of the sn circle among its control ` peers ' . if sne are randomly distributed with respect to the foreground galaxies , then average @xmath41 . 
 if sne have an excess ( deficit ) of galaxies in front of them then their @xmath42 will be greater ( less ) than 0.5 . 
 analogous to the medians being more stable than averages , @xmath38 rank statistic is more stable than @xmath43 .    , and @xmath17 , and extinction , k - corrected distances from @xcite . 
 @xmath44 is a measure of the number density of foreground galaxies in circles of radius @xmath34 around sne ( see section  [ anal ] for details ) . 
 there are a total of 55 sources ( with magnitude errors ) , but only 50 ( filled points ) are used in the analysis . 
 the 50 points are grouped into three bins , whose horizontal size is shown as thick horizontal `` error - bars '' . 
 the corresponding vertical error - bars show the deviation of the mean of the points in each bin ( the rms is 4 times larger ) , and the intersection of the thick lines are the averages of the mag@xmath45 of sne in each bin . 
 the thin slanting line is the best - fit to 50 sne , and has a slope @xmath46 . 
 the significance of the correlation is @xmath2.,width=317 ]    figure  [ figone ] shows absolute magnitudes , @xmath47 , and @xmath38 ranks of 55 sne found on apm plates . 
 the effect of flux dimming due to cosmological distances has been taken out , i.e. all the sne have been ` brought ' to the same redshift ; the constant magnitude offset on the vertical axis is irrelevant for this work . 
 there are two sne whose magnitudes make them @xmath48 outliers , sn1997o , and sn1997bd represented by empty circles with dotted line error - bars . 
 we exclude these from our analysis . as quoted in @xcite . 
 sn1997o and sn1994h were excluded from the primary fit ( fit c ) by the analysis of @xcite . 
 we do not exclude sn1994h from our analysis , but if we did it would improve the trend , as its coordinates on fig . 
 [ figone ] are ( 0.427 ; -0.606 ) . ]    . 
 distance errors , @xmath49 were derived by @xcite , and listed in column 9 of their table 15 . the solid histogram is for 55 sn ; the dashed line represents 31 sn from the high-@xmath0 supernova search team . 
 the 3 outlier sne with @xmath50 are not used in the present analysis.,width=317 ]    the distance ( or , magnitude ) errors , as estimated by @xcite for the 55 sne are shown in fig . 
 [ figthree ] , as the solid line histogram . 
 the dashed line represents the subsample of 31 sne from high-@xmath0 supernova search team @xcite , whose errors appear to be generally smaller than those of the supernova cosmology project @xcite . 
 we use sne from both the groups , but exclude three outliers in fig . 
 [ figthree ] , whose @xmath51 . in fig . 
 [ figone ] these are represented by empty circles with dashed line error - bars . 
 thus , we exclude a total of 5 sne from our analysis , leaving us with 50 , shown as the solid points in fig . 
 [ figone ] . 
 these 50 sne exhibit a relation between their @xmath47 and @xmath38 , in the sense that brighter sne have an excess of galaxies in their foregrounds . for illustration purpose 
 only , we bin the 50 sne into three bins ; fig . 
 [ figone ] shows the extent of the bins and the deviation of the mean of the sne magnitudes in each bin as thick lines .    the best - fit line to the 50 sne in fig . 
 [ figone ] has a slope @xmath46 , and is shown as a thin slanting line . 
 this fit does not include magnitude errors . 
 to include the errors we do the following . 
 we calculate the best - fit slope for 10,000 realizations of the data , where each data point s sn magnitude is replaced by a randomly picked magnitude from a gaussian distribution centred on the actual magnitude value , and having width equal to the quoted error . 
 this procedure correctly incorporates the information contained in the errors , and produces a distribution of best - fit slopes , which is shown as a solid line histogram in fig . 
 [ figextra ] . 
 this distribution shows that the median best - fit slope is @xmath52 , while @xmath53 ( i.e. a case of no correlation ) is ruled out at 99.80% confidence level . 
 had we used 53 sne ( i.e. had we not exluded the 3 sne with large distance errors ) , the median best - fit slope would gave been @xmath54 , while @xmath53 would have been ruled out at 99.37% confidence level . 
 the corresponding distribution of @xmath55 slopes is shown as the dashed line in fig . 
 [ figextra ] .    ? 
 the histograms show the distribution of derived @xmath55 values in 10,000 realizations of the data . 
 the solid ( dashed ) line histogram represents results using 50 ( 53 ) sne . 
 the short vertical lines at the bottom of the plot indicate the medians of the distributions.,width=317 ]    next , we determine the likelihood of this relation arising by chance . to that end 
 , we estimate the significance of the relation in two ways . 
 first , we assign random positions to sne ( keeping these control sne on the same apm plate as the original source ) , and redo all the analysis . 
 we repeat this 1000 times , and in 8 cases we find @xmath56 , implying statistical significance of @xmath57 . 
 second , we take the list of observed @xmath47 values and randomly reassign them to observed sn sky positions . 
 10,000 randomized sne samples are created in this fashion , and only @xmath58 of these have @xmath59 . 
 based on these two tests we conclude that the significance of the @xmath47@xmath38 relation is better than @xmath60 . 
 these results are consistent with weak gravitational lensing , which would amplify sne found behind more nearby mass concentrations , as traced by apm galaxies . 
 alternatively , the results could be due to the action of galactic dust , which will obscure certain directions of the sky making galaxies less numerous and sne fainter . 
 we consider galactic dust further in section  [ disc ] ; in sections  [ model ] and  [ montecarlo ] we proceed on the assumption that weak lensing is responsible to the @xmath47@xmath38 relation . 
 the distribution of sne points in fig .  [ figone ] depends on specific choices that we made for certain parameters , in particular we chose circles of radius @xmath34 and galaxy magnitude limit such that @xmath61 , where @xmath62 ( see section  [ data ] ) . 
 how would the results change if different choices were made ? 
 in other words , how robust is our result , would it disappear had we picked a different set of parameters ?     of circles around sne . 
 the vertical axis shows @xmath55 , the slope of the best - fit line to the relation of the type shown in fig  [ figone ] . 
 the filled circles represent cases where galaxies were counted around sn ; stars symbols represent cases where galactic stars were used instead ( i.e. control experiment ) . 
 the dotted lines denote , _ approximately _ , the levels of statistical confidence . 
 the dashed vertical line indicates radius @xmath63 used in the analysis of section  [ anal].,width=317 ]    figure  [ figthetatest ] shows the effect of changing @xmath63 . 
 the vertical axis is @xmath55 , the best - fit to the @xmath47@xmath38 relation in each case . 
 filled points represent cases where _ galaxies _ were counted and used to determine the @xmath38 rank , while star symbols represent cases where _ galactic stars _ were used instead . 
 as expected , @xmath64 do not correlate with sne magnitudes , and the values of the best - fit slopes are near zero . 
 however , because the apm star - galaxy classifier is not perfect , some ` stars ' are actually galaxies , which accounts for some signal being seen when using @xmath64 . 
 horizontal dotted lines mark the approximate location of @xmath65 , and @xmath60 confidence levels . 
 these are only approximate because every point in the plot will have its own significance level , but because the number of sne contributing to each point is the same in each case , and the total dispersion in sne magnitudes is the same , same @xmath55 values have about the same significance , regardless of @xmath63 . 
 we note that for very small @xmath63 the galaxy numbers become very small , and poisson noise drowns out any @xmath47@xmath38 correlation that might exist , so the upturn in the values of the best - fit slope at small @xmath63 is probably not real . 
 the dashed vertical line marks the @xmath63 value used in section  [ anal ] . 
 we conclude that significant @xmath47@xmath38 anti - correlations occur only with galaxies and not with galactic stars ( which serve as a control sample ) , and only for @xmath66 .    . 
 similar to fig . 
 [ figthetatest ] ; see section  [ robust ] for details.,width=317 ]    figure  [ figmagtest ] shows the effect of changing the median redshift , @xmath61 of the apm galaxies , or equivalently , mag@xmath27 . 
 the hidden variable which is varied along the horizontal axis is @xmath67 . 
 since each sn has a different value of @xmath24 and hence mag@xmath27 , depending on its @xmath25 , there is no unique way of labeling the horizontal axis by using galaxy magnitudes , or redshifts . 
 we label that axis by assuming @xmath68 , the median of the sne redshift distribution . at the top of the plot 
 we show how galaxy magnitude limit on the horizontal axis translates into the median galaxy redshift ( for a specific case of @xmath68 ) . 
 we see that significant anti - correlation between @xmath47 and @xmath38 of foreground galaxies occurs for galaxies with @xmath69 . using galactic stars instead of galaxies 
 produces no significant results . 
 the value we used in section  [ anal ] is shown with a vertical dashed line , and corresponds to @xmath70 . as in fig . 
 [ figthetatest ] the upturn in the best - fit slope values at bright mag@xmath27 is probably due to poisson noise . the range of redshifts of apm galaxies that act as the best lenses for sne are @xmath71 ; more distant galaxies show no signal , as expected , if lensing is the correct interpretation of the data , because more distant galaxies are either too close to sne in redshift or are actually at the same @xmath0 . 
 a number of other tests have been carried out as well . 
 for example , instead of using a @xmath25-dependent mag@xmath27 , we tried fixed values of @xmath72 , which gave , @xmath73 , respectively , comparable to , but somewhat smaller than those seen in fig . 
 [ figmagtest ] . 
 this is not surprising : @xmath25-dependent galaxy magnitude limits pick optimal lens redshifts for each source , thus maximizing the observed lensing signature . 
 we also reran the analysis with subsamples of the entire 50-source sample . 
 we split the sne according to the teams : 20 supernova cosmology project snia gave a @xmath47@xmath38 anti - correlation significant at 95.8% , while the corresponding significance level for the 30 sne from the high-@xmath0 supernova search team is 96% . because the quality of ukst apm ( southern hemisphere ) plates is higher than poss apm ( northern hemisphere ) plates , and because there is some overlap between plates along the equator , we used ukst plates whenever possible . redoing the analysis using only the 36 ukst sne we get the best fit slope @xmath74 at a significance level of 99.6% , 
 while the 14 poss sne had @xmath75 and the correlation was not significant , which is not surprising given the size of this subsample . splitting the whole sample into low and high redshift groups we get the following results : 25 sne with @xmath76 
 have a slope @xmath77 at 96.8% , while 25 sne with with @xmath78 have a slope @xmath79 at 88.9% . 
 these tests suggest that the @xmath47@xmath38 relation has a physical origin ( weak lensing or galactic dust ) , and is not an artifact arising form one subset of the data . 
 in this section we adopt the weak lensing interpretation of the @xmath47@xmath38 relation . 
 our simple lensing model does not use the individual values of @xmath25 , and the optimal redshift distribution of the corresponding lenses . in lieu of these parameters 
 we use the lensing optical depth of the matter traced by the galaxies , @xmath80 . for a fixed global geometry 
 , @xmath80 depends on @xmath25 and the redshift distribution of the mass traced by the galaxies . 
 we assume that the apm galaxies faithfully trace the mass up to some redshift , @xmath81 , then @xmath82^{1/2}\ ; \sigma_{crit}(z , z_s ) } }           \ ; dz,\end{aligned}\ ] ] in that case , projected fractional mass excess is @xmath83 , where @xmath84 is the convergence , with respect to a smooth universe ( filled beam ) for the corresponding line of sight . in the weak lensing regime source amplification @xmath85 ; @xmath86 for an unlensed source . the smallest value that @xmath84 can attain is minus the total optical depth , @xmath87 , which corresponds to emptying out all the mass along the line of sight from the observer to @xmath81 .    in addition to the value for @xmath80 , our model has three ingredients , ( 1 ) mass distribution , i.e. a probability distribution ( pdf ) for @xmath88 , which is related to @xmath84 pdf , ( 2 ) a biasing scheme , which relates @xmath88 to the projected fractional galaxy number density excess , @xmath43 , and ( 3 ) the dispersion in the intrinsic magnitudes of snia s . 
 given this information we generate synthetic snia samples , with 50 sources each , then compute @xmath38 each sn , and the observed sn magnitude , @xmath47 . 
 the slope of the best - fit line to the @xmath47@xmath38 relation , @xmath55 is then used to test how well a given model reproduces the observations .    because our model assumes the same @xmath24 distribution for all sources , the value of @xmath55 to compare our models predictions to should be the one obtained by using a constant mag@xmath89 , i.e. @xmath90 ( see fourth paragraph in section  [ robust ] ) . 
 the specifics of the three model ingredients , and the associated model parameters are described later in this section . 
 the goal of the modeling is to determine what set of parameters can reproduce the observations , i.e. have @xmath91 . 
 we are particularly interested in what effect biasing has on the results . 
 it is often suggested that the large amplitude of qso - galaxy correlations mentioned in the introduction is , at least in part , due to the fact that biasing is not a simple linear , one - to - one mapping from @xmath88 to @xmath43 . 
 qso - galaxy correlation function ( @xmath92 ) , galaxy autocorrelation ( @xmath93 ) and the matter fluctuation power spectrum ( @xmath94 ) are related by @xmath95 where @xmath96 is the biasing parameter . 
 this means that @xmath92 probes a _ combination _ of @xmath96 and @xmath94 . 
 thus , for a given @xmath94 , @xmath92 can be enhanced with positive biasing , especially if it is non - linear on relevant spatial scales . 
 the important difference between weak lensing induced qso - galaxy correlations and the effect on standard candles we have studied here is that in the latter case biasing plays a minor role . 
 the slope of the @xmath47@xmath38 relation is most sensitive to the mass distribution . 
 our modeling demonstrates this later ; first , we described the specifics of the three model ingredients . 
 based on the results from cosmological n - body simulations @xcite the shape of the probability distribution function ( pdf ) of @xmath84 is very roughly gaussian , but asymmetric , with the most probable @xmath84 , which we call @xmath97 being less than 0 , i.e. most sources are deamplified . 
 the tail of the @xmath84 distribution extends to high positive values of @xmath84 . 
 we use these published results of @xcite to construct an approximate shape for our @xmath84 pdf : @xmath98 ^ 2/2\sigma_{\kappa_1 } ) , \quad { \rm for}\quad \kappa > \kappa_m\\ exp\;(-[\kappa-\kappa_m]^2/2\sigma_{\kappa_2 } ) , \quad { \rm for}\quad \kappa\le\kappa_m \end{array } \right . 
 \label{stdpdf}\ ] ] the pdf is a combination of two half - gaussians , with two widths , @xmath99 and @xmath100 , which describe the high @xmath84 and the low @xmath84 sides of the pdf respectively . 
 the location of the peak of the pdf , @xmath97 is adjusted such that the average @xmath84 is 0 , which implies @xmath101 @xmath97 is always negative , since the skewness of the pdf dictates that @xmath102 . from the numerically computed pdfs of @xcite we estimate that for a flat @xmath103 model , where the sources are at @xmath104 , and the smoothing scale is @xmath105 , the following approximations apply : @xmath106 , and @xmath107 . 
 thus we now have a realistic @xmath84 pdf , appropriate for a standard cosmology with standard mass distribution . 
 figure  [ grid](d ) shows such a pdf as a short - dash line . 
 in addition to the standard @xmath84 pdf described above , we also try an extreme form for @xmath84 pdf obtained using the `` bifocal lens '' mass distribution proposed by @xcite : @xmath108 where @xmath109 is the kronicker s delta function , @xmath110 , and @xmath111 . for a fixed @xmath80 , 
 this pdf can produce more pronounced lensing effects than the standard pdf , if @xmath112 is assigned the smallest allowable value , and @xmath113 is made very large . 
 this is because the standard pdf has a large probability near @xmath86 , while the bifocal pdf avoids such values altogether .    the distribution of mass corresponding to eq . 
 [ bifocals ] is unrealistic . 
 one can make it somewhat realistic by allowing a range of @xmath113 and @xmath112 values . 
 we do the following : for any one line of sight we randomly pick @xmath113 and @xmath112 from specified ranges , using flat priors , and eq . 
 [ bifocals ] sets the probability distribution of the two amplifications . 
 we use two sets of ranges : ( 1 ) @xmath114 and @xmath115 ( we will call this model bifocal i model ) , ( 2 ) @xmath116 and @xmath117 ( we will call this bifocal ii ) . the corresponding @xmath84 pdfs , obtained by considering many lines of sight are shown in fig . 
 [ grid](d ) as a solid line for bifocal ii and as a long - dash line for bifocal i. in bifocal ii the minimum value of @xmath112 is the minimum allowed value ; the other limits on @xmath118 s were picked arbitrarily . for comparison , 
 the standard @xmath84 pdf of section  [ stdmass ] is also shown , as the short - dash line . 
 optical depth of @xmath119 was assumed for all three . 
 compared to a standard pdf , bifocal pdfs imply that most of the lines of sight are rather empty , and there are a few lines of sight with very high values of @xmath84 . 
 projected fractional mass excess , @xmath88 is related to the observationally accessible quantity , @xmath43 through biasing . 
 we chose `` power law '' biasing , motivated by numerical simulations of @xcite and @xcite , @xmath120 where the power law part allows the biasing to be non - linear , with different indexes depending on the sign of @xmath88 , while @xmath121 is a stochastic biasing component which is chosen randomly for each sn ; @xmath121 distribution has a gaussian shape and width @xmath122 . 
 factor @xmath123 multiplying @xmath121 ensures that the dispersion in @xmath43 is reduced in underdense regions . 
 qualitatively , the @xmath43 vs. @xmath88 relations produced by eq . 
 [ biasing ] look similar to those in fig.1 of @xcite . 
 we assume that the dispersion in magnitude about the perfect standard candle case has a gaussian shape , with width @xmath124 . 
 each model has five independent parameters : + @xmath125 . we assume flat priors for the three biasing parameters , @xmath126 , @xmath127 , and @xmath122 , as well as for @xmath124 . 
 each specific set of parameters together with one of the three mass distribution models generates a synthetic realization of the 50-source snia sample . from this entire ensemble of realizations , we only consider those that satisfy these observational constraints : ( 1 ) the total rms dispersion in the synthetic snia magnitudes ( which includes intrinsic and lensing induced contributions ) must be within 0.05 mag of the actual observed value of 0.3mag ; ( 2 ) the moments of the synthetic @xmath43 distribution ( average , standard deviation , skewness and kurtosis ) must be reasonably close to those of the observed distribution , which is characterized by ( 0.063 , 0.52 , 1.7 , 4.9 ) . 
 we chose `` reasonably close '' to mean that synthetic values must not be more than a factor of 2 away from the actual values . because of these constraints , the range from which the values of @xmath126 , @xmath127 , @xmath122 , and @xmath124 parameters are picked is not relevant , as long as it not too restrictive . 
 in other words , the observational constraints eliminate cases with very large values of these parameters . 
 the data suggests that demagnified sne are not lost due to the flux limit . if they were , we would have less sne at small values of @xmath38 , and more at high values of @xmath38 , whereas in the data ( fig .  [ figone ] ) 
 the sources are roughly equally spread over the entire @xmath38 range . 
 so our synthetic lensing models assume that we do not lose sne because of deamplification .     of the @xmath47 vs. @xmath44 relation ) given different mass distribution models , and a range of optical depths . 
 solid dots assume standard @xmath84 pdf of section  [ stdmass ] , empty squares and star symbols represent bifocal i and ii models , respectively , discussed in section  [ bifocalmass ] . 
 each point was obtained using 10,000 synthetic realizations of snia 50-source sample . 
 see section  [ montecarlo ] for details.,width=317 ]    for each synthetic realization of the 50-source snia sample we derive the corresponding @xmath47@xmath38 relation . the slope of the best - fit line , @xmath55 is recorded . for a given value of @xmath80 
 we generate 10,000 realizations . 
 solid dots in fig . 
 [ figoptdepth ] show the percentage of realizations that have @xmath55 smaller than the observed value of -0.3 , as a function of total optical depth , for the standard @xmath84 pdf . 
 empty squares and star symbols represent the results for the bifocal i and ii . 
 figure  [ figoptdepth ] considers a range of optical depths . 
 what is the appropriate value for @xmath80 ? 
 if the source is at the median source redshift for our sample , @xmath68 , then apm galaxies sample the mass distribution up to a redshift of about 0.3 . in this case 
 the lensing optical depth probed by apm galaxies is 0.011 ( left - most arrow in fig . 
 [ figoptdepth ] ) . a somewhat more optimistic estimate for @xmath80 
 is obtained if we assume that galaxies trace the mass fluctuations up to the median source redshift , 0.47 , which gives @xmath128 ( middle arrow ) . 
 the limiting case is obtained by considering the most distant source , at @xmath129 , and assuming that galaxies probe mass up to a redshift of 0.47 , which gives @xmath130 ( right - most arrow ) .    the important conclusion from this figure is that if the standard mass distribution ( section  [ stdmass ] ) is assumed , then the value of @xmath80 does not really matter , and the probability of reproducing the observations is @xmath131 , if @xmath80 is within a reasonable range . if , on the other hand , the bifocal pdf i or ii are assumed , the probability of reproducing observations depends sensitively on the assumed optical depth . if @xmath130 then these models yield 6 - 20% probability . 
 the bifocal pdfs produce more discernible lensing effects , for the same @xmath80 because they have a wider range in @xmath118 , as seen in fig . 
 [ grid](d ) .    @xmath44 relation on the three biasing parameters ( see section  [ biasscheme ] ) . 
 short - dash lines are for the standard @xmath84 pdf model of section  [ stdmass ] , while the solid lines are for the bifocal ii @xmath84 pdf described in section  [ bifocalmass ] . 
 both models assume optical depth @xmath132 . 
 the contours are based on 50,000 realizations , and are spaced a factor of 3 apart . 
 the shapes of the contours are partly determined by the observational constraints , described in section  [ montecarlo ] ( second paragraph ) . 
 it is evident that biasing parameters have little impact on the @xmath55 . 
 _ panel ( d ) : _   short - dash and solid lines represent @xmath84 pdfs corresponding to the contours in panels ( a)-(c ) of the same line type . 
 the minimum @xmath84 in the bifocal ii pdf is @xmath87 ( indicated by an arrow ) . 
 the long - dash line represents bifocal i @xmath84 pdf . 
 , width=317 ]    the results presented in fig . 
 [ figoptdepth ] marginalize over values of all the model parameters ( except @xmath80 ) , so the effects of the biasing parameters on @xmath55 are hidden . 
 however , it turns out that these parameters do not correlate with @xmath55 . 
 figure  [ grid ] shows the dependence of @xmath55 on @xmath126 , @xmath127 and @xmath121 for the bifocal ii @xmath84 pdf model ( solid contour lines ) , and the standard @xmath84 pdf model ( dashed contour lines ) , both for @xmath132 . 
 fifty thousand realizations were created for each model , and the corresponding contour lines plotted , with adjacent contours separated by a factor of 3 . 
 it is apparent that for both models the dependence on the biasing parameters is weak . 
 we conclude that _ the slope of the @xmath47@xmath44 relation depends on the amount and distribution of matter , i.e. on @xmath80 and the shape of the @xmath84 pdf model , but does not depend on the specifics of the biasing scheme . 
 _ figure  [ figoptdepth ] quantifies the dependence on amount and distribution of mass : as expected , higher optical depth results in more pronounced lensing effects . 
 standard @xmath84 pdf produces less lensing for the same @xmath80 compared to a much broader bifocal pdf . 
 figure  [ grid ] demonstrates that biasing has little effect on the slope of @xmath47@xmath44 relation . in other words , the type of lensing signature considered here ( @xmath47@xmath44 relation for standard candles ) probes mass distribution , and is independent of biasing . 
 we detect the signature of weak lensing in the current sample of 50 high redshift snia taken from two teams : high-@xmath0 supernova search team and supernova cosmology project . after correcting sne magnitudes for cosmological distances ( assuming @xcite values ) 
 , we find that brighter sne are preferentially found behind regions overdense in foreground galaxies . 
 this @xmath47@xmath44 relation has a slope @xmath133 to @xmath134 , when the angular radii of foreground regions are 5 - 15 arcmin . 
 the statistical significance is @xmath2 ( see fig .  [ figthetatest ] and  [ figmagtest ] ) . 
 the angular radii of 5 - 15 arcmin imply that the lensing structures are @xmath135 mpc across if they are located at a redshift of 0.1 , and so correspond to non - linearly evolved intermediate - scale structure .    aside from the possibility that the observed @xmath47@xmath44 relation is a fluke , 
 there is one other possible , non - lensing interpretation : galactic dust obscuration , which would make snia sources brighter and apm galaxies more numerous in the directions devoid of galactic dust . 
 if this interpretation is correct , then ( 1 ) galactic extinction corrections applied to the sne @xcite are much too small , and ( 2 ) galactic dust is able to change projected apm galaxy number density by @xmath136 , since the observed rms in @xmath43 is @xmath137 . 
 we can not comment on ( 1 ) , but can estimate the effect of ( 2 ) . 
 how much excess / deficit in galaxy density can galactic dust create ? using @xcite data we calculate the average @xmath138 galactic extinction for the 50 sne sample to be 0.18 mag . 
 the slope of the r - band apm galaxy number counts is @xmath139 , therefore typical `` dust - induced '' @xmath140 . 
 this is an upper bound because extinction in the @xmath141 band will be smaller than in @xmath138 , and because extinction averaged over 5 - 15 arcmin radius patches will be smaller than estimates for individual sne , given that @xcite extinction map resolution is 6@xmath142.1 fwhm . if galactic dust is indeed the cause of the @xmath47@xmath44 correlation , then @xmath47 and @xmath44 should separately correlate with sne extinction . in reality 
 , @xcite extinction estimates do not show a correlation with either @xmath47 or @xmath44 . 
 overall , galactic dust interpretation of the observed @xmath47@xmath44 relation seems unlikely , but can not be ruled out .    note that dust _ 
 intrinsic _ to the @xmath143 structures probed by the apm galaxies can not be invoked to explain the observations , because such dust would produce an effect opposite to the one detected here , i.e. @xmath55 would be positive . 
 if dust is present in groups and clusters traced by the apm , it will diminish the amplitude of the effect we detect . 
 presence of dust in groups was suggested by @xcite who found that faint qso candidates are anti - correlated with foreground groups . 
 however , such an anti - correlation can also be explained by weak lensing @xcite . 
 current observations indicate that groups and clusters do not contain significant amounts of dust @xcite . 
 if the lensing interpretation in correct , then the standard models of mass distribution have some difficulty in reproducing @xmath55 ; the observed value would be detected only in @xmath131 of the cases . 
 we investigate how @xmath55 is affected by the amount and distribution of mass along the light of sight to the sources , and galaxy biasing schemes . 
 we find that larger optical depths and broader @xmath84 pdf result in steeper @xmath55 slopes ( fig . 
 [ figoptdepth ] ) . 
 optical depth is a function of global geometry , and no realistic cosmological model can give @xmath144 , which is what would be required to comfortably explain the results . 
 broader @xmath84 pdfs mean that mass fluctuations are more extreme than the standard cosmological models allow , a scenario which is in apparant conflict with other means of determining mass fluctuations , like cosmic velocity flows and weak shear lensing . 
 we also find that biasing has little effect on @xmath55 ( fig . 
 [ grid ] ) . 
 this insensitivity to biasing is in contrast to weak lensing induced qso - galaxy and grb - galaxy ( anti-)correlations , where biasing could , at least partly explain the higher than expected amplitude of the effect @xcite . 
 we conclude that weak lensing of standard candles provides a cleaner probe of the mass distribution at @xmath145 , on @xmath146few mpc scales , then lensing induced angular correlations . 
 in fact , snia can provide the perfect means of measuring mass inhomogeneities using gravitational lensing . 
 a set of standard candles at known redshifts can be analyzed using the complementary techniques of weak magnification and weak shear lensing . 
 the advantage of magnification lensing over the more commonly used shear lensing is that with the former one can chose the redshift range of the lenses , whereas the latter yields the cumulative effect of lensing along the entire line of sight to the source . 
 therefore a large uniform set of intermediate redshift snia , such as the ones that would result from the snap mission and the lsst missionhome.html ] would be invaluable for the studies of mass clustering in the nearby universe . 
 in addition to detecting intermediate and high - redshift sne for the purposes of estimating the global cosmological parameters and the equation of state of the dark energy , snap will also measure weak shear lensing signature due to large scale structure . combining magnification data ( of the type considered in this paper ) and shear information @xcite for 
 a large set of sne will allow the study of mass distribution at @xmath147 with unprecedented accuracy and 3-dimensional spatial resolution . 
 the final issue we address is the impact of weak lensing on the determination of global cosmological parameters , @xmath148 and @xmath149 using snia standard candles . in principle 
 , weak lensing can affect the derived values of @xmath148 and @xmath149 , if ( 1 ) demagnified sne are preferentially lost from the sample due to faint flux cutoff , and/or ( 2 ) the @xmath84 pdf is asymmetric and the sn sample size is small ( see also @xcite ) . 
 if demagnified sne were lost from the sample then the distribution of sne in @xmath44 would be skewed in the direction of larger @xmath44 values . 
 if @xmath84 pdf is asymmetric , ( and it is , on scales considered here ) , then most sne in a small sample will be slightly demagnified compared to average , and will have their @xmath44 skewed in the direction of smaller values . 
 so both ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) would make the distribution of sne in @xmath44 uneven , and would to some extent cancel each other . in the present sample of 50 
 , the distribution of sne in @xmath44 is indistinguishable from uniform , so the average @xmath47 corresponds to the average @xmath44 , and hence lensing effects by @xmath146mpc - size structures probably did not bias the derived values of @xmath148 and @xmath149 .

 this is consistent with the interpretation that sne fluxes are magnified by foreground galaxy excess , and demagnified by foreground galaxy deficit , compared to a smooth universe case . 
 the difference between most magnified and most demagnified sne is about 0.3 - 0.4 mag . 
 the effect is significant at @xmath2 level . 
 simple modeling reveals that the slope of the relation between sn magnitude and foreground galaxy density depends on the amount and distribution of matter along the line of sight to the sources , but does not depend on the specifics of the galaxy biasing scheme .

"tidal interactions play an important role in dynamical processes in the two - body problem in close binary systems : star  star ( binary star ) or star planet . 
 they can lead to such phenomena as synchronization and orbital circularization ( hut 1981 ; zahn 1977 ) as well as to the tidal capture ( press and teukolsky 1977 ) or disruption of an object ( star ) ( ivanov and novikov 2001 ) and the fall of the object onto the star ( rasio et al . 
 1996 ; penev et al . 2012 ; bolmont and mathis 2016 ) . in this paper 
 we consider the tidal interaction of two bodies : a star and a point source . 
 the point source can be both a star ( a neutron star , a white dwarf , etc . ) and a planet . 
 below we will call the point source a planet by implying that this can also be a star . 
 since the evolution time scales of the eccentricity or semimajor axis strongly depend on the orbital period of the binary system and for some stellar models can take values up to 108 yr or more for periods of about 5 days ( ivanov et al . 2013 ; chernov et al . 2013 ) , the evolution of the star itself should be taken into account on such time scales . 
 as the star evolves , the orbital parameters change due to tidal interactions . in this paper 
 we investigate the dynamical tides by taking into account the stellar evolution . for our study 
 we chose three types of stars with masses of one , one and a half , and two solar masses . 
 we consider all stars without allowance for their rotation and magnetic field and touch on the stellar physics itself superficially , as far as this problem requires . 
 the star of one solar mass at lifetimes @xmath3 yr closely corresponds to our sun and has a radiative core and a convective envelope on the main sequence . 
 the other two stars of one and a half and two solar masses are more massive and have a more complex structure . 
 these stars have a convective core and a radiative envelope on the main sequence ( a more precise structure is presented below ) . 
 the problem of determining the tidal evolution is reduced to the problem of determining the normal modes of stellar perturbations and to calculating the energy and angular momentum exchange in the star.planet system ( ivanov and papaloizou 2004 , 2010 ; papaloizou and ivanov 2010 ; lanza and mathis 2016 ) . 
 the low - frequency g - modes of the stellar oscillations play an important role in the theory of dynamical tides . 
 the tidal interactions are fairly intense at small periastron distances of the planet . for a periastron distance @xmath4 au , the dimensionless excitation frequency is @xmath5 , which corresponds to g - modes . 
 a large number of exoplanets in stellar systems have been discovered in the last few years owing to the kepler , superwasp , and other observational programs . in particular , 
 short - period massive planets with an orbital period of a few days , the so - called hot jupiters , have been detected ( winn 2015 ) . as a rule , 
 the hot jupiters have low eccentricities , which points to the importance of tidal interactions ( ogilvie 2014 ) . 
 the results of this paper can be directly applied to some of such systems . 
 for example , the system ybp1194 is a solar twin ( brucalassi et al . 
 a planet with a mass of 0.34@xmath6 and a period of only 6.9 days revolves around this star . 
 for such a short - period planet the dynamical tides must be fairly intense and must affect the orbital evolution . 
 predictions about the subsequent evolution of this planet can be made by analyzing this system . 
 one of the results of this evolution is the fall of the planet onto the star . 
 the possibility of such a fall has been considered in many papers ( see , e.g. , rasio et al . 
 1996 ; penev et al . 2012 
 ; weinberg et al . 2012 ; essick and weinberg 2016 ) . rasio et al . 
 ( 1996 ) considered the possibility of the fall of the planet onto the star due to quasi - static tides and provided a plot for solar - like stars that shows the threshold , as a function of planetary mass and orbital period , below which the planet falls onto the star . 
 penev et al . 
 ( 2012 ) considered tides with a constant tidal quality factor @xmath7 specified phenomenologically . in reality , this factor will depend on the planet s orbital period ( ivanov et al . 
 2013 ) and stellar age . 
 essick and weinberg ( 2016 ) took into account the energy dissipation due to nonlinear interaction of modes with one another . 
 in contrast to our approach ( ivanov et al . 
 2013 ; chernov et al . 
 ( 2013 ) , the simultaneous solution of a large number of ordinary differential equations for each stellar model is suggested , with only solar - type stars having been considered . 
 in this paper we consider the evolution of stars with masses of one , one and a half , and two solar masses . 
 data on the stars are presented in tables 1 3 . 
 a novelty of this study is a consistent allowance for the stellar evolution . for each moment of the star 
 s lifetime we calculated the spectra of normal modes , the overlap integrals ( press and teukolsky 1977 ) , which are a measure of the intensity of tidal interactions ( for a generalization to the case of a rotating star , see papaloizou and ivanov 2005 ; ivanov and papaloizou 2007 ) , and the time scales of the orbital parameters ( the tidal quality factor @xmath7 ) . 
 the overlap integrals are directly related to the tidal resonance coefficients that were introduced by cowling ( 1941 ) ( see also rocca 1987 ; zahn 1970 ) . 
 all of the quantities marked by a tilde are dimensionless ; the normalization is presented in appendix a. 
 such a quantity as the overlap integral q is of great importance in the theory of dynamical tides . 
 it is specified by the expression ( press and teukolsky 1977 ; zahn 1970 ) @xmath8 where m is the stellar mass , r is the stellar radius , and @xmath9 is the dimensionless overlap integral ; the remaining quantities and their dimensionless forms are defined in appendix a. the overlap integral serves as a measure of the intensity of the tidal forces and plays a crucial role in the physics of dynamical tides ( press and teukolsky 1977 ; zahn 1970 , 1975 , 1977 ) . here 
 , we will consider only the quadrupole part of the tidal forces @xmath10 , because it is this part that makes the greatest contribution to the overlap integral ( press and teukolsky 1977 ) . 
 the change in orbital semimajor axis and eccentricity with time is determined from the energy and angularmomentum conservation laws and is specified by the following formulas ( ivanov et al . 
 2013 ) : @xmath11 here , @xmath12 is the orbital eccentricity , @xmath13 is the semimajor axis , and the time scales of the change in semimajor axis @xmath14 and eccentricity @xmath15 in the case of low eccentricities ( @xmath16 ) are specified by the relations ( ivanov et al . 
 2013 ) @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the planetary mass . 
 the rate of change of energy @xmath19 , @xmath20 in the case of a dense spectrum and moderately large viscosities is specified by eqs . 
 ( 51 ) from ivanov et al . 
 the spectrum is deemed to be dense enough if @xmath21 . for simplicity 
 , we will consider here only the time scales of the changes in semimajor axis . 
 using formulas from subsection 7.1 of the paper by ivanov et al . 
 ( 2013 ) , we obtain @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the ratio of the planetary mass to the stellar mass , @xmath24 is the difference between adjacent frequencies , @xmath25 is the frequency number , and @xmath26 ( ivanov et al . 
 . the orbital period of the planet around the star is specified by the relation @xmath27 below , using eqs . 
 ( [ ta ] ) and ( [ porb ] ) and solving eq . 
 ( [ tate ] ) , we will present the change in the planet s orbital period as a function of time by taking into account the stellar evolution .    as is clear from eq . 
 ( [ overlapsintegral ] ) , the eigenfunctions and , accordingly , eigenfrequencies of the stellar oscillations should be known to calculate the overlap integral . 
 there exist three types of eigenfrequencies for a nonrotating star : the so - called p- , f- , and g - modes . 
 we will be concerned only with the low - frequency g- modes . 
 the properties of the g - modes are determined by the brunt - v@xmath28is@xmath29l@xmath29 frequency . 
 it is specified as follows ( christensen - dalsgaard 1998 ) : @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the pressure , @xmath32 is the density , @xmath33 is the gravitational acceleration , @xmath34 is the adiabatic index . 
 however , this definition of the brunt - v@xmath28is@xmath29l@xmath29 frequency is difficult to apply to many stars . 
 this is related to the numerical errors , to the calculation of the derivative of the density , and to the fact that there exist regions in stars where both terms in parentheses can be of the same order of magnitude . 
 therefore , a different definition is used ( brassard et al . 1991 ) : @xmath35,\end{aligned}\ ] ] where @xmath36 the temperature gradient @xmath37 @xmath38 is the mass fraction of atoms of type i , and @xmath39 it is convenient to divide the brunt - v@xmath28is@xmath29l@xmath29 frequency into two parts : the structural part ( structure terms ) brunt - v@xmath28is@xmath29l@xmath29 @xmath40\end{aligned}\ ] ] and the compositional part @xmath41 the compositional part is related to the change in stellar chemical composition due to nuclear reactions , and it is of great importance at the boundary of the convective and radiative regions . 
 another important stellar characteristic is the acoustic frequency defined by the formula @xmath42    the low - frequency g - modes are excited at @xmath43 . 
 the high - frequency p - modes are excited at @xmath44 . 
 we will not consider the p - modes , because they play a secondary role in the theory of dynamical tides . 
 thus , the problem is reduced to finding the eigenfunctions and eigenfrequencies of the stellar oscillations , calculating the overlap integrals , and calculating the characteristic orbital parameters as a function of time . 
 the equations that describe the eigenfrequencies and eigenfunctions of a star in the adiabatic and cowling approximations are presented in appendix a. the stars were modeled with the mesa software package ( paxton et al . 
 2011 , 2013 , 2015 ) ; the data obtained were then interpolated by the steffen ( 1990 ) method to two million points . using these data 
 , we solved the eigenfrequency and eigenfunction problem and calculated the overlap integrals . 
 the fourth - order runge 
 kutta method was used to solve the differential equations . 
 the data for the stars and the overlap integrals were compared with those from ivanov et al . 
 ( 2013 ) and chernov et al . 
 in this section we present the results of our calculations of the change in the planet s orbital period for three types of stars with masses of one , one and a half , and two solar masses . 
 the course of stellar evolution for these models is shown on the hertzsprung russell diagram depicted in fig . 
 data for each star are presented in the tables in appendix b. the main phase of stellar evolution is the main - sequence phase . 
 it is at this phase that any star spends most of its lifetime . 
 this phase is indicated in fig . 1 by the nearly horizontal straight line .          in this section we present the results of our calculations of the overlap integrals for various lifetimes of the star of one solar mass and the change in the planet s orbital period with time . 
 the star was modeled from @xmath45 to @xmath46 yr . at 
 times @xmath47 yr this star closely corresponds to our sun , and below we will call this star the sun . at the initial time the sun was completely convective , hydrogen burning has not yet begun , and its metallicity is z = 0.02 . 
 figure 2 shows a dimensionless dependence of the solar density on radius at the initial and subsequent times . 
 is@xmath29l@xmath29 frequency ( b ) for the sun versus radius for various times : the dashed , dotted , solid , and dash  dotted lines are for the ages @xmath45 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 , and @xmath46 yr , respectively.,title=""fig:"",scaledwidth=45.0% ] is@xmath29l@xmath29 frequency ( b ) for the sun versus radius for various times : the dashed , dotted , solid , and dash  dotted lines are for the ages @xmath45 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 , and @xmath46 yr , respectively.,title=""fig:"",scaledwidth=45.0% ]    is@xmath29l@xmath29 frequency versus radius for the solar age @xmath49 : the solid , dashed , and dash - dotted lines indicate the total brunt - v@xmath28is@xmath29l@xmath29 frequency @xmath50 , the structural part @xmath51 , and the compositional part @xmath52 , respectively.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    the course of stellar evolution and the excitation of eigenmodes can be described as follows . at times 
 @xmath53 yr the sun was completely convective ( @xmath54 ) and , therefore , no low - frequency g - modes were excited , but only the high - frequency f- and p - modes were excited . subsequently , 
 as the sun evolves ( at times @xmath55 yr ) a radiative region ( radiative core ) where the brunt - v@xmath28is@xmath29l@xmath29 frequency is greater than zero ( @xmath56 ) appears and , consequently , the excitation of low - frequency g - modes begins . 
 only the structural part makes a major contribution to the brunt - v@xmath28is@xmath29l@xmath29 frequency ; the compositional part is zero . 
 this is because at such lifetimes of the sun hydrogen burning makes a minor contribution to the energetics and evolution dynamics of the sun . 
 in the course of subsequent evolution the radiative region expands , the number of lowfrequency g - modes increases , and their spectrum becomes dense . 
 the low - frequency g - modes begin to play an increasingly important role . at times 
 @xmath57 yr hydrogen burning begins to make an increasingly large contribution to the total energy of the star and , consequently , the compositional part of the brunt - v@xmath28is@xmath29l@xmath29 frequency also begins to contribute to the total frequency . 
 in the course of subsequent evolution , as hydrogen burns , this contribution becomes progressively larger . 
 one of the problems being investigated here is to take into account the evolution of the brunt - v@xmath28is@xmath29l@xmath29 frequency and the influence of this evolution on the tidal interactions . 
 the radiative region expands approximately to a radius @xmath58 . for the present sun 
 the boundary between the radiative and convective regions is @xmath59 . in fig . 
 2 the brunt - v@xmath28is@xmath29l@xmath29 frequency is plotted against radius for various stellar evolution times . 
 it can be seen from the plot that the brunt - v@xmath28is@xmath29l@xmath29 frequency is subject to significant changes as the solar age increases ; both the frequency spectrum and its density change accordingly , which can directly affect the tidal forces . in fig . 
 3 the brunt - v@xmath28is@xmath29l@xmath29 frequency is plotted against radius for the present sun . 
 it follows from this plot that the brunt - v@xmath28is@xmath29l@xmath29 frequency exhibits a double - humped structure . 
 the first and second humps are associated with the compositional and structural parts of the brunt - v@xmath28is@xmath29l@xmath29 frequency , respectively . at a solar age 
 @xmath60 yr the two contributions become comparable .    the overlap integrals ( 1 ) are plotted against frequency in the cowling approximation in fig . 
 4 . for a solar age @xmath53 yr , 
 as has been said above , only the f- and p - modes exist ; therefore , there is no low - frequency part of the spectrum . 
 it can be seen from the plot that the absolute value of the overlap integrals decreases in the low - frequency part of the spectrum as the sun evolves . 
 this decrease is gradual , because the stellar structure does not change in the evolution time of the sun . on the main sequence 
 the sun always has a radiative core and a convective envelope . 
 in the high - frequency part of the spectrum , as the stellar age increases , the absolute value of the overlap integrals increases and a characteristic structure appears in the spectrumin the form of kinks .    , @xmath48 , @xmath49 , and @xmath46 yr , respectively.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    figure 5 plots the change in the orbital period ( in days ) of a planet with a mass of one jupiter mass around the sun with time ( in years ) . the solar evolution models for which the overlap integrals were calculated are presented in table 1 . at lifetimes of the sun @xmath61 
 yr the spectrum at frequencies @xmath62 is insufficiently dense . at other lifetimes of the sun 
 the spectrum may be deemed sufficiently dense with a good accuracy for all frequencies . 
 therefore , eq . ( 4 ) may be used . 
 equation ( 2 ) was integrated over time from @xmath63 to @xmath64 yr . 
 the initial orbital periods of the planet around the sun were taken to be @xmath65 days ( solid curves ) . 
 it follows from fig . 
 5 that in the main - sequence lifetime of the sun a planet with a mass of one jupiter mass with the initial orbital period @xmath66 days will reduce its orbital period to @xmath67 days due to dynamical tides . 
 the time scale of the change in semimajor axis for this orbital period @xmath67 days and this solar age @xmath64 yr is @xmath68 yr . 
 consequently , it can be said with confidence that this planet will fall onto the sun within several tens of millions of years . 
 the same analysis showed that a planet with the initial orbital period @xmath69 days would reduce its orbital period to @xmath70 days and would fall onto the sun only within approximately half a billion years . 
 for the initial orbital period @xmath69 days fig . 5 compares the changes in orbital period with allowance for the solar evolution ( solid curve ) , without allowance for the solar evolution ( dash  dotted curve ) , and the one calculated using eq . 
 ( 25 ) from essick and weinberg ( 2016 ) ( dotted curve ) . to calculate the change in orbital period without allowance for the solar evolution 
 , we took the time scale at the solar age @xmath0 yr . 
 all curves qualitatively coincide , and the influence of solar evolution may be disregarded in the estimation . 
 this is because hydrogen burning in the sun is gradual , and no change in structure occurs . 
 quantitatively , the dotted curve from essick and weinberg ( 2016 ) gives smaller changes in the planet s orbital period . 
 this may be related to both the neglect of the change in the time scales of the orbital parameters as the sun evolves and to a different approach in this paper to the problem of the energy dissipation of tidally excited modes associated with their nonlinear interactions .          in this subsection 
 we present the results of our calculations of the overlap integrals and the change in orbital period for the star with a mass of one and a half solar masses . 
 the star is considered from the time the protostar begins to collapse . 
 this time is quite arbitrary and is @xmath72 yr ; the initial radius is @xmath73 . 
 the initial metallicity of the star is @xmath74 . at lifetimes of the star up to @xmath75 yr it is completely convective ( @xmath54 ) . in such a star no lowfrequency g - modes 
 are excited , and only the highfrequency f- and p - modes are present ; therefore , the effective energy and angular momentum transfer from the orbit to the star will be suppressed . 
 as the stellar age increases further , hydrogen burning begins at the stellar center and a radiative core appears ( @xmath56 ) , which begins to expand , encompassing progressively newer layers . 
 the star has a well - defined convective envelope and a radiative core . 
 the radiative region expands up to @xmath76 for the age @xmath77 yr . a fairly dense spectrum of low - frequency g - modes appears very rapidly in such a star 
 .    at times @xmath78 yr the stellar structure changes completely . 
 a convective core appears in the star , while its envelope becomes completely radiative . 
 the star abruptly contracts from a radius @xmath79 to @xmath80 . 
 the evolution time scales of the orbital parameters ( 2 ) increase sharply . 
 the star passes from a solar - type star that has a radiative core and a convective envelope to a star with a convective core and a radiative envelope .

 6 the stellar density and brunt - v@xmath28is@xmath29l@xmath29 frequency are plotted against radius for various times . from the figure 
 we see how the central density increased as the star contracted . 
 it can be seen from the figure for the brunt - v@xmath28is@xmath29l@xmath29 frequency that the star was initially completely convective ( dashed curve ) and subsequently a solar - type one ( the envelope was convective , and the core was radiative ; the dotted curve ) . at the subsequent times 
 the star has a more complex structure , the core becomes convective , and the envelope is completely radiative ( solid curve ) . 
 a thin convective envelope then again appears in its envelope ( dash  dotted curve ) .

 . the dashed line does not extend to the lowfrequency part of the spectrum , because the star at this time is completely convective ( @xmath54 ) . 
 it can also be seen from the figure that the absolute value of the overlap integrals rapidly drops by more than two orders of magnitude as the star s lifetime increases . 
 such catastrophic changes are due to the change in stellar structure . 
 in the high - frequency part the absolute value of the overlap integrals increases by an order of magnitude , and characteristic kinks appear in the spectrum . 
 figure 9 plots the change in the orbital period ( in days ) of a planet with a mass of one jupiter mass around the star of one and a half solar masses with time ( in years ) . 
 the stellar evolutionmodels for which the overlap integrals were calculated are presented in table 2 . 
 equation ( 2 ) was integrated over time from @xmath85 to @xmath86 yr . 
 for such a stellar lifetime interval the g - mode spectrum is sufficiently dense . 
 the initial orbital periods of the planet around the sun are @xmath87 days ( solid curves ) . 
 it follows from the figure that all planets with a mass equal to one jupiter mass and with an initial orbital period of 2 days or shorter will fall onto the star in the main - sequence lifetime of the star . 
 a planet with the initial orbital period @xmath88 days will fall onto the star , while a planet with the initial orbital period @xmath89 days will reduce its orbital period to @xmath90 days in the main - sequence lifetime of the star . 
 the dashed curve indicates the change in orbital period without allowance for the stellar evolution . 
 the time scale of the orbital change was taken at the star s lifetime @xmath91 yr . 
 it can be seen from fig . 
 9 that the planet does not fall onto the star in the mainsequence lifetime of the star without allowance for its evolution . 
 the last star that we will consider is the star with a mass of two solar masses . 
 the time the protostar begins to collapse is @xmath92 yr , the initial stellar radius is @xmath93 , and the stellar metallicity is @xmath74 . at initial times up to @xmath94 
 yr the star is completely convective ( @xmath54 ) . 
 no low - frequency g - modes are excited ; only the high - frequency f- and p - modes are present . 
 the dynamical tides play no significant role in such a star . 
 however , as the star evolves further , at times @xmath94 yr a radiative region ( radiative core ) appears in the star , which begins to expand . 
 the low - frequency g - modes are well excited in this region ( @xmath56 ) , and the dynamical tides begin to play an increasingly significant role as the star evolves further . 
 such a star resembles solartype stars that have a radiative core and a convective envelope . 
 the radiative region expands quite rapidly , and this region almost reaches the stellar surface @xmath95 already at times @xmath96 yr . the star becomes almost completely radiative ; the brunt - v@xmath28is@xmath29l@xmath29 frequency in the entire region becomes positive ( @xmath56 ) in the entire region , except for the stellar surface . 
 a sufficiently dense g - mode spectrum is generated in such a star . in fig .

 the compositional part of the brunt - v@xmath28is@xmath29l@xmath29 frequency @xmath52 begins to play an increasingly large role at the boundary between the convective and radiative regions ( fig . 
 .    the stellar structure does not undergo significant changes as the lifetime increases further . 
 only the convective core evolves . 
 initially , the convective region expands , and then its expansion is replaced by contraction ( fig .

 . the dashed line does not extend to the low - frequency part of the spectrum , because the star at this time is completely convective ( @xmath54 ) . as the star s lifetime increases , the absolute value of the overlap integral rapidly drops by more than an order of magnitude . 
 such catastrophic changes are due to the change in stellar structure . when the stellar structure undergoes no significant changes , the overlap integrals change gradually and insignificantly ( see fig . 
 12 , the solid and dash - dotted lines ) . 
 figure 13 plots the change in the orbital period ( in days ) of a planet with a mass of one jupiter mass around the star of two solar masses with time ( in years ) . 
 the evolution models of the star of two solar masses for which the overlap integrals were calculated are presented in table 3 . 
 equation ( 2 ) was integrated over time from @xmath102 to @xmath103 yr . 
 for such a stellar lifetime interval the g - mode spectrum is sufficiently dense . 
 the initial orbital periods of the planet around the sun were taken to be @xmath104 days ( solid curves ) . 
 it follows from the figure that all planets with a mass equal to one jupiter mass and with an initial orbital period of 2 days or shorter will fall onto the star in the main - sequence lifetime of the star ( fig . 
 a planet with the initial orbital period @xmath89 days will reduce its orbital period only to @xmath105 days in the main - sequence lifetime of the star . 
 the dashed curve indicates the change in orbital period without allowance for the stellar evolution . 
 the time scale of the orbital change was taken at the star s lifetime @xmath106 yr . as can be seen from fig . 
 13 , the planet does not fall onto the star in the main - sequence lifetime of the star without allowance for its evolution . 
 q        just as for the star of one and a half solar masses , the evolution time scales ( 3 ) of the planet decrease as the star begins to move off the main sequence . 
 this is because the hydrogen reserves at the stellar center begin to be depleted , and the convective core becomes a helium one . 
 this leads to an expansion of the star and , consequently , to an increase in the number of g - modes and the density of the spectrum , which leads to an increase in the pumping of orbital energy into the energy of stellar oscillations and to the fall of short - period planets onto the star . 
 we considered the change in the orbital period of a planet around a star with a mass of one , one and a half , and two solar masses . 
 the behavior of the overlap integrals for these models as a function of the main - sequence lifetime of the star was analyzed . 
 we showed that for the same star with a different structure during its evolution the overlap integrals could differ by two or more orders of magnitude . 
 we showed that all planets with a mass of one jupiter mass that revolve around the sun with an orbital period @xmath1 days or shorter should fall onto the stellar surface in the main - sequence lifetime of the star . 
 all planets with a mass of one jupiter mass that revolve around the stars with a mass of one and a half and two solar masses with an orbital period @xmath2 or shorter will fall onto the stellar surface in the main - sequence lifetime of the star . 
 such a fall may not occur without allowance for the evolution of the star itself . 
 these results qualitatively agree with the previous results from bolmont and mathis ( 2016 ) and penev ( 2012 ) . 
 calculations for the stellar models considered in this paper should be made for a more accurate quantitative estimate .

 the boundary conditions at the stellar center @xmath117 are @xmath118 the boundary conditions on the stellar surface @xmath119 are @xmath120 there exists the cowling ( 1941 ) approximation , in which the perturbed gravitational potential is neglected , to investigate the low - frequency g - modes . 
 this approximation holds good and simplifies considerably the system of equations for the adiabatic perturbations ( 14 ) . in the cowling approximation 
 the system of equations ( 14 ) will be rewritten in a simpler form : @xmath121 in the cowling approximation the system of equations ( 18 ) ceases to depend explicitly on the stellar density . 
 thus , in the low - frequency limit the radial and horizontal displacements do not depend on the stellar density . 
 in contrast , the overlap integrals ( 1 ) directly depend on the density . in the cowling approximation not four but two

 this requires that the determinant composed of the eigenfunctions of the system of equations ( 14 ) or ( 18 ) be equal to zero . 
 this will hold only for some frequencies ( eigenfrequencies ) of the system of equations ( 14 ) or ( 18 ) , which determines the perturbation spectrum .

"in many studies of cell mechanics and dynamics , the cell is characterized as a viscoelastic body @xcite . 
 it is an intriguing question to what extent such mechanical behaviour can be rationalized in terms of comparatively simple polymer physics models . in this respect , 
 the comparison of cell rheological data and minimalistic _ in vitro _ reconstituted constructs of the cytoskeleton , such as pure actin solutions @xcite or crosslinked actin networks @xcite , has recently provided many new insights . 
 important progress has also been achieved in the development of phenomenological mathematical descriptions . 
 this includes approaches related to the tube model @xcite , tensegrity - based approaches @xcite , effective - medium models @xcite , and some others @xcite . in particular 
 , the glassy wormlike chain ( ) model @xcite , a phenomenological extension of the standard  model of semiflexible polymers @xcite has been successful in describing a plethora of rheological data for polymer solutions @xcite and living cells @xcite over many decades in time with a minimum of parameters . 
 however , all these studies were primarily concerned with _ viscoelastic _ 
 behaviour , while the latest investigations have underscored the glassy @xcite fragile @xcite , and inelastic @xcite character of the mechanical response of living cells . 
 even for biopolymer networks _ in vitro _ 
 , experiments operating in the nonlinear regime had so far to resort to special protocols that minimize plastic flow @xcite in order to make contact with dedicated theoretical models .    the aim of the present contribution is to overcome this restriction by extending the  to situations involving inelastic deformations . as a first step , we concentrate onto _ reversible inelastic _ 
 behaviour , where the deformation does not alter the microscopic ground state . 
 the protocol applied by trepat _ 
 et al . _ 
 @xcite provides a paradigmatic example . 
 cells are subjected to a transient stretch such that , after some additional waiting time in the unstretched state , the ( linear ) material properties of the initial state are recovered . the simplification for the theoretical modelling results from the assumption that not only the macro - state but also the micro - state of the system may to a good approximation be treated as reversible under such conditions ; i.e. 
 , we assume that the complete conformation of the polymer network , including the transiently broken bonds between adjacent polymers , is constrained to eventually return to its original equilibrium state . for the time - delayed hysteretic response of the network to such protocols one could thus still speak of a viscoelastic ( `` anelastic '' ) response in an operational sense , but we refrain from doing so in view of the fundamentally inelastic nature of the underlying stochastic process  in contrast to the reversible softening effects observed in @xcite , for example . 
 indeed , by simply allowing bonds to reform in new conformational states , the model developed below can readily be extended to arbitrary irreversible plastic deformations , as will be demonstrated elsewhere @xcite . before entering the discussion of our model 
 , we would also like to point out that the proposed ( inelastic ) extension of the  is strongly constrained by identifying the newly introduced parameters with those of the original ( viscoelastic )  model , where possible . despite its increased complexity , the extended model will therefore enable us to subject the underlying physical picture to a more stringent test than hitherto possible by comparing its predictions to dedicated experiments . moreover , unlike current state - of - the - art simulation studies @xcite it is not limited to rod networks but is firmly routed in a faithful mathematical description of the underlying brownian polymer dynamics .    this paper is organized as follows . 
 first , we review some basic facts about the  in section [ sec : gwlc ] . next , in section [ sec : interaction ] 
 , we introduce our extended reversible inelastic version , which we formulate using the notion of an effective interaction potential as in the original construction of the  in @xcite . 
 ( a preliminary account of the basic procedure and some of its cell - biological motivation including reversible bond - breaking kinetics has recently been given in a conference proceedings @xcite . ) sections [ sec : viscoelastic ] and [ sec : fluidization ] explain the physical mechanism underlying the mechanical response under pulsed and periodically pulsed loading , while section [ sec : remodelling ] illustrates its phenomenology . we demonstrate that the model exhibits the hallmarks of nonlinear cell mechanics : strain / stress stiffening , fluidization , and cyclic softening @xcite . 
 section [ sec : intr_lengths ] investigates the relevance of the lately quantified structural heterogeneities in networks of semiflexible polymers @xcite for the mechanical properties , before we conclude and close with a brief outlook . 
 the glassy wormlike chain ( ) is a phenomenological extension of the wormlike chain ( ) model , the well - established standard model of semiflexible polymers . 
 a broad overview over  and  dynamics can be found elsewhere @xcite . 
 the  describes the mechanics of an isolated semiflexible polymer in an isothermal viscous solvent . in the weakly bending rod approximation , 
 a solution of the stochastic differential equations of motion for the  is possible _ via _ a mode decomposition ansatz for the transverse displacement of the polymer contour from the straight ground state . 
 the individual modes labelled by an index @xmath0 are independent of each other and decay exponentially with rates @xmath1 . for convenience , 
 we set the thermal energy @xmath2 , so that the bending rigidity can be identified with the persistence length @xmath3 , in the following . using this convention , 
 the  expression for the transverse susceptibility of a polymer of contour length @xmath4 ( with respect to a point force ) reads @xcite @xmath5 here , @xmath6 is an optional backbone tension , and @xmath7 the euler buckling force for a hinged rod of length @xmath4 . 
 the different powers of @xmath0 in the denominator give notice of the competition of bending and stretching forces . 
 in the , interactions of the polymer with the surrounding network ( e.g.  excluded volume interactions or sticky contacts ) are reflected in an altered  mode relaxation spectrum @xcite . the intuitive  albeit not fully microscopic  picture underlying the formulation of the  is illustrated in figure  [ fig : cartoon ] , which depicts a test polymer reversibly bound to the background network _ via _ potential wells at all topological contacts , the so - called entanglement points . 
 consider now a generic point somewhere along the polymer backbone ( not an entanglement point ) . 
 it can relax freely until the constrictions are being felt , which slow down the contributions from long wavelength bending modes . 
 the  translates this intuition into a simple prescription for the mode spectrum : the short - wavelength modes are directly taken over from the wormlike chain model , while modes of wavelength @xmath8 longer than the typical contour length @xmath9 between adjacent bonds are modified to account for the slowdown . motivated by the physical picture illustrated in figure [ fig : cartoon ] , the slowdown of the relaxation of a wavelength @xmath8 is expressed by an arrhenius factor @xmath10 $ ] for breaking @xmath11 potential energy barriers of height @xmath12 simultaneously . 
 accordingly , the phenomenological recipe to turn a  into a reads : @xmath13 & \lambda_n \geq \lambda \end{array}\right . . \ ] ] upon inserting this into ( [ eq : sus_wlc ] ) one obtains the susceptibility @xmath14 . 
 the microscopic `` modulus '' for transverse point excitations of a generic backbone element on a test polymer is then defined as the inverse susceptibility , @xmath15 . 
 an approximate expression for the macroscopic shear modulus is obtained along similar lines @xcite .    in the original equilibrium  theory , @xmath9 was assumed to be a constant on the order of the entanglement length of the network , @xmath16 . 
 note , however , that @xmath17 is a geometric quantity ( which is determined by the polymer concentration and the persistence length ) while the contour length @xmath9 between closed bonds clearly depends on the state of the bond network . 
 one therefore has to allow for an increase of @xmath9 with the number of broken bonds in non - equilibrium applications . 
 this issue is explored in the following . 
 all mechanical quantities calculated within the  model crucially depend on the interaction length @xmath9 . in previous applications of the model @xcite it was assumed that @xmath9 remains constant  equal to its equilibrium value and unaffected by the deformation of the sample . in other words , 
 the equilibrium theory allowed for statistical bond fluctuations but not for a dynamical evolution of the parameters characterizing the thermodynamic state of the bond network . 
 an obvious starting point for generalizations of the model to non - equilibrium situations is therefore to consider the number of closed bonds , and therefore also @xmath9 , as _ dynamic variables _ , dependent on the strain- and stress - history of the network . 
 we now provide a mean - field description to account for such a dynamically evolving bond network . for clarity , we return to the intuitive picture underlying the where the ( possibly crosslinker- or molecular - motor - mediated ) complex interactions between the polymers are summarized into an effective interaction potential for a test segment against the background , as sketched in figure [ fig : potential ] . 
 the same idea has also been used before in many related situations ( e.g.@xcite ) .     between both states . 
 the transition rates @xmath18 and @xmath19 between the bound and unbound state depend on the barrier heights @xmath12 and @xmath20 , respectively . 
 an externally applied force can tilt the potential and favour binding or unbinding events.,width=9 ]    the generic potential exhibits three essential features : a well - defined bound state , a well - defined unbound state , and a barrier in between ( figure [ fig : potential ] ) . 
 the confining well corresponding to the unbound state represents the tube - like caging of the test polymer within the surrounding network @xcite . 
 for ease of notation , we further introduce the dimensionless fraction of closed bonds or , _ bond fraction _ 
 @xmath21 which is simply the ensemble - averaged fraction of sticky contacts that are actually in the bound state . 
 the minimum bond distance @xmath22 is typically on the order of @xmath17 , but may be somewhat larger in situations where the bonds are mediated by crosslinker molecules or by partially sterically inaccessible sticky patches ( as e.g.  for helical molecules @xcite ) .    a quantitatively fully consistent way of calculating the dynamics of @xmath23 would involve solving the full fokker - planck equation for a -contact  a formidable program to be pursued elsewhere @xcite . here , 
 for the sake of our qualitative purposes , we chose to concentrate onto the physical essence of the discussion , and keep the mathematical structure as simple and transparent as possible . 
 we therefore approximate the dynamics by a simple exponential relaxation as familiar from the standard example of reacting brownian particles , conventionally described by kramers theory with a bell - like force dependence @xcite . using this simplification and assuming a schematic interaction potential as depicted in figure  [ fig : potential ] , the value of @xmath23 is determined by a competition of bond breaking and bond formation with reaction rates @xmath18 and @xmath19 , respectively . 
 both rates are represented in the usual adiabatic approximation ( meaning that the equilibration _ inside _ the wells is much faster than the barrier crossing and external perturbations ) by @xcite @xmath24 where @xmath25 is an intrinsic characteristic brownian time scale for bond breaking and formation and @xmath26 are characterized by different brownian time scales depending on the width of the potential wells . at the present stage , we do not bother to distinguish these time scales nor to fine - tune their numerical values , and identify them , for the sake of simplicity , with the entanglement time scale @xmath27 in our numerical calculations . 
 ] , and @xmath6 is the force pulling on the bond . noting that the fraction of open bonds is @xmath28 , we can then write down the following rate equation for the fraction of closed bonds @xmath29 the time dependence of @xmath30 leads via ( [ eq : nu_lambda ] ) to an implicit time dependence of the -parameter @xmath31 and thereby of all observables derived from the . 
 the time - dependent force @xmath32 in ( [ eq : rate ] ) may be thought to result from an externally imposed stress protocol or from internal dynamical elements such as molecular motors setting the network under dynamic stress . 
 hence , via an appropriately chosen set of slowly changing state parameters @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 ,   the model can in principle accommodate for the active biological remodelling in living cells and tissues @xcite . 
 ( for a discussion of the relation between the microscopic @xmath6 and the macroscopic stress , see @xcite . ) 
 note that for constant force , the stationary value of @xmath23 , @xmath35\right)^{-1 } , \ ] ] obtained by setting @xmath36 , does not depend on @xmath12 , as it should be ( the steady state is independent of the transition state ) .

 strong perturbations ( stress or strain ) then give rise to a pronounced stiffening due to the steeply nonlinear response of semiflexible polymers under elongation @xcite . 
 this well established behaviour can be understood as the canvas against which we aim to discern the characteristic mechanical signatures of the bond kinetics . 
 an observable that will be of particular interest in the following is the complex microscopic `` modulus '' @xmath48 , introduced in the previous section . 
 it is used to determine the linear as well as ( via a nonlinear update scheme , see [ sec : technical ] ) the nonlinear force response of the system . to understand how the time - dependence ( [ eq : rate ] ) of @xmath23 affects this important quantity , 
 it is instructive to first examine the dependence of @xmath49 on @xmath23 . to this end , we formally consider @xmath23 temporarily as an independent variable instead of determining it from ( [ eq : rate ] ) . 
 note that this approach nevertheless makes sense as for a fixed set of parameters , @xmath23 can still take any value between zero and one . 
 this is due to the freedom of choosing an initial state , which can be imagined to have evolved from the prior deformation history .    for fixed other parameters , both the real part @xmath46 ( figure [ fig : mod_lam]a ) and the imaginary part @xmath50 of @xmath49 increase monotonically with @xmath23 . 
 we emphasize that @xmath50 is not simply proportional to @xmath46 and therefore the loss angle @xmath51 also depends on @xmath23 ( figure [ fig : mod_lam]b ) . for small @xmath23 , the loss angle is large , corresponding to fluid - like behaviour . with increasing @xmath23 , 
 the system becomes more solid - like . 
 increasing the barrier height @xmath12 makes the dependence of @xmath49 on @xmath23 more pronounced ( figure [ fig : mod_lam ] ) . 
 conversely , as can be expected , the dependence on the barrier height @xmath12 vanishes with decreasing bond fraction @xmath23 . 
 note that due to the boundary conditions the limit of a newtonian fluid ( @xmath52 ) is not recovered when formally taking the limit of vanishing bond fraction ( @xmath53 , @xmath54 ) . 
 finally , the potential difference @xmath55 solely determines the dynamics of @xmath23 via ( [ eq : rate ] ) , and therefore influences the modulus @xmath49 solely through the equilibrium value for @xmath23 . 
 after these general considerations , we now concentrate on the nonlinear and non - equilibrium dynamic response of the extended inelastic  model , which results from the coupled relaxation of the viscoelastic polymer network _ and _ the transient bond network .      a convenient way to characterize the mechanical properties of an inelastic material is a force - displacement curve . for a perfectly linear elastic ( hookean ) body , it would simply consist of a straight line , whereas a perfectly plastic body would feature as a rectangle delineated by a yield force @xmath56 and an arbitrary plastic strain value . for our qualitative purpose 
 , we identify the average transverse displacement of the test polymer segment ( which is used to determine the force response , see [ sec : technical ] ) with the reaction coordinate @xmath57 of the schematic potential sketched in figure [ fig : potential ] ; and we identify the force @xmath6 entering the reaction rates with the backbone tension of the test polymer . as a characteristic length scale for the transverse displacements we use the width @xmath58 of the effective confinement potential , which is a measure of a typical mean - square displacement of the polymer in the unbound state . using this convention 
 , we now consider the effect of a time - symmetric displacement pulse on the evolution of the force @xmath32 and bond fraction @xmath30 . for technical convenience 
 , we use a gaussian shape for the displacement pulses , but the qualitative conclusions to be drawn are largely independent of the precise protocol . 
 the duration of the displacement pulse , which sets the time scale for the dynamic response , is used as the unit of time in the following . here , we are not interested in short - time tension - propagation and single - polymer dynamics @xcite , hence a lower bound for pertinent pulse durations is provided by the interaction time scale @xmath59 . on the other hand , for pulse durations longer than @xmath60 
 the system deformation would be quasistatic so that no genuinely dynamic effects of the bond kinetics could be observed .    for a small gaussian displacement pulse of relative amplitude @xmath61 ( c.f . 
 figure  [ fig : force_displacement]a and [ sec : technical ] ) , the shape of the curve predicted by our inelastic  model shows all features of a _ viscoelastic _ medium ( figure [ fig : force_displacement]b , blue dashed curve ) . 
 it starts with a nearly linear regime for relative displacements @xmath62 , where a weak stiffening sets in . 
 due to dissipation in the medium , the path back to the initial state takes its course at lower force , which causes a weak hysteresis . 
 this is essentially the viscoelastic response that already the bare  model would have predicted .    :

 the bare  predicts a strong stiffening ( figure [ fig : force_displacement]b , red dotted curve ) , whereas the full model exhibits an initial stiffening regime followed by a pronounced softening ( figure [ fig : force_displacement]b , solid red curve ) . 
 a very interesting observation is that `` softening '' in this case does not only mean a decrease of the slope of the force - extension curve , but that the slope actually becomes _ negative _ over an extended parameter region , once an operationally defined threshold force @xmath56 is exceeded . 
 this `` flow state '' bears more resemblance to plastic flow than to viscoelastic relaxation . 
 the reason for this qualitatively new phenomenon is the force - induced bond breaking . 
 theoretically this is best exemplified by the time - dependence of the ( experimentally not easily accessible ) fraction @xmath30 of closed bonds ( figure [ fig : force_displacement]c ) . 
 a glance at the bond fraction during the weak deformation scenario ( figure  [ fig : force_displacement]c , blue dashed curve ) reveals how the limit of a bare  is recovered , namely whenever the deformation is not sufficiently violent and persistent to significantly decrease the fraction of closed bonds . for the large deformation scenario , in contrast , 
 the bond fraction stays only initially constant ( figure  [ fig : force_displacement]c , solid red curve ) . as a consequence of the large strain 
 the force rises steeply , as can be seen from the strong stiffening in figure  [ fig : force_displacement]b ( solid red curve ) . at the yield force 
 , the bond fraction suddenly decreases to nearly half of its initial value during a very short time . 
 the decrease in the bond fraction is accompanied by a somewhat slower drop in the force , which is reflected in the sudden softening of the force - displacement curve . 
 the bond fraction eventually recovers on a much slower time scale , which is roughly given by @xmath74 . 
 note that even though the effects of the inelastic response dominate the stress - strain curve , the viscoelastic relaxations from the underlying  model are still present . 
 they could hardly be disentangled from the inelastic contributions , though , without an underlying faithful model of the viscoelastic response at hand . in summary , we observe a competition between force - amplitude dependent stress - stiffening and force - rate dependent yielding events . 
 if the backbone force stays much smaller than the yield force , the adaptation of the bond network requires an adiabatically long time , on the order of the bond lifetime @xmath75 , so that plain viscoelastic  behaviour is observed on the pulse time scale . in contrast , if the backbone tension @xmath6 reaches the yield force @xmath56 , the bond fraction declines sharply , thereby switching the response from the /-typical stiffening to a pronounced softening . 
 the rate dependence of the yield force @xmath56 can be estimated by setting the time it takes to reach the yield force , @xmath76 , equal to the force - dependent time scale of bond opening , @xmath77 , from ( [ eq : kpm ] ) , @xmath78 here , lw@xmath79 is the positive real branch of the lambert w function . in figure 
 [ fig : force_displacement]d , this estimate is compared with results from numerical evaluations for gaussian displacement pulses at different average rates . 
 apart from the numerical errors , the slight deviations from the estimate may be attributed to the fact that the force rate is not constant for the gaussian protocol . 
 they can be mostly eliminated by using force ramp protocols of various slopes instead of the gaussian displacement pulses . for not too low rates , 
 the rate dependence can be approximated by the even simpler relation @xmath80 where the force rate has to be normalized by a suitable force scale . 
 the minimum bond fraction reached during the application of the pulse , which we interpret as a measure of the degree of fluidization , depends _ non - monotonically _ on the rate ( figure [ fig : force_displacement]d , inset ) . 
 qualitatively , this can be understood by noticing that two different factors influence the fluidization , namely the maximum force attained during deformation and the time over which the force is applied . 
 the maximum force is simply the yield force @xmath56 , with the rate dependence in ( [ eq : rate_fc ] ) and figure [ fig : force_displacement]d , while the reciprocal rate itself sets the time scale . for high rates @xmath81 ( in our example ) 
 the rate - dependence of the maximum force wins and the minimum @xmath23 reached decreases with increasing rate . for low rates , where the rate - dependence of the maximum force is much weaker ( figure [ fig : force_displacement]d ) the minimum @xmath23 decreases with increasing pulse duration , _ viz . 
 _  decreasing rate . note that for slow pulses ( low rates ) , the bond fraction after the pulse may be quite different from the minimum @xmath23 , as significant recovery may already take place during the pulse . 
 the substantial changes in the material properties accompanying bond breaking can be exemplified by monitoring the linear elastic modulus @xmath82 ( measured at a fixed frequency @xmath83 ) in response to a strain pulse ( figure [ fig : modulus]a ) . 
 apart from the usual /-typical stress - stiffening below the threshold force @xmath84 , the modulus is seen to drop _ below _ the value it had before the deformation pulse , where it apparently saturates ( remember that the deformation vanishes for @xmath85 and that the recovery takes roughly a time @xmath86 ) . 
 we thus observe what we call a `` passive '' , `` physical '' remodelling of the bond network as opposed to the `` active '' , `` biological '' remodelling of the cytoskeleton of living cells in response to external stimuli . 
 these passive remodelling effects have recently been observed for human airway smooth muscle cells @xcite . 
 ( a more quantitative discussion of the relation to the experimental observations will be given elsewhere . ) 
 the fact that the deformation pulse leads to a decrease in @xmath46 and an increase in the loss angle @xmath87 ( figure [ fig : modulus]c ) suggests the notion of _ fluidization _ @xcite .     and 
 the bond fraction @xmath23 largely determine the storage modulus @xmath46 and the loss angle @xmath87 : normalized storage modulus @xmath88 ( @xmath63 ) and loss angle @xmath87 ( @xmath66 ) during displacement pulses of large and small amplitudes , 2.2 ( solid ) , 0.73 ( dashed ) ; the stronger deformation pulse causes a strong and persistent overshoot of the loss angle , indicating _ fluidization _ ; slow recovery after the pulse , ( @xmath65 , @xmath68 ) ; parameters as in figure [ fig : force_displacement ] , @xmath89.,title=""fig:"",width=7 ]   and the bond fraction @xmath23 largely determine the storage modulus @xmath46 and the loss angle @xmath87 : normalized storage modulus @xmath88 ( @xmath63 ) and loss angle @xmath87 ( @xmath66 ) during displacement pulses of large and small amplitudes , 2.2 ( solid ) , 0.73 ( dashed ) ; the stronger deformation pulse causes a strong and persistent overshoot of the loss angle , indicating _ fluidization _ ; slow recovery after the pulse , ( @xmath65 , @xmath68 ) ; parameters as in figure [ fig : force_displacement ] , @xmath89.,title=""fig:"",width=7 ]   and the bond fraction @xmath23 largely determine the storage modulus @xmath46 and the loss angle @xmath87 : normalized storage modulus @xmath88 ( @xmath63 ) and loss angle @xmath87 ( @xmath66 ) during displacement pulses of large and small amplitudes , 2.2 ( solid ) , 0.73 ( dashed ) ; the stronger deformation pulse causes a strong and persistent overshoot of the loss angle , indicating _ fluidization _ ; slow recovery after the pulse , ( @xmath65 , @xmath68 ) ; parameters as in figure [ fig : force_displacement ] , @xmath89.,title=""fig:"",width=7 ]   and the bond fraction @xmath23 largely determine the storage modulus @xmath46 and the loss angle @xmath87 : normalized storage modulus @xmath88 ( @xmath63 ) and loss angle @xmath87 ( @xmath66 ) during displacement pulses of large and small amplitudes , 2.2 ( solid ) , 0.73 ( dashed ) ; the stronger deformation pulse causes a strong and persistent overshoot of the loss angle , indicating _ fluidization _ ; slow recovery after the pulse , ( @xmath65 , @xmath68 ) ; parameters as in figure [ fig : force_displacement ] , @xmath89.,title=""fig:"",width=7 ]    the passive remodelling described here is a _ transient _ phenomenon , because , after cessation of the external perturbations , the bond fraction will eventually recover its equilibrium value . 
 this indicates that also the change in the system properties is a transient effect , which is demonstrated by the recovery from fluidization in figure  [ fig : modulus ] b & d. thus , while the fluidization resembles a plastic process on short time scales , on long times scales , the phenomenology is more similar to pseudo- and superelasticity as observed in shape - memory alloys @xcite .    to demonstrate that the transient passive remodelling also affects the nonlinear material properties 
 , we consider a series of three pulses , next ( figure [ fig : stress_strain ] ) . 
 the force response to such a protocol is depicted in figure [ fig : stress_strain]b . 
 the force - displacement curve for the second stretching ( second left branch of the solid curve ) is less steep than for the first stretching ( very left branch of the solid curve ) and the yield force is lower . 
 this indicates a cyclic softening , or viscoelastic shake - down effect , closely related to the fluidization of the network by strain . 
 the strength of the shake - down depends on the fraction of transiently broken bonds , and hence on the rate as well as on the amplitude of the applied deformation ( c.f . 
 figure [ fig : stress_strain]c , solid red curve ) . upon repeated application of deformation pulses 
 the force - displacement curves settle on a limit - curve that is essentially preconditioned by the initial deformation pulse and the inelastic work it performed on the sample . for more gentle protocols that only break a smaller fraction of bonds , 
 the initial fluidization would be not as pronounced and one would obtain a gradual shake - down , which converges to a limit curve only after many cycles .    ) and response ( @xmath65 , @xmath66 ) for three subsequent gaussian strain pulses ; force - displacement curves ( @xmath65 ) for a single minimum interaction distance ( @xmath90 , solid ) and for a distribution of @xmath22 according to @xcite with mean @xmath91 ( dashed ) ; the bond fraction @xmath23 ( @xmath66 ) for @xmath92 ( dash - dotted ) , @xmath93 ( solid ) , and @xmath94 ( dashed ) ; other parameters as in figure [ fig : force_displacement ] .

 title=""fig:"",width=7 ]      so far , we have assumed that there is one well - defined characteristic length scale @xmath22 for the polymer interactions , which is on the order of the entanglement length @xmath17 and interpreted as the minimum average contour distance between adjacent bonds of the test polymer with the background network . 
 this is clearly a mean - field assumption . 
 recent combined experimental and theoretical studies have established that the local tube diameter and entanglement length in pure semiflexible polymer solutions actually exhibit a skewed leptocurtic distribution with broad tails @xcite . to include this information in the above analysis is not straightforward , since the elastic interactions between regions of different entanglement length are not known , _ a priori_. for the sake of a first qualitative estimate , the simplest procedure seems to be to average the above results over a distribution of @xmath22 , corresponding to a parallel connection of independent entanglement elements . 
 qualitatively , this renders the abrupt transition from stiffening to softening somewhat smoother ( c.f . 
 figure [ fig : stress_strain]b , dashed curve ) . 
 moreover , the initial stiffening is slightly more pronounced . 
 this is due to the contributions of @xmath95 , which exhibit both stronger stiffening and fluidization 
 . nevertheless , all qualitative features  like stiffening and remodelling effects and a `` flow state '' indicating fluidization or inelastic shakedown  can still be well discerned . 
 this is consistent with the assumption that pure semiflexible polymer solutions are at least qualitatively well described by a single entanglement length @xcite . 
 we have presented a theoretical framework for a polymer - based description of the inelastic nonlinear mechanical behaviour of sticky biopolymer networks . 
 we represented the polymer network on a mean - field level by a test polymer described by the phenomenologically highly successful  model . beyond the equilibrium statistical fluctuations captured by the original model 
 , we additionally allowed for a dynamically evolving thermodynamic state variable @xmath31 characterizing the network of thermo - reversible sticky bonds , which is updated dynamically upon bond breaking according to an appropriate rate equation . within our approximate treatment 
 we could obtain a number of robust and qualitatively interesting results , which are not sensitive to the precise parameter values chosen , nor to the choice of the transverse rather than the longitudinal susceptibility in ( [ eq : sus_wlc ] ) . 
 for sufficiently strong deformations , changes in the mean fraction of closed bonds , reflected in @xmath31 , can influence material properties to a degree at which the material behaves qualitatively different from the usual viscoelastic paradigm . 
 in particular , our theory predicts a pronounced fluidization response , which develops upon strong deformations on top of the intrinsic viscoelastic stiffening response provided by the individual polymers . 
 after cessation of loading , the system slowly recovers its initial state . 
 these observations are in qualitative agreement with recently published experimental results obtained for living cells @xcite , and a more quantitative comparison with dedicated measurement results for cells and _ in vitro _ 
 biopolymer networks will be the subject of future work . 
 we found the yield force for the onset of the fluidization to be sensitive to the deformation rate . 
 moreover , the fluidization response was shown to be accompanied by a cyclic softening or shake - down effect . 
 taking into account the spatial heterogeneity of biopolymer solutions by a distribution of entanglement lengths leads to a smoothing of the force - displacement curves without affecting their qualitative characteristics . 
 one may still expect qualitatively new effects in situations with unusually broad distributions of entanglement lengths , such as for strongly heterogeneous ( e.g.  phase separating ) networks . 
 a parameter that was found to be very important for cells @xcite but has not been discussed much in this contribution is the _ prestressing force _ 
 @xmath96 ( see appendix [ sec : technical ] ) , which is present in adhering cells even in the absence of external driving . experimentally , it was established that increasing prestress is correlated with a higher stiffness of adhering cells @xcite which in turn is correlated with a higher stiffness of the substrate @xcite . 
 when naively treating the prestressing force just as an additive contribution to the overall force , our model predicts the opposite : the additional force breaks more bonds and the network becomes softer and more fluid - like . to reconcile these apparently contradicting trends , one can appeal to the notion of _ homeostasis _ , which essentially amounts to postulating that the cell actively adapts its structure such that a certain set of thermodynamic state variables remain in a physiologically sensible range @xcite . 
 this basically implies that the cell will respond to stiff substrates or persistent external stresses by a biological remodelling that corresponds to an increase of @xmath12 and @xmath55 , and possibly to a decrease of @xmath22 . by adapting also the internal prestress @xmath96 , 
 the cell may then avoid , apart from the structural collapse , an equally undesirable loss of flexibility . 
 we note , however , that internal stresses are indeed observed to disrupt the cytoskeleton , as implied by the simple physical theory presented here , if they are not permanently balanced by a substrate @xcite . 
 even though the nonlinear effects presented in this contribution depend crucially on the bond kinetics , it should not be overlooked that the  is an equally indispensable ingredient of the complete theory . 
 first , it provides the constitutive relation that gives the force in response to an infinitesimal displacement , which in turn governs the bond kinetics . 
 secondly , the time - dependent linear susceptibility strongly filters the dynamic remodelling of the bond network in practical applications , in which one rarely has access to the microstate of the underlying bond network . in summary , 
 the extended model thus integrates experimentally confirmed features of the  response such as slow relaxation , power - law rheology , viscoelastic hysteresis , and shear stiffening with a simple bond kinetics scheme , which allows less intuitive complex nonlinear physical remodelling effects like fluidization and inelastic shake - down to be addressed . 
 finally , we want to point out that it is straightforward to extend the above analysis in a natural way to account for irreversible plastic deformations @xcite . to this end 
 , one has to allow for the possibility that the transiently broken bonds reform somewhere else than at their original sites ( as always assumed in the foregoing discussion ) after strong deformations with finite residual displacement 
 . this can be included by accommodating an additional term acting as a `` slip rate '' in ( [ eq : rate ] ) @xcite . 
 we acknowledge many fruitful discussions with j.  glaser , s.  sturm , and k.  hallatschek , and financial support from the deutsche forschungsgemeinschaft ( dfg ) through for 877 and , within the german excellence initiative , the leipzig school of natural sciences  building with molecules and nano - objects . 
 the deformation pulse protocol used in this paper is @xmath97 to obtain the full nonlinear response of the ( extended )  to the displacement protocol ( [ eq : strain_gauss ] ) , we make use of the superposition principle : we know that the fourier transform of @xmath98 is the linear response to a small displacement step . 
 after decomposing a finite displacement into infinitesimal displacement steps and a partial integration , we write @xmath99 note that the right hand side of ( [ eq : force ] ) depends on @xmath100 , rendering it a highly nonlinear implicit equation . using ( [ eq : strain_gauss ] ) and integrating by parts , we obtain @xmath101    the next step is to identify a connection between the force in ( [ eq : rate ] ) and @xmath102(t ) . 
 a finite prestressing force @xmath96 is introduced mainly for technical reasons , namely to avoid the unphysical region of negative ( i.e.  compressive ) backbone stress , which would buckle the polymers . 
 while the physics of the prestressed network can essentially be mapped back to that of a network without prestress by a renormalization of the parameters @xmath12 and @xmath55 , prestress may also be seen as an important feature : indeed , the cytoskeleton of adhered cells is well known to be under permanent prestress , and suspended cells seem prone to spontaneous shape oscillations that could be indicative of a propensity of the cells to set themselves under prestress @xcite . in the context and on the longer time scales of the biological remodelling of the cytoskeleton 
 it would therefore make sense to think of @xmath96 as a dynamic force generated by molecular motors and polymerization forces . for the following , however , we take the prestress to be constant so that the force entering ( [ eq : rate ] ) is @xmath103 we now face the problem that ( [ eq : force ] ) is an implicit equation for @xmath100 , which depends on @xmath30 , which in turn depends via @xmath32 on @xmath104 . 
 we therefore use a two - step euler scheme : as initial values for @xmath6 and @xmath23 , we choose the prestressing force , @xmath105 , and the steady - state value under the prestressing force , @xmath106 , respectively . 
 we then choose a sufficiently small time step @xmath107 and apply the following iterative rule : @xmath108 where @xmath109 . 
 in the limit @xmath110 , this procedure converges to the exact solution .

"ime - domain simulation is an important approach for power system dynamic analysis . 
 however , the complete system model , or interchangeably the long - term stability model , typically includes different components where each component requires several differential and algebraic equations ( dae ) to represent , at the same time , these dynamics involve different time scales from millisecond to minute . as a result 
 , the total number of dae of a real power system can be formidably large and complex such that time domain simulation over long time intervals is expensive@xcite . 
 these constraints are even more stringent in the context of on - line stability assessment . 
 intense efforts have been made to accelerate the simulation of long - term stability model . 
 one approach is to use a larger time step size to filter out the fast dynamics or use automatic adjustment of step size according to system behavior in time - domain simulation @xcite@xcite@xcite from the aspect of numerical method . 
 another approach is to implement the quasi steady - state ( qss ) model in long - term stability analysis @xcite@xcite from the aspect of model approximation . 
 nevertheless , the qss model suffers from numerical difficulties when the model gets close to singularities which were addressed in @xcite-@xcite . 
 moreover , the qss model can not provide correct approximations of the long - term stability model consistently as numerical examples shown in @xcite@xcite . 
 in addition , sufficient conditions of the qss model were developed in @xcite which pointed to a direction to improve the qss model . as a result 
 , the qss model requires improvements in both model development and numerical implementation . 
 this paper contributes to the latter one . in this paper 
 , we apply pseudo - transient continuation ( @xmath0 ) which is a theoretical - based numerical method in power system long - term stability analysis . 
 pseudo - transient continuation method can be implemented directly in the long - term stability model to accelerate simulation speed compared with conventional implicit integration method . on the other hand 
 , the method can also be applied in the qss model to overcome possible numerical difficulties due to good stability property . 
 this paper is organized as follows . 
 section [ sectiondyptc ] briefly reviews general pseudo - transient continuation method in dae system . 
 section [ sectionptcinpowersystem ] includes a introduction about power system models followed by implementation of pseudo - transient continuation method in the long - term stability model and the qss model respectively . 
 section [ sectionnumerical ] presents three numerical examples to show the feasibility of the method . and 
 conclusions are stated in section [ sectionconclusion ] . 
 pseudo - transient continuation is a physically - motivated method and can be used in temporal integration . 
 the method follows the solution of dynamical system accurately in early stages until the steady state is approaching . 
 the time step is thereafter increased by sacrificing temporal accuracy to gain rapid convergence to steady state @xcite . 
 if only the steady state of a dynamical system instead of intermediate trajectories is of interest , pseudo - transient continuation method is a better choice than accurate step - by - step integration . on the other hand , 
 compared with methods that solve nonlinear equations for steady state such as line - search and trust region methods , pseudo - transient continuation method can avoid converging to nonphysical solutions or stagnating when the jacobian matrix is singular . 
 this is particularly the case when the system has complex features such as discontinuities which exist in power system models . 
 therefore , @xmath0 method can be regarded as a middle ground between integrating accurately and calculating the steady state directly . 
 @xmath0 method can help reach the steady state quickly while maintain good accuracy for the intermittent trajectories . 
 for ode dynamics , sufficient conditions for convergence of @xmath0 were given in @xcite . 
 the results were further extended the semi - explicit index - one dae system in @xcite . 
 we recall the basic algorithm here . 
 we consider the following semi - explicit index - one dae system : @xmath1 with initial value @xmath2 . here 
 @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5^t \in \re^{n_1+n_2}$ ] , and @xmath6 where @xmath7 is a nonsingular scaling matrix . 
 we assume the initial condition for ( [ dae ] ) is consistent , i.e. @xmath8 and seek to find the equilibrium point @xmath9 such that @xmath10 and satisfies @xmath11 .    as stated before , the step - by - step integration is too time consuming if the intermediate states are not of interest . on the other hand , 
 newton s method for @xmath12 alone usually fails as the initial condition is not sufficiently near the equilibrium point . 
 the @xmath0 procedure is defined by the iteration : @xmath13 where @xmath14 is adjusted to efficiently find @xmath9 rather than to enforce temporal accuracy . 
 the convergence results in @xcite@xcite assume that the time step is updated with `` switched evolution relaxation''(ser ) : @xmath15    the algorithm is shown as below :    set @xmath16 and @xmath17 . 
 evaluate @xmath18 .    while @xmath19 is too large . 
 solve @xmath20 . 
 set @xmath21 . 
 evaluate @xmath18 . 
 update @xmath22 according to ( [ delta ] ) . 
 step 2.a is a newton step which is typically solved by an iterative method which terminates on small linear residuals while it may also be solved by inexact newton iteration . 
 note that the failure of @xmath0 usually can be well signaled by reaching the bound on the total number of iterations @xcite . 
 the convergence of @xmath0 for smooth @xmath23 was proved in @xcite under the assumptions that the dae has index one in a certain uniform sense , that it has a global solution in time , and that the solution converges to a steady state . 
 the result were further extended to nonsmooth @xmath23 in @xcite with @xmath24 in ( [ ptc ] ) replaced by a generalized derivative . 
 next we explain why @xmath0 has a better stability property . 
 firstly , conventional integration methods insist on a small norm of the linear residual at each step and will either converge , diverge to infinity , or stagnate at a point where iteration matrix is singular . 
 however , @xmath0 method will accept an increase in the residual , responding to that increase by decreasing @xmath22@xcite . 
 in addition , @xmath0 stems from backward euler method which is an attractive choice when stability is the desired property instead of accuracy . 
 one may think of @xmath0 method as a predictor - corrector method where the simple predictor is from previous time step and the corrector is backward euler with newton iteration @xcite . to see this , consider the implicit euler step from @xmath25 with @xmath26 , @xmath27 thus , @xmath28 is the root of the following equation : @xmath29 the newton s method to find the root of the above equation is : @xmath30 if we take @xmath31 , then by binomial inverse theorem , the first newton iterate is : @xmath32 which is exactly @xmath0 step . 
 as @xmath0 method has a better stability property , it can be applied in the qss model when conventional integration method fails to converge . 
 in this section , we firstly introduce power system models in long - term stability analysis . 
 then we apply @xmath0 method to the long - term stability model with modifications . 
 finally , we present an algorithm of @xmath0 method in the qss model to overcome possible numerical difficulties .      the long - term stability model for calculating system dynamic response relative to a disturbance can be described as : @xmath33    equation ( [ algebraic eqn ] ) describes the transmission system and the internal static behaviors of passive devices , and ( [ fast ode ] ) describes the internal dynamics of devices such as generators , their associated control systems , certain loads , and other dynamically modeled components . @xmath34 and @xmath35 are continuous functions , and vector @xmath36 and @xmath37 are the corresponding short - term state variables and algebraic variables . besides , equations ( [ slow ode ] ) and ( [ slow dde ] ) describe long - term dynamics including exponential recovery load , turbine governor , load tap changer ( ltc ) , over excitation limiter ( oxl ) , etc . @xmath38 and @xmath39 are the continuous and discrete long - term state variables respectively , and @xmath40 is the maximum time constant among devices . 
 note that shunt compensation switching and ltc operation are typical discrete events captured by ( [ slow dde ] ) and @xmath41 is shunt susceptance and the transformer ratio correspondingly . 
 transitions of @xmath41 depend on system variables , thus @xmath41 change values from @xmath42 to @xmath43 at distinct times @xmath44 where @xmath45 , otherwise , these variables remain constants . since short - term dynamics have much smaller time constants compared with those of long - term dynamics , @xmath46 and @xmath41 are also termed as slow state variables , and @xmath47 are termed as fast state variables .    if we represent the long - term stability model and the qss model in @xmath48 time scale , where @xmath49 , and we denote @xmath50 as @xmath51 , then the long - term stability model of power system can be represented as : @xmath52 where the study region @xmath53 , and @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 .    at the same time , the qss model can be represented as : @xmath58 moreover , the long - term stability model ( [ complete ] ) can be regarded as two decoupled systems ( [ couple1 ] ) and ( [ couple2 ] ) showed as below when @xmath41 jump from @xmath42 to @xmath43 : @xmath59 and @xmath60 discrete variables @xmath41 are updated first and then system ( [ couple2 ] ) works with fixed parameters @xmath41 . 
 similarly , when @xmath41 jump from @xmath42 to @xmath43 , the qss model ( [ qss ] ) can be decoupled as : @xmath61 and @xmath62      assuming @xmath63 is nonsingular , then the long - term stability model ( [ couple2 ] ) with @xmath41 fixed as parameters is a semi - explicit index-1 dae system . 
 @xmath0 method requires initial condition to satisfy the algebraic equations , however , the discrete equation ( [ couple1 ] ) will violate this condition whenever it works . as a result 
 , we need to modify the original @xmath0 method for its implementation in long - term stability model . 
 in power system long - term stability model , @xmath64^t$ ] , @xmath65^t\in\re^{p+m+n}$ ] , @xmath66 , where @xmath67 is the identiy matrix of size @xmath68 . in order to make the initial condition of @xmath0 consistent , we switch back to implicit integration method whenever discrete variables jump and set the step length to be @xmath69 . 
 moreover , @xmath0 method is implemented for the post - fault system starting from @xmath70several seconds after the contingency . in examples of this paper 
 , @xmath70 was set to be @xmath71 . 
 the proposed algorithm is shown as below . 
 run the long - term stability model up to @xmath70 by implicit integration method . 
 set the value @xmath72 at @xmath70 as the initial condition @xmath73 of @xmath0 , and set @xmath17 .    while @xmath74 is too large . 
 if discrete variables jump at @xmath44    update @xmath41 according to ( [ couple1 ] ) . 
 set @xmath75 , @xmath17 . 
 solve the newton step @xmath76 . 
 set @xmath77 .

 otherwise    set @xmath79 . 
 solve the newton step @xmath80 . 
 set @xmath77 . 
 evaluate @xmath78 . 
 update @xmath22 according to ( [ delta ] ) . 
 note that @xmath81 and @xmath82 depend on the specific integration method used . 
 for instance , if implicit trapezoidal method is used , then @xmath83 @xmath84      assuming @xmath85 is nonsingular , then the qss model ( [ coupleqss2 ] ) with @xmath41 fixed as parameters is a semi - explicit index-1 dae system . 
 @xmath0 method requires initial condition to satisfy the algebraic equations , however , the discrete equation ( [ coupleqss1 ] ) will violate this condition whenever it works . as a result 
 , we need to modify the original @xmath0 method for its implementation in the qss model .    in the qss model , 
 @xmath64^t$ ] , @xmath65^t\in\re^{p+m+n}$ ] , @xmath86 , where @xmath67 is the identity matrix of size @xmath87 . 
 in order to make the initial condition of @xmath0 consistent , we switch back to implicit integration method whenever discrete variables jump and set the step length to be @xmath69 . besides , the qss model is implemented at @xmath88when short - term dynamics settle down after the contingency . 
 usually , @xmath88 can be set as 30s . 
 the proposed algorithm is shown as below . 
 run the long - term stability model up to @xmath88 by implicit integration method . set the value @xmath72 at @xmath88 as the initial condition @xmath73 of the qss model , and set @xmath17 . 
 start to run the qss model . 
 if the qss model has a numerical difficulty by using implicit integration method , then go to step 3 , otherwise , continue with the qss model .    while @xmath74 is too large . 
 if discrete variables jump at @xmath44    update @xmath41 according to ( [ coupleqss1 ] ) . 
 set @xmath75 , @xmath17 . 
 solve the newton step @xmath76 . 
 set @xmath77 .

 otherwise    set @xmath79 . 
 solve the newton step @xmath80 . 
 set @xmath77 . 
 evaluate @xmath78 . 
 update @xmath22 according to ( [ delta ] ) .    similarly , @xmath81 and @xmath82 depend on the specific integration method used . 
 if implicit trapezoidal method is used , then @xmath89 @xmath90 
 in this section , three examples are to be presented . 
 the first two examples were the same 145-bus system in which the qss model met numerical difficulties during simulation while the long - term stability model was stable in long - term time scale . 
 firstly , @xmath0 method was implemented in the long - term stability model and the speed was more than 7 times faster than the trapezoidal method . secondly , 
 when the qss model by trapezoidal method met difficulty , @xmath0 method was implemented in the qss model and provided correct approximations and the speed was still more than 5 times faster than the long - term stability model by trapezoidal method . and in the last example which was a 14-bus system , the long - term stability model was unstable and @xmath0 method successfully captured the instability which was signaled by reaching the bound of maximum iteration in the newton step . 
 all simulations were done in psat-2.1.6@xcite . 
 the system was a 145-bus system @xcite . 
 there were exciters and power system stabilizers for each of generator 1 - 20 . 
 and there were turbine governors for each of generator 30 - 40 . 
 besides , there were three load tap changers at lines between bus 73 - 74 , bus 73 - 81 and bus 90 - 92 respectively . 
 the contingency was a line loss between bus 1 - 6 . in this case , the post - fault system was stable after the contingency in the long - term time scale and it took 122.39s for the time domain simulation of the long - term stability model by implicit trapezoidal method . 
 however , @xmath0 method only took 16.12s for the simulation of the long - term stability model which was about @xmath91 of the time consumed by trapezoidal method . 
 [ tdsptc ] shows that the trajectories by @xmath0 method followed closely to the trajectories by trapezoidal method , and finally both converged to the same long - term stable equilibrium point . 
 thus @xmath0 method provided correct approximations for the long - term stability model in terms of trajectories and stability assessment .     method .

 [ tdsptcqss ] shows that the trajectories by @xmath0 method converged to the long - term stable equilibrium point which the long - term stability model converged to , and also provided good accuracy for the intermittent trajectories .

 the system was modified based on the 14-bus test system in psat-2.1.6@xcite . 
 there were three exponential recovery loads at bus 9 , 10 and 14 respectively and two turbine governors at generator 1 and 3 .

 the system suffered from long - term instabilities and simulation by implicit trapezoidal method could not continue after 101.22s . 
 @xmath0 method also stopped at 103.34s when the bound on the total number of iterations for the newton step was reached .

"permutations of the integers @xmath5 = \{1,\ldots , n\}$ ] are a basic building block for the succinct encoding of integer functions  @xcite , strings  @xcite , and binary relations  @xcite , among others . 
 a permutation @xmath0 is trivially representable in @xmath6 bits , which is within @xmath7 bits of the information theory lower bound of @xmath8 bits . and @xmath9=\{1,\ldots , x\}$ ] . ] in many interesting applications , efficient computation of both the permutation @xmath2 and its inverse @xmath3 
 is required . 
 the lower bound of @xmath8 bits yields a lower bound of @xmath10 comparisons to sort such a permutation in the comparison model . yet , a large body of research has been dedicated to finding better sorting algorithms which can take advantage of specificities of each permutation to sort . 
 trivial examples are permutations sorted such as the identity , or containing sorted blocks  @xcite ( e.g. @xmath11 or @xmath12 ) , or containing sorted subsequences  @xcite ( e.g. @xmath13 ) : algorithms performing only @xmath7 comparisons on such permutations , yet still @xmath14 comparisons in the worst case , are achievable and obviously preferable . 
 less trivial examples are classes of permutations whose structure makes them interesting for applications : see mannila s seminal paper  @xcite and estivil - castro and wood s review  @xcite for more details . 
 each sorting algorithm in the comparison model yields an encoding scheme for permutations : it suffices to note the result of each comparison performed to uniquely identify the permutation sorted , and hence to encode it . since an adaptive sorting algorithm performs @xmath15 comparisons on many classes of permutations , each adaptive algorithm yields a _ compression scheme _ for permutations , at the cost of losing a constant factor on some other `` bad '' classes of permutations . 
 we show in section  [ sec : applications ] some examples of applications where only `` easy '' permutations arise . yet 
 such compression schemes do not necessarily support in reasonable time the inverse of the permutation , or even the simple application of the permutation : this is the topic of our study . 
 we describe several encodings of permutations so that on interesting classes of instances the encoding uses @xmath15 bits while supporting the operations @xmath2 and @xmath3 in time @xmath16 . 
 later , we apply our compression schemes to various scenarios , such as the encoding of integer functions , text indexes , and others , yielding original compression schemes for these abstract data types . 
 the _ entropy _ of a sequence of positive integers @xmath17 adding up to @xmath1 is @xmath18 . by convexity of the logarithm , @xmath19 . 
 [ def : entrop ]    [ [ sec : sequences ] ] * succinct encodings of sequences * + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    let @xmath20 $ ] be a sequence over an alphabet @xmath21 $ ] . 
 this includes bitmaps when @xmath22 ( where , for convenience , the alphabet will be @xmath23 ) . 
 we will make use of succinct representations of @xmath24 that support operations @xmath25 and @xmath26 : @xmath27 gives the number of occurrences of @xmath28 in @xmath29 $ ] and @xmath30 gives the position in @xmath24 of the @xmath31th occurrence of @xmath28 .    for the case 
 @xmath22 , @xmath24 requires @xmath1 bits of space and @xmath25 and @xmath26 can be supported in constant time using @xmath32 bits on top of @xmath24 @xcite . 
 the extra space is more precisely @xmath33 for some parameter @xmath34 , which is chosen to be , say , @xmath35 to achieve the given bounds . in this paper 
 , we will sometimes apply the technique over sequences of length @xmath36 ( @xmath1 will be the length of the permutations ) . 
 still , we will maintain the value of @xmath34 as a function of @xmath1 , not @xmath37 , which ensures that the extra space will be of the form @xmath38 , i.e. , it will tend to zero when divided by @xmath37 as @xmath1 grows , even if @xmath37 stays constant . 
 all of our @xmath39 terms involving several variables in this paper can be interpreted in this strong sense : asymptotic in @xmath1 . 
 thus we will write the above space simply as @xmath40 . 
 raman _ et al . _ 
 @xcite devised a bitmap representation that takes @xmath41 bits , while maintaining the constant time for the operations . here 
 @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is the number of occurrences of symbol @xmath28 in @xmath24 , is the so - called _ zero - order entropy _ of @xmath24 . for the binary case this simplifies to @xmath44 , where @xmath45 is the number of bits set in @xmath24 . 
 grossi _ et al . _ 
 @xcite extended the result to larger alphabets using the so - called _ wavelet tree _ , which decomposes a sequence into several bitmaps . by representing those bitmaps in plain form , 
 one can represent @xmath24 using @xmath46 bits of space , and answer @xmath47 $ ] , as well as @xmath25 and @xmath26 queries on @xmath24 , in time @xmath48 . 
 by , instead , using raman _ 
 s representation for the bitmaps , one achieves @xmath49 bits of space , and the same times .

 @xcite used multiary wavelet trees to maintain the same compressed space , while improving the times for all the operations to @xmath50 . 
 [ [ sec : meas - disord - perm ] ] * measures of disorder in permutations * + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    various previous studies on the presortedness in sorting considered in particular the following measures of order on an input array to be sorted . among others , 
 mehlhorn  @xcite and guibas  _ et al . _ 
 @xcite considered the number of pairs in the wrong order , knuth  @xcite considered the number of ascending substrings ( runs ) , cook and kim  @xcite , and later mannila  @xcite considered the number of elements which have to be removed to leave a sorted list , mannila  @xcite considered the smallest number of exchanges of arbitrary elements needed to bring the input into ascending order , skiena  @xcite considered the number of encroaching sequences , obtained by distributing the input elements into sorted sequences built by additions to both ends , and levcopoulos and petersson  @xcite considered shuffled upsequences and shuffled monotone sequences . 
 estivil - castro and wood  @xcite list them all and some others . 
 we first introduce a compression method that takes advantage of ( ascending ) runs in the permutation . then we consider a stricter variant of the runs , which allows for further compression in applications when those runs arise , and in particular allows the representation size to be sublinear in @xmath1 . 
 next , we consider a more general type of runs , which need not be contiguous . 
 one of the best known sorting algorithm is merge sort , based on a simple linear procedure to merge two already sorted arrays , resulting in a worst case complexity of @xmath14 . yet , checking in linear time for _ down - step _ positions in the array , where an element is followed by a smaller one , partitions the original arrays into ascending runs which are already sorted . 
 this can speed up the algorithm when the array is partially sorted  @xcite . 
 we use this same observation to encode permutations . 
 a _ down step _ of a permutation @xmath0 over @xmath5 $ ] is a position @xmath51 such that @xmath52 . 
 a _ run _ in a permutation @xmath0 is a maximal range of consecutive positions @xmath53 which does not contain any down step . let @xmath54 be the list of consecutive down steps in @xmath0 . 
 then the number of runs of @xmath0 is noted @xmath55 , and the sequence of the lengths of the runs is noted @xmath56 . 
 for example , permutation @xmath11 contains @xmath57 runs , of lengths @xmath58 . whereas previous analyses  @xcite of adaptive sorting algorithms considered only the number @xmath59 of runs , we refine them to consider the distribution @xmath60 of the sizes of the runs . 
 there is an encoding scheme using at most @xmath61 bits to encode a permutation @xmath0 over @xmath5 $ ] covered by @xmath59 runs of lengths @xmath60 . 
 it supports @xmath2 and @xmath3 in time @xmath62 for any value of @xmath63 $ ] . 
 if @xmath51 is chosen uniformly at random in @xmath5 $ ] then the average time is @xmath64 . 
 [ thm : main ]    the hu - tucker algorithm @xcite ( see also knuth @xcite ) produces in @xmath65 time a prefix - free code from a sequence of frequencies @xmath66 adding up to @xmath1 , so that ( 1 ) the @xmath51-th lexicographically smallest code is that for frequency @xmath67 , and ( 2 ) 
 if @xmath68 is the bit length of the code assigned to the @xmath51-th sequence element , then @xmath69 is minimal and moreover @xmath70 ( * ? ? ? 
 * , eq .  ( 27 ) ) . 
 we first determine @xmath60 in @xmath7 time , and then apply the hu - tucker algorithm to @xmath60 . 
 we arrange the set of codes produced in a binary trie ( equivalent to a huffman tree @xcite ) , where each leaf corresponds to a run and points to its two endpoints in @xmath0 . because of property ( 1 ) , reading the leaves left - to - right yields the runs also in left - to - right order . 
 now we convert this trie into a wavelet - tree - like structure @xcite without altering its shape , as follows . starting from the root , first process 
 recursively each child . for the leaves 
 do nothing . 
 once both children of an internal node have been processed , the invariant is that they point to the contiguous area in @xmath0 covering all their leaves , and that this area of @xmath0 has already been sorted . 
 now we merge the areas of the two children in time proportional to the new area created ( which , again , is contiguous in @xmath0 because of property ( 1 ) ) . as we do the merging , each time we take an element from the left child we append a 0 bit to a bitmap we create for the node , and a 1 bit when we take an element from the right list . 
 when we finish , we have the following facts : ( 1 ) @xmath0 has been sorted , ( 2 ) the time for sorting has been @xmath71 plus the total number of bits appended to all bitmaps , ( 3 ) each of the @xmath67 elements of leaf @xmath51 ( at depth @xmath68 ) has been merged @xmath68 times , contributing @xmath68 bits to the bitmaps of its ancestors , and thus the total number of bits is @xmath72 . 
 therefore , the total number of bits in the hu - tucker - shaped wavelet tree is at most @xmath73 . to this 
 we must add the @xmath74 bits of the tree pointers . 
 we preprocess all the bitmaps for @xmath25 and @xmath26 queries so as to spend @xmath75 extra bits (  [ sec : sequences ] ) .    to compute @xmath3 we start at offset @xmath51 at the root bitmap @xmath76 , with position @xmath77 , and bitmap size @xmath78 . 
 if @xmath79 = 0 $ ] we go down to the left child with @xmath80 and @xmath81 . 
 otherwise we go down to the right child with @xmath82 , @xmath83 , and @xmath84 . when we reach a leaf , the answer is @xmath85 .    to compute @xmath2 
 we do the reverse process , but we must first determine the leaf @xmath86 and offset @xmath31 within @xmath86 corresponding to position @xmath51 : we start at the root bitmap @xmath76 , with bitmap size @xmath78 and position @xmath87 . if @xmath88 we go down to the left child with @xmath89 . 
 otherwise we go down to the right child with @xmath90 and @xmath91 . 
 we eventually reach leaf @xmath86 , and the offset within @xmath86 is @xmath31 . 
 we now start an upward traversal using the nodes that are already in the recursion stack ( those will be limited to @xmath92 soon ) . 
 if @xmath86 is a left child of its parent @xmath93 , then we set @xmath94 , else we set @xmath95 , where @xmath76 is the bitmap of @xmath93 
 . then we set @xmath96 until reaching the root , where @xmath97 .    in both cases 
 the time is @xmath98 , where @xmath37 is the depth of the leaf arrived at . 
 if @xmath51 is chosen uniformly at random in @xmath5 $ ] , then the average cost is @xmath99 . 
 however , the worst case can be @xmath100 in a fully skewed tree . 
 we can ensure @xmath101 in the worst case while maintaining the average case by slightly rebalancing the hu - tucker tree : if there exist nodes at depth @xmath102 , we rebalance their subtrees , so as to guarantee maximum depth @xmath103 . 
 this affects only marginally the size of the structure . 
 a node at depth @xmath37 can not add up to a frequency higher than @xmath104 ( see next paragraph ) . 
 added over all the possible @xmath59 nodes we have a total frequency of @xmath105 . 
 therefore , by rebalancing those subtrees we add at most @xmath106 bits . 
 this is @xmath107 if @xmath108 , and otherwise the cost was @xmath109 anyway . for the same reasons the average time stays @xmath64 as it increases at most by @xmath110 . 
 the bound on the frequency at depth @xmath37 is proved as follows . 
 consider the node @xmath86 at depth @xmath37 , and its grandparent @xmath93 . 
 then the uncle of @xmath86 can not have smaller frequency than @xmath86 . 
 otherwise we could improve the already optimal hu - tucker tree by executing either a single ( if @xmath86 is left - left or right - right grandchild of @xmath93 ) or double ( if @xmath86 is left - right or right - left grandchild of @xmath93 ) avl - like rotation that decreases the depth of @xmath86 by 1 and increases that of the uncle of @xmath86 by 1 . 
 thus the overall frequency at least doubles whenever we go up two nodes from @xmath86 , and this holds recursively . 
 thus the weight of @xmath86 is at most @xmath111 . 
 the general result of the theorem can be simplified when the distribution @xmath60 is not particularly favorable . 
 there is an encoding scheme using at most @xmath112 bits to encode a permutation @xmath0 over @xmath5 $ ] with a set of @xmath59 runs . 
 it supports @xmath2 and @xmath3 in time @xmath62 for any value of @xmath63 $ ] . 
 [ cor : mainbal ]    as a corollary , we obtain a new proof of a well - known result on adaptive algorithms telling that one can sort in time @xmath113 
 @xcite , now refined to consider the entropy of the partition and not only its size . 
 we can sort an array of length @xmath1 covered by @xmath59 runs of lengths @xmath60 in time @xmath114 , which is worst - case optimal in the comparison model among all permutations with @xmath59 runs of lengths @xmath60 so that @xmath115 . [ cor : mainsort ] 
 some classes of permutations can be covered by a small number of runs of a stricter type . 
 we present an encoding scheme which uses @xmath107 bits for encoding the permutations from those classes , and still @xmath116 bits for all others . 
 a _ strict run _ in a permutation @xmath0 is a maximal range of positions satisfying @xmath117 . 
 the _ head _ of such run is its first position . 
 the number of strict runs of @xmath0 is noted @xmath118 , and the sequence of the lengths of the strict runs is noted @xmath119 . 
 we will call @xmath120 the sequence of run lengths of the sequence formed by the strict run heads of @xmath0 .    for example 
 , permutation @xmath12 contains @xmath121 strict runs , of lengths @xmath122 . 
 the run heads are @xmath123 , and contain 2 runs , of lengths @xmath124 . 
 instead , @xmath11 contains @xmath125 strict runs , all of length 1 . 
 there is an encoding scheme using at most @xmath126 bits to encode a permutation @xmath0 over @xmath5 $ ] covered by @xmath118 strict runs and by @xmath127 runs , and with @xmath120 being the @xmath59 run lengths in the permutation of strict run heads . 
 it supports @xmath2 and @xmath3 in time @xmath62 for any value of @xmath63 $ ] . 
 if @xmath51 is chosen uniformly at random in @xmath5 $ ] then the average time is @xmath128 . 
 [ thm : strict ]    we first set up a bitmap @xmath129 marking with a 1 bit the beginning of the strict runs . 
 set up a second bitmap @xmath130 such that @xmath131 = r[\pi^{-1}(i)]$ ] . 
 now we create a new permutation @xmath132 of @xmath133 $ ] which collapses the strict runs of @xmath0 , @xmath134 . 
 all this takes @xmath7 time and the bitmaps take @xmath135 bits using raman _ 
 s technique , where @xmath25 and @xmath26 are solved in constant time (  [ sec : sequences ] ) . 
 now build the structure of thm . 
 [ thm : main ] for @xmath132 
 . the number of down steps in @xmath0 is the same as for the sequence of strict run heads in @xmath0 , and in turn the same as the down steps in @xmath132 . 
 so the number of runs in @xmath132 is also @xmath59 and their lengths are @xmath120 . 
 thus we get at most @xmath136 bits to encode @xmath132 , and can compute @xmath132 and its inverse in @xmath137 worst case and @xmath128 average time .    to compute @xmath2 , we find @xmath138 and then compute @xmath139 . 
 the final answer is @xmath140 . to compute @xmath3 
 , we find @xmath141 and then compute @xmath142 . 
 the final answer is @xmath143 . 
 this adds only constant time on top of that to compute @xmath132 and its inverse . 
 once again , we might simplify the results when the distribution @xmath120 is not particularly favorable , and we also obtain interesting algorithmic results on sorting . 
 there is an encoding scheme using at most @xmath144 bits to encode a permutation @xmath0 over @xmath5 $ ] covered by @xmath118 strict runs and by @xmath127 runs . 
 it supports @xmath2 and @xmath3 in time @xmath62 for any value of @xmath63 $ ] . 
 [ cor : strictbal ]    we can sort a permutation of @xmath5 $ ] , covered by @xmath118 strict runs and by @xmath59 runs , and @xmath120 being the run lengths of the strict run heads , in time @xmath145 , which is worst - case optimal , in the comparison model , among all permutations sharing these @xmath59 , @xmath118 , and @xmath120 values , such that @xmath146 . 
 [ cor : strictsort ]      levcopoulos and petersson  @xcite introduced the more sophisticated concept of partitions formed by interleaved runs , such as _ shuffled upsequences _ 
 we discuss here the advantage of considering permutations formed by shuffling a small number of runs . 
 a decomposition of a permutation @xmath0 over @xmath5 $ ] into _ shuffled upsequences _ is a set of , not necessarily consecutive , subsequences of increasing numbers that have to be removed from @xmath0 in order to reduce it to the empty sequence . 
 the minimum number of shuffled upsequences in such a decomposition of @xmath0 is noted @xmath147 , and the sequence of the lengths of the involved shuffled upsequences , in arbitrary order , is noted @xmath148 . 
 for example , permutation @xmath13 contains @xmath149 shuffled upsequences of lengths @xmath150 , but @xmath151 runs , all of length 2 . 
 whereas the decomposition of a permutation into runs or strict runs can be computed in linear time , the decomposition into shuffled upsequences requires a bit more time . 
 fredman  @xcite gave an algorithm to compute the size of an optimal partition , claiming a worst case complexity of @xmath14 . 
 in fact his algorithm is adaptive and takes @xmath152 time . 
 we give here a variant of his algorithm which computes the partition itself within the same complexity , and we achieve even better time on favorable sequences @xmath148 . 
 [ lem : partitioninsus ] given a permutation @xmath0 over @xmath5 $ ] covered by @xmath147 shuffled upsequences of lengths @xmath148 , there is an algorithm finding such a partition in time @xmath153 . 
 initialize a sequence @xmath154 , and a splay tree @xmath155 @xcite with the node @xmath156 , ordered by the rightmost value of the sequence contained by each node . for each further element @xmath2 , 
 search for the sequence with the maximum ending point smaller than @xmath2 . if any , add @xmath2 to this sequence , otherwise create a new sequence and add it to @xmath155 . 
 fredman  @xcite already proved that this algorithm computes an optimal partition . 
 the adaptive complexity results from the mere observation that the splay tree ( a simple sorted array in fredman s proof ) contains at most @xmath147 elements , and that the node corresponding to a subsequence is accessed once per element in it . 
 hence the total access time is @xmath153 ( * ? ? ? 
 * thm .  2 ) . 
 the complete description of the permutation requires to encode the computation of both the partitioning algorithm and the sorting one , and this time the encoding cost of partitioning is as important as that of merging .    [ 
 thm : sus ] there is an encoding scheme using at most @xmath157 bits to encode a permutation @xmath0 over @xmath5 $ ] covered by @xmath147 shuffled upsequences of lengths @xmath148 . 
 it supports the operations @xmath2 and @xmath3 in time @xmath158 for any value of @xmath63 $ ] . 
 if @xmath51 is chosen uniformly at random in @xmath5 $ ] the average time is @xmath159 . 
 partition the permutation @xmath0 into @xmath147 shuffled upsequences using lemma  [ lem : partitioninsus ] , resulting in a string @xmath24 of length @xmath1 over alphabet @xmath160 $ ] which indicates for each element of the permutation @xmath0 the label of the upsequence it belongs to . encode @xmath24 with a wavelet tree using raman  _ et al . 
 _ s compression for the bitmaps , so as to achieve @xmath161 bits of space and support retrieval of any @xmath47 $ ] , as well as symbol @xmath25 and @xmath26 on @xmath24 , in time @xmath158 (  [ sec : sequences ] ) . store also an array @xmath162 $ ] so that @xmath163 $ ] is the accumulated length of all the upsequences with label less than @xmath37 . 
 array @xmath164 requires @xmath165 bits . 
 finally , consider the permutation @xmath132 formed by the upsequences taken in label order : @xmath132 has at most @xmath147 runs and hence can be encoded using @xmath166 bits using thm . 
 [ thm : main ] , as @xmath148 in @xmath0 corresponds to @xmath60 in @xmath132 . 
 this supports @xmath167 and @xmath168 in time @xmath158 . 
 now @xmath169+rank_{s[i]}(s , i))$ ] can be computed in time @xmath158 . 
 similarly , @xmath170)$ ] , where @xmath37 is such that @xmath163 < ( \pi')^{-1}(i ) \le a[\ell+1]$ ] , can also be computed in @xmath158 time . 
 thus the whole structure uses @xmath171 bits and supports @xmath2 and @xmath3 in time @xmath158 . 
 the obstacles to achieve the claimed average time are the operations on the wavelet tree of @xmath24 , and the binary search in @xmath164 . 
 the former can be reduced to @xmath172 by using the improved wavelet tree representation by ferragina _ 
 et al . _ 
 (  [ sec : sequences ] ) . 
 the latter is reduced to constant time by representing @xmath164 with a bitmap @xmath173 $ ] with the bits set at the values @xmath163 + 1 $ ] , so that @xmath163 = select_1(a',\ell)-1 $ ] , and the binary search is replaced by @xmath174 . with raman _ 
 _ s structure (  [ sec : sequences ] ) , @xmath175 needs @xmath176 bits and operates in constant time . 
 again , we might prefer a simplified result when @xmath148 has no interesting distribution , and we also achieve an improved result on sorting , better than the known @xmath152 .    [ cor : susbal ]

 consider a full - text inverted index which gives the word positions of any word in a text . 
 this is a popular data structure for natural language text retrieval @xcite , as it permits for example solving phrase queries without accessing the text . for each different text word , 
 an increasing list of its text positions is stored . 
 let @xmath1 be the total number of words in a text collection @xmath179 $ ] and @xmath59 the vocabulary size ( i.e. , number of different words ) . 
 an uncompressed inverted index requires @xmath180 bits . 
 it has been shown @xcite that , by @xmath181-encoding the differences between consecutive entries in the inverted lists , the total space reduces to @xmath182 , where @xmath183 is the zero - order entropy of the text if seen as a sequence of words (  [ sec : sequences ] ) . 
 we note that the empirical law by heaps @xcite , well accepted in information retrieval , establishes that @xmath59 is small : @xmath184 for some constant @xmath185 depending on the text type .    several successful methods to compress natural language text 
 take words as symbols and use zero - order encoding , and thus the size they can achieve is lower bounded by @xmath186 @xcite .

 in addition , we can also obtain a text passage from the ( inverse ) permutation : to find out @xmath191 $ ] , @xmath192 gives its position in the inverted lists , and a binary search on @xmath193 finds the interval @xmath194 
 \le \pi^{-1}(j ) < v[i+1]$ ] , to output that @xmath191 = i$]th word , in @xmath137 time . 
 this result is very interesting , as it constitutes a true word - based _ self - index _ 
 @xcite ( i.e. , a compressed text index that contains the text ) . 
 similar results have been recently obtained with rather different methods @xcite . 
 the cleanest one is to build a wavelet tree over @xmath155 with compression @xcite , which achieves @xmath195 bits of space , and permits obtaining @xmath196 $ ] , as well as extracting the @xmath31th element of the inverted list of the @xmath51th word with @xmath197 , all in time @xmath198 .    yet 
 , one advantage of our approach is that the extraction of @xmath37 consecutive entries @xmath199)$ ] takes @xmath200 time if we do the process for all the entries as a block : start at range @xmath201 $ ] at the root bitmap @xmath76 , with position @xmath77 , and bitmap size @xmath78 . 
 go down to both left and right children : to the left with @xmath201 \leftarrow [ rank_0(b , i),rank_0(b , i')]$ ] , same @xmath202 , and @xmath89 ; to the right with @xmath201 \leftarrow [ rank_1(b , i),rank_1(b , i')]$ ] , @xmath83 , and @xmath91 . 
 stop when the range @xmath201 $ ] becomes empty or when we reach a leaf , in which case report all answers @xmath203 , @xmath204 . by representing the inverted list as @xmath205 
 , we can extract long inverted lists faster than the existing methods . 
 [ cor : invfile ] there exists a representation for a text @xmath179 $ ] of integers in @xmath206 $ ] ( regarded as word identifiers ) , with zero - order entropy @xmath207 , that takes @xmath208 bits of space , and can retrieve the text position of the @xmath31th occurrence of the @xmath51th text word , as well as the value @xmath191 $ ] , in @xmath137 time . 
 it can also retrieve any range of @xmath37 successive occurrences of the @xmath51th text word in time @xmath209 . 
 we could , instead , represent the inverted list as @xmath0 , so as to extract long text passages efficiently , but the wavelet tree representation can achieve the same result . another interesting functionality that both representations share , and which is useful for other list intersection algorithms @xcite , 
 is that to obtain the first entry of a list which is larger than @xmath210 . 
 this is done with @xmath25 and @xmath26 on the wavelet tree representation . in our permutation representation , we can also achieve it in @xmath62 time by finding out the position of a number @xmath210 within a given run . 
 the algorithm is similar to those in thm . 
 [ thm : main ] that descend to a leaf while maintaining the offset within the node , except that the decision on whether to descend left or right depends on the leaf we want to arrive at and not on the bitmap content ( this is actually the algorithm to compute @xmath25 on binary wavelet trees @xcite ) .    finally , we note that our inverted index data structure supports in small time all the operations required to solve conjunctive queries on binary relations . 
 suffix arrays are used to index texts that can not be handled with inverted lists . given a text @xmath179 $ ] of @xmath1 symbols over an alphabet of size @xmath59 , the _ suffix _ array @xmath211 
 $ ] is a permutation of @xmath5 $ ] so that @xmath212,n]$ ] is lexicographically smaller than @xmath213,n]$ ] . as suffix arrays 
 take much space , several compressed data structures have been developed for them @xcite . 
 one of interest for us is the _ compressed suffix array ( csa ) _ of sadakane @xcite . 
 it builds over a permutation @xmath214 of @xmath5 $ ] , which satisfies @xmath215 = ( a[i]~\textrm{mod}~n ) + 1 $ ] ( and thus lets us move virtually one position forward in the text ) @xcite . 
 it turns out that , using just @xmath214 and @xmath74 extra bits , one can @xmath216 _ count _ the number of times a pattern @xmath217 $ ] occurs in @xmath155 using @xmath218 applications of @xmath214 ; @xmath219 _ locate _ any such occurrence using @xmath220 applications of @xmath214 , by spending @xmath221 extra bits of space ; and @xmath222 _ extract _ a text substring @xmath223 $ ] using at most @xmath224 applications of @xmath214 . hence this is another self - index , and its main burden of space is that to represent permutation @xmath214 . 
 sadakane shows that @xmath214 has at most @xmath59 runs , and gives a representation that accesses @xmath225 $ ] in constant time by using @xmath226 bits of space . 
 it was shown later @xcite that the space is actually @xmath227 bits , for any @xmath228 and constant @xmath229 . here 
 @xmath230 is the @xmath231th order empirical entropy of @xmath155 @xcite .    with thm . 
 [ thm : main ] we can encode @xmath214 using @xmath232 bits of space , whose extra terms aside from entropy are better than sadakane s 
 . those extra terms can be very significant in practice . 
 the price is that the time to access @xmath214 is @xmath137 instead of constant . on the other hand , 
 an interesting extra functionality is that to compute @xmath233 , which lets us move ( virtually ) one position backward in @xmath155 . 
 this allows , for example , displaying the text context around an occurrence without having to spend any extra space . 
 still , although interesting , the result is not competitive with recent developments @xcite . 
 an interesting point is that @xmath214 contains @xmath234 strict runs , for any @xmath231 @xcite . 
 therefore , cor . 
 [ cor : strictbal ] lets us represent it using @xmath235 bits of space . for @xmath231 limited as above , 
 this is at most @xmath236 bits , which is similar to the space achieved by another self - index @xcite , yet again it is slightly superseded by its time performance . 
 munro  _ et al . _ 
 @xcite described how to represent a permutation @xmath0 as the concatenation of its cycles , completed by a bitvector of @xmath1 bits coding the lengths of the cycles . 
 as the cycle representation is itself a permutation of @xmath5 $ ] , we can use any of the permutation encodings described in  [ sec : compr - techn ] to encode it , adding the binary vector encoding the lengths of the cycles . 
 it is important to note that , for a specific permutation @xmath0 , the difficulty to compress its cycle encoding @xmath132 is not the same as the difficulty to encode the original permutation @xmath0 .    given a permutation @xmath0 with @xmath28 cycles of lengths @xmath237 , there are several ways to encode it as a permutation @xmath132 , depending on the starting point of each cycle ( @xmath238 } n_i$ ] choices ) and the order of the cycles in the encoding ( @xmath239 choices ) . as a consequence , each permutation @xmath0 with @xmath28 cycles of lengths @xmath237 
 can be encoded by any of the @xmath238 } i\times n_i$ ] corresponding permutations . 
 any of the encodings from theorems  [ thm : main ] , [ thm : strict ] and  [ thm : sus ] can be combined with an additional cost of at most @xmath240 bits to encode a permutation @xmath0 over @xmath5 $ ] composed of @xmath28 cycles of lengths @xmath237 to support the operation @xmath4 for any value of @xmath241 , in time and space function of the order in the permutation encoding of the cycles of @xmath0 . 
 the space `` wasted '' by such a permutation representation of the cycles of @xmath0 is @xmath242 bits . to recover some of this space , 
 one can define a canonical cycle encoding by starting the encoding of each cycle with its smallest value , and by ordering the cycles in order of their starting point . 
 this canonical encoding always starts with a @xmath243 and creates at least one shuffled upsequence of length @xmath28 : it can be compressed as a permutation over @xmath244 $ ] with at least one shuffled upsequence of length @xmath245 through thm  [ thm : sus ] . 
 munro and rao  @xcite extended the results on permutations to arbitrary functions from @xmath5 $ ] to @xmath5 $ ] , and to their iterated application @xmath246 , the function iterated @xmath231 times starting at @xmath51 . 
 their encoding is based on the decomposition of the function into a bijective part , represented as a permutation , and an injective part , represented as a forest of trees whose roots are elements of the permutation : the summary of the concept is that an integer function is just a `` hairy permutation '' . combining the representation of permutations from @xcite with any representation of trees supporting the level - ancestor operator and an iterator of the descendants at a given level yields a representation of an integer function @xmath247 using @xmath248 bits to support @xmath246 in @xmath249 time , for any fixed @xmath250 , integer @xmath241 and @xmath63 $ ] . 
 janssen  _ et al . _ 
 @xcite defined the _ degree entropy _ of an ordered tree @xmath155 with @xmath1 nodes , having @xmath67 nodes with @xmath51 children , as @xmath251 , and proposed a succinct data structure for @xmath155 using @xmath252 bits to encode the tree and support , among others , the level - ancestor operator . 
 obviously , the definition and encoding can be generalized to a forest of @xmath231 trees by simply adding one node whose @xmath231 children are the roots of the @xmath231 trees .    encoding the injective parts of the function using janssen  _ et al . _ 
 @xcite succinct encoding , and the bijective parts of the function using one of our permutation encodings , yields a compressed representation of any integer function which supports its application and the application of its iterated variants in small time . 
 [ cor : fun ] there is a representation of a function @xmath253\rightarrow[n]$ ] that uses @xmath254 bits to support @xmath246 in @xmath255 time , for any integer @xmath231 and for any @xmath63 $ ] , where @xmath155 is the forest representing the injective part of the function , and @xmath59 is the number of runs in the bijective part of the function . 
 bentley and yao  @xcite , when introducing a family of search algorithms adaptive to the position of the element searched ( aka the `` unbounded search '' problem ) , did so through the definition of a family of adaptive codes for unbounded integers , hence proving that the link between algorithms and encodings was not limited to the complexity lower bounds suggested by information theory .    in this paper 
 , we have considered the relation between the difficulty measures of adaptive sorting algorithms and some measures of `` entropy '' for compression techniques on permutations . in particular , we have shown that some concepts originally defined for adaptive sorting algorithms , such as runs and shuffled upsequences , are useful in terms of the compression of permutations ; and conversely , that concepts originally defined for data compression , such as the entropy of the sets of sizes of runs , are a useful addition to the set of difficulty measures that one can consider in the study of adaptive algorithms . 
 it is easy to generalize our results on runs and strict runs to take advantage of permutations which are a mix of up and down runs or strict runs ( e.g. @xmath256 , with only a linear extra computational and/or space cost . 
 the generalization of our results on shuffled upsequences to sms  @xcite , permutations containing mixes of subsequences sorted in increasing and decreasing orders ( e.g. @xmath257 ) is sligthly more problematic , because it is np hard to optimally decompose a permutation into such subsequences  @xcite , but any approximation scheme  @xcite would yield a good encoding .

"white dwarf ( wd ) stars represent the end points of stellar evolution for all low - mass stars , and are the fate of more than 97% of all stars in our galaxy . 
 roughly 80% of wds belong to the spectral class da , with atmospheres characteristically dominated by hydrogen @xcite . when da wds cool to the appropriate temperature to foster a hydrogen partial ionization zone , they begin their journey through the zz ceti ( or dav ) instability strip , where global pulsations are driven to observable amplitudes and their fundamental parameters can be determined using asteroseismology ( see reviews by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ) .    aside from their variability , the zz ceti stars discovered to date appear to be otherwise normal wds , and are therefore believed to be a natural phase in the evolution of all das . although some das within the empirical instability strip have been observed not to vary to modest limits ( e.g. , @xcite ) , follow - up observations have shown that some of these stars really do pulsate at low amplitude ( e.g. , @xcite ) . 
 higher - quality optical and uv spectra have also moved some of these non - variable interlopers out of the instability strip @xcite . 
 thus , it is currently believed that the zz ceti instability strip is pure , and that all da wds will at some point pass through it and pulsate @xcite . 
 much work has been devoted to observationally mapping the zz ceti instability strip , which runs in temperature from roughly @xmath11 k for standard @xmath4  = 8.0 wds @xcite . 
 there is also a dependence on surface gravity , such that wds with lower @xmath4  pulsate at lower effective temperatures . 
 this trend has been observed for wds with masses from 1.1 @xmath1  down to 0.5 @xmath1  @xcite . 
 the blue edge of the zz ceti instability strip , where pulsations are turning on , has been successfully estimated by both convective period arguments @xcite and full non - adiabatic calculations @xcite . 
 a slightly more efficient prescription for convection has to be assumed , by increasing the value of the mixing - length theory parameter ml2/@xmath12 , to make the theory match the observed blue edge , which was most recently mapped empirically by @xcite . 
 however , estimating the temperature at which pulsations should shut down has remained a challenge . 
 modern non - adiabatic calculations do not predict a red edge until around 5600 k @xcite , more than 5000 k cooler than the empirical red edge @xcite . 
 @xcite argue that a surface reflection criterion can be enforced to limit the maximum mode period , which may push a theoretical red edge to hotter temperatures , nearer what is observed in zz ceti stars @xcite . 
 the recent discovery of pulsating extremely low - mass ( elm , @xmath13 0.25 @xmath1 ) wds provides us with an exciting new opportunity to explore the nature of the physics of wd pulsations at cooler temperatures and much lower masses . since the first discovery by @xcite , more than 160 zz ceti stars have been found , all of which have masses @xmath14 0.5 @xmath1  and thus likely harbor carbon - oxygen ( co ) cores . that changed with the discovery of the first three pulsating elm wds @xcite . 
 these elm wds are likely the product of binary evolution , since the galaxy is not old enough to produce such low - mass wds through single - star evolution @xcite . during a common - envelope phase , 
 the elm wds were most likely stripped of enough mass to prevent helium ignition , suggesting they harbor he cores . 
 the pulsating elm wds will be incredibly useful in constraining the interior composition , hydrogen - layer mass , overall mass , rotation rate , and the behavior of convection in these low - mass wds , which may derive a majority of their luminosities from stable hydrogen burning for the lowest - mass objects @xcite . 
 several groups have recently investigated the pulsation properties of he - core wds , and non - adiabatic calculations have shown that non - radial @xmath15- and @xmath10-modes should be unstable and thus observable in these objects @xcite . 
 pulsating elm wds will also extend our empirical studies of the zz ceti instability strip to significantly lower surface gravities .    boosted by the many new elm wds catalogued by the elm survey , a targeted spectroscopic search for elm wds @xcite , we have looked for additional pulsating elm wds throughout a large part of parameter space . 
 the first three pulsating elm wds all have effective temperatures below @xmath16 k , much cooler than any previously known co - core zz ceti star @xcite , which makes up the coolest class of pulsating wds . 
 we now add to that list the two coolest pulsating wds ever found , sdss  j161431.28 + 191219.4 ( @xmath17 mag , hereafter j1614 ) and sdss  j222859.93 + 362359.6 ( @xmath18 mag , hereafter j2228 ) , bringing to five the number of elm wds known to pulsate . 
 in section  [ sec : j1614 ] we detail our discovery of pulsations in j1614 and outline our new spectroscopic observations of this elm wd . in section  [ sec : j2228 ] 
 we describe the discovery of multi - periodic variability in the elm wd j2228 and update its determined atmospheric parameters . 
 we conclude with a discussion of these discoveries , and update the observed da wd instability strip . 
 @xcite found that j1614 had @xmath2  @xmath19 k and @xmath4  @xmath20 , based on a single spectrum of this @xmath17 mag wd from the flwo 1.5 m telescope using the fast spectrograph @xcite . 
 we have obtained an additional 51 spectra using the same instrument and setup . 
 we have co - added our spectroscopic observations to determine the atmospheric parameters of the elm wd j1614 ( figure  [ fig : j1614spec ] ) . 
 our observations cover a wavelength range from @xmath21  . 
 the model atmospheres used for this analysis are described at length in @xcite and employ the new stark broadening profiles from @xcite . 
 models where convective energy transport becomes important are computed using the ml2/@xmath12 = 0.8 prescription of the mixing - length theory ( see * ? ? ? 
 a discussion of our extension of these models to lower surface gravities and more details of our fitting method can be found in section 2.1.1 of @xcite . 
 our final fit to the phased and co - added spectrum of j1614 is shown in the top panel of figure  [ fig : j1614spec ] and yields @xmath2  @xmath3 k and @xmath4  @xmath5 . 
 this corresponds to a mass of @xmath60.20 @xmath1  using the he - core wd models of @xcite , if we assume the wd is in its final cooling stage . 
 the more recent models of @xcite predict a mass of 0.19 @xmath1  given the atmospheric parameters , which we adopt . 
 we have also performed our fit without using the low s / n lines h11@xmath22h12 , but this marginally affects our solution : using only the h@xmath23@xmath22h10 lines of the balmer series , we find @xmath2  @xmath24 k and @xmath4  @xmath25 . to remain consistent with our previous pulsating elm wd atmospheric determinations @xcite , we will include the h11@xmath22h12 lines in our adopted solution for j1614 .

 scatter gives us an upper limit on the rv semi - amplitude : @xmath26 km s@xmath27 . 
 the systemic velocity is @xmath28 km s@xmath27 . 
 we note that this non - detection does not require the lack of a companion to the elm wd in j1614 . 
 rather , the system may be inclined nearly face - on to our line of sight , or the companion may be a much cooler low - mass wd 
 . if the inclination is @xmath29 , which is more than 85% likely if the orientation of the system with respect to the earth is drawn from a random distribution , the companion has @xmath30 @xmath1  if the system has a 7 hr orbital period , the median for elm wd binaries in the elm survey @xcite . empirically , there are similarly low - mass wds in the elm survey with no significant radial velocity variability @xcite . 
 we obtained high - speed photometric observations of j1614 at the mcdonald observatory over five consecutive nights in 2012  june for a total of nearly 15.4 hr of coverage . 
 we used the argos instrument , a frame - transfer ccd mounted at the prime focus of the 2.1 m otto struve telescope @xcite , to obtain @xmath31 s exposures on j1614 . 
 a full journal of observations can be found in table  [ tab : jour ] . 
 observations were obtained through a 3 mm bg40 filter to reduce sky noise . 
 we performed weighted , circular , aperture photometry on the calibrated frames using the external iraf package @xmath32 written by antonio kanaan @xcite . 
 we divided the sky - subtracted light curves by the brightest comparison star in the field , sdss  j161433.39 + 191058.3 ( @xmath33 mag ) , to correct for transparency variations , and applied a timing correction to each observation to account for the motion of the earth around the barycenter of the solar system @xcite . 
 the top panel of figure  [ fig : j1614 ] shows a portion of a typical light curve for j1614 , obtained on 2012 june 23 , and includes the brightest comparison star in the field over the same period . 
 the bottom panel of this figure shows a fourier transform ( ft ) utilizing all @xmath34 light curve points collected thus far . 
 we display the 4@xmath35 significance line at the bottom of figure  [ fig : j1614 ] , calculated from the average amplitude , @xmath35 , of an ft within a 1000 @xmath36hz  region in steps of 200 @xmath36hz , after pre - whitening by the two highest - amplitude periodicities . 
 .frequency solution for sdss j161431.28 + 191219.4 [ tab : j1614freq ] [ cols=""<,^,^,^,^ "" , ]     we may compare the first five pulsating elm wds to the previously known zz ceti stars by placing them in a @xmath4@xmath2  diagram , shown in figure  [ fig : search ] . 
 doing so , we discover there are at least six elm wds with temperatures and surface gravities between the newfound pulsating elm wd j2228 and the other four known pulsating elm wds . 
 these non - variable elm wds have been observed extensively and do not show significant evidence of pulsations to at least 1% relative amplitude . 
 we have excellent limits on the lack of variability in four of these six , ruling out pulsations larger than 0.3% amplitude . 
 we have put limits on three of these new non - detections , detailed in table  [ tab : null ] . 
 we note that @xcite previously observed psr  1012 + 5307 , but we have put much more stringent limits on a lack of variability on this faint elm wd with 7 hr of observations in excellent conditions . 
 the other three interlopers have been detailed in previous studies . 
 sdss  j0822 + 2753 is a @xmath2  @xmath37 k , @xmath4  @xmath38 wd observed not to vary to 0.2% @xcite . 
 sdss  j1443 + 1509 is a @xmath2  @xmath39 k , @xmath4  @xmath40 wd with exquisite limits on lack of variability , to @xmath41% @xcite . finally , nltt  11748 is the @xmath2  @xmath42 k , @xmath4  @xmath43 primary wd in an eclipsing wd+wd binary @xcite . 
 it was shown by @xcite not to vary out of eclipse to above 0.5% . 
 we have obtained an additional 8 hr of photometry of nltt  11748 out of eclipse at mcdonald observatory and can independently rule out variability larger than 0.3% .    the discovery of pulsations in j2228 , which is considerably cooler than at least a half - dozen other photometrically constant elm wds , questions the purity of the instability strip for he - core wds and confuses the location of an empirical red edge . 
 however , there is no a priori reason to expect the elm wd instability strip to be pure , or for there to exist a connected low - mass extension of the classical co - core zz ceti instability strip ; evolution through a specific temperature - gravity region is not well established for the elm wds , and they may not all cool through the instability strip in as simple a manner as the co - core zz ceti stars . 
 in fact , some of these elm wds may indeed be in the throws of unstable hydrogen shell burning episodes ; they may not be cooling at all , but rather looping through the hr diagram prior to settling on a final cooling track ( e.g. , @xcite ) . 
 such excursions are not expected for co - core zz ceti stars , which are expected to monotonically cool through an observationally pure instability strip . 
 we have plotted the evolution of theoretical cooling tracks for several different wd masses through the effective temperatures and surface gravities in figure  [ fig : search ] . 
 we plot the 0.16 @xmath1 , 0.17 @xmath1 , 0.18 @xmath1 , 0.20 @xmath1 , 0.25 @xmath1 , and 0.35 @xmath1  he - core models of @xcite as dotted magenta lines . 
 we have also used the stellar evolution code mesa @xcite to model the evolution of 0.15 @xmath1 , 0.20 @xmath1 , and 0.25 @xmath1  he - core wds , shown as solid cyan lines in figure  [ fig : search ] . for reference 
 , we have also included 0.6 @xmath1 , 0.8 @xmath1 , and 1.0 @xmath1  co - core cooling tracks @xcite .    where the lowest - mass wd models enter this diagram depends on how we artificially remove mass from the models , and there is a very noticeable discrepancy between the 0.16 @xmath1  @xcite wd models and our 0.15 @xmath1  wd models using mesa . as an added complication , except for the lowest - mass elm wds ( below roughly 0.18 @xmath1 ) , recurrent hydrogen shell flashes cause the elm wd model to loop many times through this @xmath2-@xmath4  plane , further confusing the picture @xcite . 
 thus , it is not entirely surprising to find non - variable elm wds between j2228 and the four warmer pulsating elm wds . 
 further empirical exploration of the entire elm wd instability strip offers a unique opportunity to constrain physical and evolution models of elm wds , specifically these late thermal pulses and the mass boundary for the occurrence of these episodes . 
 long - term monitoring of the rate of period change of pulsating elm wds also affords an opportunity to constrain the cooling ( or heating ) rate of these objects @xcite . 
 in contrast to the confusion along the red edge of the instability strip , the blue edge is more reliably predicted by theory . 
 the theoretical blue edge ( dotted blue line ) in figure  [ fig : search ] has been calculated following @xcite and @xcite . 
 we use the criterion that @xmath44 for the longest period mode that is excited , where @xmath45 is the mode period and the timescale @xmath46 describes the heat capacity of the convection zone as a function of the local photospheric flux , which we compute from a grid of models ( see @xcite for further details ) . 
 we use the criterion @xmath47 s , with the convective prescription ml2/@xmath12=1.5 . 
 we also include the theoretical blue edge of @xcite , which uses a slightly less efficient prescription for convection , ml2/@xmath12=1.0 . 
 we have discovered pulsations in two new extremely low - mass , putatively he - core wds using optical facilities at the mcdonald observatory . 
 spectral fits show that these two elm wds , j1614 and j2228 , are the coolest pulsating wds ever found . 
 this brings to five the total number of pulsating elm wds known , establishing them as a new class of pulsating wd . as with the more than 160 co - core zz ceti stars that have been known for more than four decades , the luminosity variations in these elm wds is so far consistent with surface temperature variations caused by non - radial @xmath10-mode pulsations driven to observability by a hydrogen partial ionization zone . 
 the coolest pulsating elm wd , j2228 , has a considerably lower effective temperature than six similar - gravity elm wds that are photometrically constant to good limits . 
 in contrast to the co - core zz ceti stars , which are believed to represent a stage in the evolution of all such wds , elm wds may not all evolve through an instability strip in the same way , and thus we may not observe their instability strip to be pure . 
 theoretical he - core wd models predict multiple unstable hydrogen - burning episodes , which complicates the evolution of an elm wd through a simple instability strip . empirically discovering elm wds in this space that do or do not pulsate opens the possibility to use the presence of pulsations in elm wds to constrain the 
 binary and stellar evolution models used for low - mass wds , which may better constrain these poorly understood cno - flashing episodes .

 both wds have masses @xmath0 0.25 @xmath1  and thus likely harbor helium cores . 
 spectral fits indicate these are the two coolest pulsating wds ever found . 
 j1614 has @xmath2  @xmath3 k and @xmath4  @xmath5 , which corresponds to a @xmath60.19 @xmath1  wd . 
 j2228 is considerably cooler , with a @xmath2  @xmath7 k and @xmath4  @xmath8 , which corresponds to a @xmath60.16 @xmath1  wd , making it the coolest and lowest - mass pulsating wd known . 
 there are multiple elm wds with effective temperatures between the warmest and coolest known elm pulsators that do not pulsate to observable amplitudes , which questions the purity of the instability strip for low - mass wds . 
 in contrast to the co - core zz ceti stars , which are believed to represent a stage in the evolution of all such wds , elm wds may not all evolve as a simple cooling sequence through an instability strip . both stars 
 exhibit long - period variability ( @xmath9 s ) consistent with non - radial @xmath10-mode pulsations . 
 although elm wds are preferentially found in close binary systems , both j1614 and j2228 do not exhibit significant radial - velocity variability , and are perhaps in low - inclination systems or have low - mass companions . 
 these are the fourth and fifth pulsating elm wds known , all of which have hydrogen - dominated atmospheres , establishing these objects as a new class of pulsating wd .

"the interstellar medium ( ism ) of a typical disk galaxy is divided into variety of distinct phases , generally classified into hot ionized ( @xmath4 ) gas , the warm neutral medium ( wnm ; @xmath5 ) , and the cold neutral medium ( cnm ; @xmath6 ) . 
 star formation , however , appears to be restricted to cold dense gas with a star formation rate ( sfr ) that strongly correlates with the molecular gas content @xcite . 
 this link between star formation and molecular gas is probably not causal , in the sense that the presence of molecules simply marks those parts of the ism that are cold and dense enough to undergo gravitational collapse @xcite , but the molecular gas nonetheless represents an indispensable tracer of star forming regions in the local and distant universe . 
 understanding these crucial links between star formation , the ism , and galaxy evolution , all intricately coupled through a variety of energetic stellar feedback mechanisms , must rely on identifying the pathways and conditions under which cold , molecular gas is able to develop 
 . furthermore , the gas temperature sets the characteristic size ( @xmath7 ) and mass ( @xmath8 ) of prestellar cores that develop in post - shock regions within magnetized , star - forming clouds ( e.g. , * ? ? ? 
 * ; * ? ? ? 
 since gas cooled by rotational transitions of co is able to reach lower temperature than that cooled by fine - structure lines of atomic carbon , tracking molecular chemistry is crucial to accurately represent small - scale fragmentation in numerical simulations of star - forming clouds . 
 young , massive stars are the main source of far - ultraviolet ( fuv ) photons that permeate the ism and readily photodissociate interstellar molecules , such as molecular hydrogen ( @xmath0 ) and carbon monoxide ( co ) . 
 molecular gas is thus found predominantly in dense , cold regions where dust shielding and self - shielding by the molecules themselves have attenuated the interstellar radiation field ( isrf ) intensity far below its mean . 
 the transition zones separating atomic and molecular gas , so called photodissociation regions ( pdrs ) , have been studied extensively both numerically and theoretically ( e.g. , * ? ? ? 
 * ; * ? ? ? 
 * ; * ? ? ? 
 * ; * ? ? ? 
 * ; * ? ? ? 
 * ; * ? ? ? 
 * ; * ? ? ? 
 * ; * ? ? ? 
 * ; * ? ? ? 
 typically , the outer , unshielded layers of a pdr are composed of atomic hydrogen and singly ionized carbon . 
 as column density increases the atomic - to - molecular transition begins to occur , with the c - co transition occurring interior to the @xmath9-@xmath0 one . 
 deeper still , when external fuv photons have been entirely absorbed , the chemistry and thermodynamics becomes dominated by the presence of deep penetrating cosmic rays and the freeze out of molecules onto dust grains . 
 simply understanding the structure of a non - dynamic , one - dimensional pdr is of limited utility . 
 the ism is a dynamic environment where a variety of non - linear , coupled processes determine the global distribution and state of gas . 
 star forming complexes are continually assembled through self - gravity , while stellar feedback acts disperse the structures . 
 turbulent motions , ubiquitous in the ism , dissipate through radiative shocks , but are continually replenished through a combination of supernovae and stellar winds . 
 thermal processes , such as dust grain photoelectric heating and molecular line cooling , further influence the state of the ism and are sensitive functions of ambient radiation fields , column density , and the non - equilibrium chemical state of the gas . 
 implementing these processes in a numerical simulation is highly non - trivial , a challenge further exacerbated by the enormous range of spatial scales involved ; the star forming region of a galactic disk can extend radially for tens of kiloparsecs while individual star forming disks are typically hundreds of aus and smaller , making this a computational _ tour de force _ for even adaptively refined grids . 
 nevertheless , three - dimensional simulations of finite , but representative , portions of galactic disks have attempted to replicate a supernova - driven ism , finding success in reproducing a multiphase ism @xcite , or demonstrating the regulation of the sfr by stellar feedback @xcite . 
 studies that have examined the atomic - to - molecular transition within large - scale , three - dimensional simulations has received far less attention . @xcite and 
 @xcite simulated the conversion of the atomic ism to molecular form in isolated periodic boxes , without explicit feedback but including driven or decaying turbulence . @xcite and @xcite included non - equilibrium @xmath0 formation in simulations of galactic discs , but neglected self - gravity and supernova feedback . 
 these studies did include an @xmath0-dissociating fuv photo - background , though assumed it to be constant in both space and time . 
 @xcite recently conducted a series of galactic scale simulations including supernova feedback , non - equilibrium chemistry , and radiative shielding based on the treecol algorithm @xcite . here 
 , the strength of the fuv photodissociating background scales linearly with the instantaneous sfr , though is spatially uniform . 
 @xcite finds the amount and distribution of molecular gas depends sensitively on a number of parameters , in particular the precise rhythm and spatial distribution of supernovae . 
 while these simulations have provided insight into the relationship between dynamics and chemistry , the price of simulating 3d time - dependent chemistry is that their treatment of photodissociation , the crucial process for regulating the chemical state of the ism , is extremely primitive . 
 the true photodissociation and photoheating rate at any point depends on the flux of fuv radiation integrated over all solid angles and from sources at all distances . 
 in contrast , most of the chemodynamical simulations conducted to date have relied on _ ad hoc _ prescriptions for the dust- and self - shielding - attenuated photodissociation rates in which a single , uniform , permeating radiation field is assumed to exist in all unshielded regions , and the degree of attenuation at a point is characterized by a single characteristic column density . 
 these prescriptions are for the most part untested , and are of unknown accuracy .    here 
 our goal is to perform a detailed study on the chemical state of gas in a self - consistently simulated ism , placing special emphasis on accurately computing the molecular content with an rigorous treatment of the generation and attenuation of photodissociating fuv radiation . 
 we do this by post - processing the supernovae driven galactic disk simulations of @xcite with multifrequency ray tracing and a physically motivated spatial distribution of stellar sources . 
 this approach has the price that it discards time - dependent dynamical effects . 
 however , it does not rely on untested approximations for the radiative transfer problem . 
 it therefore provides a useful complement to the more approximate dynamical simulations that have appeared in the literature thus far . 
 in particular , our approach enables tests to evaluate the accuracy of simplified shielding schemes that have been previously used .    in this paper , 
 our main goal is to compare a number of commonly used local approximations for the degree of radiative shielding to full solutions of the radiative transfer equation , in order to gauge the effect that different approaches to radiative shielding have on the molecular abundances and temperature . for our tests 
 , we use a density structure obtained from large - scale ism simulations with turbulence self - consistently driven by star formation feedback , which naturally includes vertical stratification and strong density contrasts between warm and cold gas phases . 
 we are also able to test how the distribution of molecular complexes is sensitive to parameters such as the stellar distribution and overall fuv intensity , and the relative importance of dust- and self - shielding . 
 our comparison of different shielding prescriptions will advise us as to the validity and best use of local shielding approximations in upcoming multidimensional simulations of star formation that we shall perform . 
 we organize this paper as follows . in section [ sec : method ] we describe our methodology , including a description of the simulation we apply our post - processing to , the details of our chemical network , and the numerical approach to solving the equation of radiative transfer . in section [ sec : results ] we display our results . 
 finally , we discuss our results and conclude in section [ sec : discussion ] . 
 in this paper we apply radiative and chemical post - processing to the large - scale galactic disk simulations of @xcite to compute the equilibrium chemical and thermal state of the disk given a realistic distribution of stellar sources , a self - consistently derived morphological structure , and multi - frequency , long - characteristics radiative transfer . 
 our methodology broadly consists of two parts . 
 first , we perform frequency dependent radiative transfer through the simulation volume , which we describe in detail in section [ sec : raytrace ] , supplying us with the shielding attenuated chemical photorates . next 
 , these photorates are passed to a chemical network , described in section [ sec : chemistry ] , which is then run to equilibrium , on a cell - by - cell basis , to produce a three - dimensional datacube of chemical abundances and , in a subset of our models , gas temperature ( section [ sec : thermal ] ) . in this procedure , the ray trace and chemical network integration are intricately linked via the photodissociation rates . 
 the chemical abundances have an effect on the global photodissociation rates , which in turn determine the chemical abundances . given the non - local coupling between these two steps , chemical network integration and ray tracing must be carried out iteratively until convergence is obtained in the chemical abundances . 
 the simulations of @xcite ( hereafter k15 ) were run with the athena code @xcite which solves the equations of ideal magnetohydrodynamics on a uniform grid . the models also include self- and external - gravity , heating and cooling , thermal conductivity , coriolis forces , and tidal gravity in the shearing box approximation to model the effect of differential galactic rotation . while k15 ran a suite of simulations with a range of magnetic field strengths and configurations , here we focus exclusively on their mb10 ( solar neighborhood analog ) model that has the following initial properties : gas surface density of @xmath10 , midplane density of stars plus dark matter @xmath11 , galactic rotation angular speed @xmath12 , uniform azimuthal magnetic field of @xmath13 , and box size @xmath14 , @xmath15 , where the @xmath16 direction is perpendicular to the disk . 
 the computational box had a uniform resolution of @xmath17 in each direction such that the number of grid cells along each direction were @xmath18 and @xmath19 . 
 gas cooling , dominated by ly@xmath20 emission at high temperatures and @xmath21 fine structure emission at lower temperatures , is included by use of the fitting formula of @xcite , @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the gas temperature in kelvin . treating radiation from young , massive stars to be the main source of heating via the dust grain photoelectric effect , 
 the gas heating rate is set to be proportional to the recent , global sfr surface density @xmath24 , @xmath25\,{\rm erg}\ , { \rm s}^{-1}\ , , \label{eq : heating}\ ] ] where @xmath26 is the solar neighborhood heating rate and @xmath27 is the sfr surface density in the solar neighborhood . the term @xmath28 accounts for a metagalactic fuv radiation field . 
 radiative shielding of fuv photons , an important effect at high gas column densities , is not included .    supernova feedback is included in the form of instantaneous momentum injection at a rate proportional to the local star formation rate , as set by the free - fall time of gas with an efficiency of @xmath29 above a critical density threshold . the momentum from each supernova is set to @xmath30 representing the value at the radiative stage of a single supernova remnant ( see @xcite and references therein ) . 
 this approach does not form or follow the hot ( @xmath31 ) ism phase , but instead focuses on the self - consistent turbulent driving , dissipation , and gravitational collapse of the atomic medium , the main gas reservoir of the ism . 
 the absence of a hot phase will have only a minimal effect on our results , since we are mainly concerned with molecule formation processes that are restricted to much lower temperatures . 
 we utilize the chemical network described in @xcite which we briefly summarize here . 
 the full chemical network consists of 32 atomic and molecular species and @xmath32 chemical and photoreactions . 
 the abundances of only 14 of these species ( h@xmath33 , @xmath0 , he@xmath33 , c@xmath33 , o@xmath33 , oh , h@xmath34o , co , c@xmath34 , o@xmath34 , hco@xmath33 , ch , ch@xmath34 , and ch@xmath35 ) are computed by formal integration , i.e. , via solving a stiff set of coupled ordinary differential equations . 
 the abundances of the remaining species are computed by either assuming instantaneous chemical equilibrium ( as in the case of h@xmath36 , @xmath37 , h@xmath35 , ch@xmath33 , ch@xmath38 , oh@xmath33 , h@xmath34o@xmath33 , and h@xmath39o@xmath33 , species that react so rapidly as to always be close to their equilibrium abundance values ) or by utilizing conservation laws ( for e@xmath36 , h , he , c , and o ) , thus reducing the number of coupled differential equations , and computational cost , that must be integrated to solve the full chemical network .    to model photodissociation and photoionization , we take the shape and strength of the interstellar radiation field ( isrf ) to follow the standard @xcite field . in habing units , the strength of the draine field is @xmath40 , where the @xcite radiation field is defined to be @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the angle averaged specific intensity and the integral runs over the fuv range , from @xmath43 . 
 the photodissociation and photoionization rate for any given chemical species can be written as @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the photorate in optically thin gas ( see table b2 in @xcite ) , and @xmath46 is the degree by which the photorate is reduced as compared with the optically thin rate . 
 we defer a discussion of how the shielding factors @xmath46 and unattenuated radiative intensity @xmath47 are determined to section [ sec : raytrace ] .      in a subset of our models 
 we evolve the temperature to equilibrium along with the chemical abundances . in this section 
 we describe these heating and cooling processes . 
 in the low temperature , moderate density , molecular ism , line emission originating from the rotational transitions of co is a major source of radiative cooling . 
 the volumetric cooling rate from co can be written as @xmath48 . 
 in general , the co cooling function @xmath49 is a complicated function of temperature , density , column density , and velocity dispersion , and in a multidimensional simulation it is not feasible to self - consistently solve for the level populations in every computational cell . 
 hence , we employ the despotic  code @xcite to pre - compute the co cooling function . utilizing the large velocity gradient approximation 
 , we tabulate @xmath49 as a function of @xmath50 , temperature , and , following @xcite , an effective column density per velocity @xmath51 defined such that @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the co number density . the local velocity divergence , @xmath54 , 
 is computed using a three - point stencil around the cell of interest . during the computation we read in the despotic - computed cooling tables and employ tri - linear interpolation to compute the co cooling rate as needed . 
 in addition to co line cooling , we also consider fine - structure line emission from @xmath55 $ ] , @xmath56 $ ] , @xmath57 $ ] . 
 in the case of these species , because their lines remain optically thin under all the conditions found in our calculations , it is straightforward to solve for the level populations and compute the cooling rate directly . 
 we use the collisional rate coefficients , atomic data , and methodology presented in @xcite . 
 the rate of energy exchange between gas and dust is @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the dust - gas coupling coefficient for mliky way dust in @xmath0 dominated regions @xcite and @xmath60 is the dust temperature . in principle 
 @xmath60 can be determined self - consistently by considering dust to be in thermal equilibrium between absorption and emission , but for simplicity here we assume a constant dust temperature of @xmath61 . 
 this should be an acceptable approximation since gas - dust coupling does not typically become important until @xmath62 , a regime not probed here . 
 cooling due to the collisional excitation of atomic hydrogen , or lyman-@xmath63 , is given by @xcite , @xmath64 where @xmath65 , and @xmath66 and @xmath67 are the electron and neutral hydrogen densities , respectively . 
 the photoelectric heating rate , including recombination cooling , is given by @xcite , @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the attenuated radiation field strength described in section [ sec : raytrace ] , @xmath70 , @xmath71 , and @xmath72 is the photoelectric heating efficiency . 
 the heating rate due to cosmic ray ionization is given by @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the cosmic ray ionization rate per hydrogen nucleus which we take to be @xmath75 , a relatively low value that aids in the production of co. the energy added per cosmic ray ionization @xmath76 depends on the chemical composition of the gas . for purely atomic gas 
 we use the recommendation from @xcite , @xmath77 while we use a piecewise fit given in ( * ? ? ? * equation b3 ) of numerical data from @xcite for @xmath78 .    note that we do not include any sort of heating due to turbulent dissipation or ambipolar diffusion , two related effects whose combined heating rate can be comparable to the cosmic ray heating rate for the low cosmic ray ionization rate we adopt here ( e.g. , * ? ? ? 
 modeling radiation transport in full generality within a three - dimensional simulation presents a significant numerical challenge . 
 as noted by @xcite , the cost of multifrequency radiation transfer scales as @xmath79 , where @xmath80 is the number of discrete frequency bins and @xmath81 is the number of computational elements . even with moderate resolution , this is orders - of - magnitude larger than the hydrodynamic evolution , which scales as @xmath82 , and generally intractable . while a number of approximate methods exist for solving the equation of radiative transfer in a numerical simulation    ( e.g. , 
 * ; * ? ? ? 
 * ; * ? ? ? 
 * ) , these approaches are not suitable for line transfer calculations , which are crucial for determination of the photoreaction rates . here , we elect to solve for the radiation field , and chemical state , by direct ray - tracing applied to static simulation snapshots . 
 -axis with a separation equal to the cell spacing @xmath83 . the next set of rays ( green arrows ) are launched with an angle of @xmath84 with respect to the @xmath85-axis and maintain a perpendicular separation @xmath83 with the first set of rays . 
 this choice guarantees the computational domain is evenly sampled by rays for each angular set of rays . only when the rays are physically located within the computational grid ( solid boxes ) is the ray tracing performed.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]      the radiation intensity at any point along a ray is governed by the time - independent radiative transfer equation , @xmath86 where @xmath87 is the specific intensity , @xmath88 is the absorption coefficient , @xmath89 is the emissivity , and @xmath90 is the distance along the ray . 
 we are particularly concerned with fuv photons whose dominant sources are stars with ages of @xmath91 myr or less . since the simulation does not follow young stars explicitly , and since by this age stars are generally no longer predominantly found in clusters ( e.g. , * ? ? ? 
 * ; * ? ? ? 
 * ) , we approximate their distribution as a smooth field that varies with height @xmath16 alone . 
 we therefore assign every grid cell a frequency - dependent fuv emissivity @xmath92 , where the normalization @xmath93 is fixed by the requirement that the unattenuated midplane isrf intensity , @xmath94 , is in accordance with the current sfr surface density : @xmath95 where @xmath24 and @xmath96 retain their definitions from equation [ eq : heating ] . for the vertical distribution of the fuv emissivity 
 we adopt the profile @xmath97 appropriate for an isothermal disc , where @xmath98 is the stellar scale height . for our fiducial model 
 we adopt a scale height of @xmath99 , though we do explore how variations in @xmath98 affect our results .    even in a static snapshot , 
 solving the transfer equation in three dimensions with enough frequency resolution to resolve the dominant photodissociation lines of every important species is prohibitively expensive . 
 fortunately , it is also unnecessary for the purpose of computing photoreaction rates , which is our goal . 
 photodissociation for important interstellar species occurs via resonant absorption of an fuv photon in one or more bands that occupy a relatively narrow range of frequencies . 
 one - dimensional simulations that include full frequency - dependent transfer show that the photodissociation rate produced by the isrf decreases as the radiation propagates through increasing columns of material due to two main effects : continuum absorption by dust , and resonant absorption of photons near the centers of the dissociating absorption lines @xcite .    for dust , 
 the reduction in the photodissociation rate is given by @xmath100 where @xmath101 is the scaling between the dust opacity at the photodissociation absorption frequency and the v - band . here 
 @xmath102 is the dust opacity evaluated at the absorption band relevant for that species , which is taken to be at a single characteristic frequency , a good approximation since @xmath102 varies slowly with @xmath103 over the band ; @xmath104 is the v - band dust opacity . 
 for the chemical species we consider , @xmath105 ranges from @xmath106 to @xmath107 . 
 the visual extinction in magnitudes @xmath108 is directly proportional to the total column density of h nuclei , @xmath109 , @xmath110 where @xmath111 @xcite is the total dust cross section in the v - band per hydrogen nucleus .    to properly model the photodissociation of @xmath0 and co we must also consider self - shielding in which the molecules themselves , in addition to dust grains , contribute to the attenuation of fuv photons . 
 self - shielding of @xmath0 can be well approximated with the following analytic expression from @xcite , @xmath112 where @xmath113 , @xmath114 , and @xmath115 is the doppler broadening parameter for @xmath0 . 
 the total shielding factor for @xmath0 will be @xmath116 . 
 co not only experiences self - shielding and dust shielding , but is additionally shielded by molecular hydrogen . 
 the photodissociation rate for co can be written as @xmath117 , where @xmath118 is the co self - shielding function and @xmath119 accounts for the cross - shielding of co by the overlapping lyman - werner lines of @xmath0 . 
 both @xmath120 and @xmath121 are taken from @xcite , while @xmath122 . 
 a critical point to realize is that , because the co and h@xmath34 self - shielding factors result from a rearrangement of the photon frequency distribution as radiation propagates along a ray , they may be applied independently on every ray . 
 this means that , rather than requiring many frequency bins to resolve the dissociating lines of h@xmath34 and co , we can approximate the effect by considering a single frequency bin for h@xmath34-dissociating photons , and similarly for co - dissociating ones , and use the pre - tabulated shielding functions to model the reduction in photodissociation rate along a ray . 
 the main limitation in this approach is that the shielding functions have been tabulated for gas with a fixed velocity dispersion and zero bulk velocity , whereas in our simulations the velocity fields are significantly more complex . 
 however , we show below that our results are quite insensitive to exactly how we estimate the velocity - dispersion that enters the shielding factors .      based on the discussion in the preceding section , we now discretize the equation of radiative transfer ( equation [ eq : rad_transfer ] ) by defining three distinct frequency bins : one describing radiation in the fuv dust continuum , @xmath123 , one that corresponds to the lyman - werner bands for @xmath0 , @xmath124 , and one describing the photodissociation of co , @xmath125 . 
 the three frequency bins can be formally defined through the following filters : @xmath126 defined such that @xmath127 and @xmath128 equal unity in the frequency ranges that overlap with their photodissociation absorption lines , and are zero otherwise . 
 likewise , @xmath129 in the fuv frequency range , excluding the photoabsorption lines of @xmath0 and co , and is zero otherwise . 
 the intensity at any point @xmath90 along a ray is given by the formal solution to equation ( [ eq : rad_transfer ] ) , @xmath130 identifying @xmath131 to be the shielding factor @xmath46 ( equation [ eq : photo_shield ] ) and integrating over the frequency filters defined in equation ( [ eq : filters ] ) gives us the intensity in our three frequency bins : @xmath132 @xmath133 @xmath134 in the above equations , the shielding factors are evaluated using the total column densities between points @xmath90 and @xmath135 , @xmath136 , @xmath137 , and similarly for @xmath138 and @xmath139      we are now in a position to discretize the equations ( [ eq : ih2 ] ) , ( [ eq : ico ] ) , and ( [ eq : icont ] ) in a way suitable for numerical calculation . consider a ray passing through our cartesian grid at some angle , and consider the @xmath140th cell along that ray . 
 let the sequence of cells through which the ray passes on its way to that cell @xmath140 be numbered @xmath141 , and let @xmath142 be the path length of the ray through cell @xmath143 ; let @xmath144 be the corresponding number density of species @xmath145 ( e.g. , h@xmath34 ) , and similarly for all other quantities . in this case equation ( [ eq : ih2 ] ) 
 can be discretized to @xmath146 where the shielding factor , which includes both dust- and self - shielding , is evaluated using the total column @xmath147 between the cells @xmath140 and @xmath143 . 
 similar results hold for equations ( [ eq : ico ] ) and ( [ eq : icont ] ) . 
 we have now written down a discretized version of the radiative transfer equation for a particular direction of propagation . 
 the remaining step is to discretize the problem in angle . 
 we do so by drawing rays in @xmath148 directions ( parametrized by @xmath84 and @xmath149 ) selected via the healpix algorithm for equal area spherical discretization @xcite . 
 all our models use healpix level @xmath150 , corresponding @xmath151 , which we have found provides sufficient resolution to properly sample the radiation field . for each direction 
 , we draw through the computational domain a series of rays separated by one cell spacing @xmath83 in the direction perpendicular to the rays , such that each ray represents a solid angle @xmath152 and area @xmath153 . 
 this choice guarantees that each cell is intersected by at least @xmath148 rays in total . 
 we show a schematic diagram of our ray tracing procedure in figure [ fig : gridfig ] . 
 the radiation intensity in any given cell is then able to be computed through an angle average of all intersecting rays . 
 we are ultimately interested in photodissociation rates which are in turn proportional to the angle - averaged intensity , @xmath154 and similarly for all other species . evaluating this 
 integral requires some subtlety ; although all our rays represent an equal amount of solid angle , not all rays intersecting a cell have the same path length @xmath155 through it , even rays that represent the same direction of radiation propagation . 
 the contribution to the mean intensity in a cell from a given ray @xmath140 will be proportional to the time that the photons propagating along that ray spend in the cell , and thus proportional to @xmath156 . 
 we therefore compute the mean intensity by weighting each ray s contribution by @xmath155 : @xmath157 where @xmath158 is the total number of rays that intersected the cell . 
 the conversion between @xmath159 and @xmath160 is implicitly performed through a proper choice of the normalization of the fuv cell emissivity , @xmath161 . 
 we are interested in comparing the results obtained with the full angle - dependent ray - trace in the previous section to those produced by various local approximations for the degree of radiative shielding that have been proposed . in these approximations , 
 the factor by which a chemical species photodissociation rate is reduced relative to its optically thin rate , @xmath46 , is solely dependent on an effective column density : @xmath162 in the case of dust shielding , and @xmath163 in the case of @xmath0 and co shielding . working under the approximation of uniform density and chemical composition , we can rewrite column density as the product of number density and some shielding length scale , @xmath164 . 
 this significantly reduces the complexity and computational expense of multidimensional , multifrequency radiative transfer to the relatively simple task of computing an appropriate , physically motivated shielding length @xmath165 . 
 various physically motivated expressions for @xmath165 have been proposed and utilized , to varying degrees of success . 
 the sobolev approximation , alternatively known as the large velocity gradient ( lvg ) approach , was originally devised by @xcite to study expanding stellar envelopes , but has been used extensively in simulations to model the photodissociation of @xmath0 ( e.g. , * ? ? ? 
 * ; * ? ? ? 
 * ; * ? ? ? 
 * ; * ? ? ? 
 * ; * ? ? ? 
 it relies on the observation that in regions with a constant velocity gradient @xmath166 , a photon will see doppler shifted absorption lines with respect to its emission frame . 
 @xcite proposed that once a photon is doppler shifted by one thermal linewidth , the photon should be free to escape . 
 thus , we can define the sobolev length to be @xmath167 where @xmath168 is the local sound speed and the local velocity divergence @xmath54 serves as a multidimensional analog to @xmath166 . 
 the jeans length @xmath169 is the critical length scale under which the force of gravity overwhelms outward thermal pressure allowing gravitational collapse to proceed . 
 the jeans length is a common approximation for @xmath165 , with the physical justification that at the center of a gravitationally collapsing core , the radiative background will be attenuated by a column of gas with a length scale approximately equal to @xmath170 . 
 we also investigate a shielding length based on the local density and its gradient such that @xmath171 the density gradient approach has been used by @xcite to account for the self - shielding of @xmath0 from photodissociating radiation and provided reasonable accuracy in the column density range @xmath172 . 
 an additional method to account for radiative shielding is to utilize the results of a full ray trace run to calibrate a relationship between density and column density ( or equivalently , visual extinction ) . we we will show in section [ sec : results ] , this relationship can be approximated as @xmath173 which holds above a density of @xmath174 and becomes increasingly accurate with increasing density . 
 this method naturally has the disadvantage that it is perhaps unique to the particular physical system one is examining which detracts form its generality . 
 a highly simplified approach to account for radiative shielding is to assume that all shielding in a given cell is due to matter in the cell in question , such that @xmath175 pc . 
 this single - cell approximation will surely underestimate the degree of radiative shielding , and thus molecular chemical abundances , as compared with the fiducial ray - tracing model , allowing limits to be placed on the effectiveness of radiative shielding .    finally , 
 while not a strictly local approach , we perform a model where ray tracing is only performed over the six directions aligned with the cartesian axes , instead of the @xmath176 healpix selected directions in the ray trace models . 
 this approach , known as the six - ray approximation , can be computationally efficient since the transport of rays exploits the alignment of the grid . 
 it is a compromise between a local approach and full - fledged , multi - angle radiative transfer .    for this to be a clean comparison , 
 the local and ray - trace models need to utilize the same unattenuated radiation field @xmath47 so that the sole difference between the various methodologies is in the computation of @xmath46 . to achieve this , in the local models we begin by performing the multiangle ray - trace procedure described in section [ sec : raytrace ] , but with all radiative shielding turned off , @xmath177 , providing us with the unattenuated radiation field @xmath47 in each grid cell . this unattenuated field 
 is then used in equation [ eq : photo_shield ] , along with the locally determined @xmath46 , to compute the chemical photodissociation rates .    ,

 ( 1 ) the total gas mass fraction with an @xmath0 ( first column ) or co ( second column ) fraction greater than @xmath106 . 
 the second number , after the slash , is the equivalent quantity when only considering cold , dense gas ( @xmath184 , @xmath185 ) . 
 ( 2 ) the total mass in the fiducial simulation ( f1 ) is @xmath186 . 
 ( 3 ) see text surrounding equation [ eq : err ] for the description of the @xmath0 and co error measurements .              to model the spatial distribution of fuv emissivity ( as required by equation [ eq : soln ] ) 
 we treat massive ob stars as the primary emitters of fuv radiation whose vertical density obeys the functional form of equation [ eq : fz ] . 
 the fiducial model f1 utilized a vertical scale height of @xmath187pc , roughly consistent with the measured mean half - width of @xmath0 in the inner galaxy of @xmath188pc @xcite . 
 models v1 and v2 , which use scale heights of @xmath189 and @xmath190pc , respectively , demonstrate the relatively insensitivity of our results to @xmath98 . 
 inspecting table [ tab : results ] , model v1 has @xmath191 more @xmath0 and @xmath192 more co than f1 , reasonable considering that a reduction ( increase ) in @xmath98 lowers ( increases ) the overall global number of fuv photodissociating photons . 
 model v2 has a corresponding decrease in amount of @xmath0 , though less than a @xmath29 reduction in the total co mass as compared with f1 . 
 morphologically , models v1 and v2 are virtually indistinguishable from f1 . 
 models v3 through v6 , in which one or a number of shielding mechanisms are artificially switched off , are designed to assess the relative importance of self- and dust - shielding in determining the molecular abundances . 
 unsurprisingly , each of these models results in overall less @xmath0 and co mass than the comparison model f1 . 
 models v3 , v4 , v5 , v6 have , respectively , @xmath193 , @xmath193 , @xmath194 , and @xmath195% the mass of @xmath0 as model f1 . as for the co mass , 
 these percentages become @xmath196 , @xmath197 , @xmath198 , and @xmath199% ( table [ tab : results ] ) . 
 figures [ fig : proj.shielding.h2 ] and [ fig : proj.shielding.co ] show mass - weighted projections of the @xmath0 and co fractions for models f1 , v3 , v4 , v5 , and v6 . 
 a comparison of models f1 with v3 and v4 in figure [ fig : proj.shielding.h2 ] highlights the importance of @xmath0 self - shielding in attenuating the isrf and reducing the @xmath0 photodissociation rate . 
 the @xmath0 fractions in models v3 and v4 , which do not include @xmath0 self - shielding ( equation [ eq : fh2 ] ; @xmath200 ) , are substantially suppressed ( by nearly a factor of @xmath201  see table [ tab : results ] ) compared with models that do include self - shielding . in these models , 
 @xmath0 fractions of unity are only realized in the highest density gas that approaches the resolution of this study . 
 switching off co self- and cross - shielding , model v5 , unsurprisingly has no effect on the @xmath0 abundance .    in model v6 dust 
 shielding is deactivated in an effort to isolate its role in reducing the direct photodissociation rates of @xmath0 and co. importantly , dust shielding remains active for all other species besides @xmath0 and co. this choice removes the indirect effect that increased photodissociation rates for other chemical species would have in altering the chemical formation pathways of co and , to a much lesser extent , @xmath0 . as shown in the far right panel of figure [ fig : proj.shielding.h2 ] , the removal of dust shielding has a fairly small , though non - zero , effect on the @xmath0 fraction . 
 in contrast to @xmath0 , self - shielding , cross - shielding by @xmath0 , though whether this stems from @xmath0 cross - shielding or reduced co formation rates is a subtle issue we explore later in this section ] , and dust shielding are all comparably important in photoshielding co molecules . 
 this can be seen in figure [ fig : proj.shielding.co ] where each model results in a significant decrease in the amount of co as compared with model f1 . 
 model v4 , in which @xmath0 self - shielding is switched - off and the global @xmath0 fractions are significantly reduced , demonstrates the importance of @xmath0 shielding co via their overlapping photodissociation lines in the lyman - werner bands . 
 models v5 and v6 , meanwhile , respectively underscore the importance of self- and dust shielding . however , the inclusion of _ any _ form of radiative shielding , whether from self- , cross- , or dust - shielding , results in the formation of gas with @xmath202 at the highest densities , @xmath203 . 
 model v10 ( not shown ) , in which all radiative shielding is turned off , results in no gas with @xmath204 , a statement that additionally applies to @xmath0 . 
 we can explore this further by examining the cumulative distribution functions ( cdf ) of @xmath205 and @xmath206 for models v3-v6 and f1 , which we plot in figure [ fig : shielding.cdf.cd ] . here , we restrict this analysis to cold , dense gas as this makes for a more potent demonstration of the competing factors at work ; qualitatively identical conclusions would be drawn from the cdfs that included all gas . 
 focusing first on @xmath0 ( left panels ) , we see the removal of dust shielding only reduces the gas fraction with @xmath207 as compared with model f1 . 
 turning off @xmath0 self - shielding ( models v3 and v4 ) , conversely , suppresses the @xmath0 mass @xmath208 for gas with @xmath209 . 
 here it is clear that by and large the dominant mechanism by which @xmath0 is shielded from the fuv isrf is self - shielding , at least for the range of isrf properties probed in these simulations . in the analytic models of @xcite , the relative importance of self - shielding and dust shielding depends on the value of @xmath210 , equation [ eq : chi ] . at milky way values of @xmath210 the two processes 
 are about equally important , but as noted above , the simulations we analyze here have radiation field intensities that are @xmath211 times smaller than those found in the solar neighborhood , so the relative dominance of self - shielding is not surprising . 
 ( left panels ) and co fraction ( right panels ) . 
 this analysis is restricted to cold , dense gas ( @xmath184 , @xmath185 ) . 
 lines of different color denote models with different treatments of dust- and self - shielding as described in the text.,scaledwidth=53.0% ]    as for co , a great deal of information can be extracted from a comparison of the various cdfs , shown in the right panels of figure [ fig : shielding.cdf.cd ] . 
 model v4 does not include @xmath0 self - shielding ( @xmath200 ) and as a consequence has a highly suppressed @xmath0 fraction . 
 this choice encapsulates two combined effects , one chemical and one radiative , both of which act to decrease the amount of co. first , @xmath212 ( the cross - shielding factor ) is reduced as the global @xmath0 column densities are significantly reduced . 
 second , the two predominant co formation pathways ( one involving oh , and the other ch ) both rely on the availability of @xmath0 , thus reducing the overall speed of the chemical formation pathways that lead to co. these effects combined result in the co mass being suppressed by a factor of @xmath213 for @xmath214 compared with model f1  the suppression increases with increasing co fraction . from this model alone , however , is it unclear which of these two effects , chemical or radiative , is dominant . 
 model v5 does not include co self - shielding nor cross - shielding from @xmath0 . as can be seen , this has little effect in gas with a low co fraction ( @xmath215 ) . 
 evidently for this diffuse co gas , co self - shielding and @xmath0 cross - shielding is relatively unimportant . for co rich gas ( @xmath216 ) , 
 the mass in co is suppressed by a factor of @xmath217 . 
 chemically , there is no suppression of the @xmath0 abundance in this model so any reduction in @xmath206 is entirely due to the lack of shielding from itself and @xmath0 .    the drop in the co fraction between models v5 and v3 is a chemical , not radiative , effect and highlights the role of @xmath0 in the co formation pathways . 
 observe that the sole difference between models v5 and v3 is that the @xmath0 fraction in model v3 is highly suppressed due to the lack of @xmath0 self - shielding . with regards to co 
 , this isolates the effect that the @xmath0 abundance has on the efficiency of the chemical pathways that lead to co. quantitatively , this purely chemical effect reduces the total co mass by @xmath218% ( see table [ tab : results ] ) . furthermore , at the highest co fractions , there is no difference between model v5 and v3 in terms of the cdf , while model v4 still displays a roughly order - of - magnitude drop . 
 this implies that a reduction in the @xmath0 fraction ( via removing @xmath0 self - shielding ) decreases the co fraction predominantly through less @xmath0 cross - shielding and a larger co photodissociation rate , as opposed to a reduction in the co formation rate . 
 the co fractions realized in the absence of dust shielding ( model v6 ) are similar to that of models v3 and v4 for @xmath219 , underscoring the importance of dust shielding for co. in other words , the consequence of removing dust shielding for co is roughly comparable to the combined removal of co self - shielding , @xmath0 cross - shielding , and decreased co formation efficiency due to a suppressed @xmath0 abundance . evidently , dust shielding is critical for the formation of co fractions approaching unity . in the absence of dust 
 shielding , no gas is able to form with @xmath220 . 
 models v7 and v8 consider the scenario where the overall strength of the fuv radiative intensity is , respectively , increased or decreased by a factor of @xmath221 . increasing the isrf by a factor of @xmath221 ( v7 ) results in a @xmath222 decrease in both the total @xmath0 and co mass , while decreasing the radiative intensity tenfold ( v8 ) results in a factor of @xmath223 more @xmath0 and @xmath224 times more co mass .    in model v9 
 , the cosmic - ray ionization rate is increased from @xmath225 to @xmath226s@xmath227 to gauge its impact on molecular chemistry . 
 this has a much more severe effect on the co abundance than the @xmath0 abundance . 
 as seen in table [ tab : results ] , increasing @xmath74 reduced the global @xmath0 mass by roughly a factor of @xmath150 , while the co mass fell to roughly @xmath228 its value in model f1 . 
 this strong dependance of the co abundance on the cosmic ray ionization rate is an indirect effect , stemming mainly from the cosmic ray ionization of neutral helium and the subsequent charge - exchange destructive reaction between he@xmath33 and co.    finally , in model v10 , all radiative shielding is switched off , causing a catastrophic decrease in the abundances of @xmath0 and co. as can be seen in table [ tab : results ] , this results in zero gas with an @xmath0 or co fraction higher than @xmath106 . 
 the total molecular mass is also significantly reduced ; the total mass of @xmath0 and co is @xmath229 and @xmath230 , respectively , as compared to model f1 . 
 this result only underscores the importance of radiative shielding in permitting the formation of significant molecular abundances . 
 however , as will be shown in section [ sec : temperature ] , the removal of all radiative shielding has a relatively small effect on the temperature structure of the gas .       is entirely due to the vertical dependance of the unattenuated radiation field . 
 the primary effect of changing the fuv intensity ( models t3 and t4 ) is a shift in the density at which gas transitions from the warm to cold neutral medium . 
 the blue shaded region in the top panel denotes this paper s definition of cold , dense gas.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    in models t1-t4 , the gas temperature is evolved to equilibrium along with the chemical abundances , utilizing the thermal processes described in section [ sec : thermal ] . 
 model t1 is identical to model f1 save for the temperature evolution , while model t2 operates under optically thin conditions , i.e. , no radiative shielding . in models t3 and t4 the mean fuv intensity is altered , though are otherwise identical to model t1 . in figure 
 [ fig : dts.compare ] we show density - temperature diagrams for models f1 ( whose density and temperature are unchanged from the values initially supplied by k15 ) , t1 , t2 , t3 , and t4 . at any given density , 
 the spread in temperature for model t1 is significantly reduced as compared with model f1 . 
 in fact , any spread in temperature in model t1 , at a given density , is overwhelmingly due to spatial variations in the photoelectric heating rate ( equation [ eq : photoelectric ] ) which arises due to differences in the degree of radiative shielding ( via @xmath231 ) and the vertical dependance of the fuv emissivity ( equation [ eq : fz ] ) and consequently the unattenuated radiation field @xmath47 . aside from this reduction in the temperature spread , the density - temperature relationship between models f1 and t1 agree remarkably well below a density of @xmath232 . above @xmath233 , 
 the temperature in model t1 begins to drop below that of f1 , reaching @xmath234 by @xmath235 as a result of co line emission , a cooling pathway not included in k15 . 
 the relationship between density and temperature in model t2 , which does not include the effect of radiative shielding , is similar to that of model t1 below @xmath236 . 
 the only significant difference between the two models is the absence of @xmath237 degree gas at the highest densities , due to the complete lack of any significant co cooling , in model t2 . even by increasing the midplane @xmath47 by a factor of @xmath221 to @xmath238 ( model t3 ) 
 , a cold phase still develops , though at a slightly larger density and equilibrium temperature of @xmath239 before co cooling cools the gas below @xmath240 . 
 model t4 , with its tenfold reduction in the strength of the midplane fuv intensity , exhibits the emergence of a molecular cold phase at the relatively low density of @xmath241 . 
 the molecular nature of this cold phase should be viewed as an artifact of our equilibrium assumption , given the chemical time at @xmath242 is of order @xmath221 gyr  see section [ sec : discussion ] . 
 the minimum temperature obtained in model t4 is also lower than any other model , nearly reaching the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) temperature floor ( @xmath243 ) around @xmath244 . 
 while radiative shielding is crucial for the formation of significant molecule fractions ( section [ sec : variations ] ) and for reaching the lowest temperatures observed in the ism , the ubiquitous appearance of a marginally cold phase ( where @xmath6 ) in all these models supports the important point that shielding is not strictly required for the transition to a cold phase , at least in the regime where the background fuv radiation field strength is relatively modest , @xmath245 . 
 the primary objective in this section is to assess the validity and accuracy of utilizing a locally computed shielding length to model radiative attenuation and thus the fuv - radiation regulated chemical state . 
 we will do this by examining how closely the local models l1-l6 reproduce the @xmath0 and co abundances of the fiducial model f1 using a variety of qualitative and quantitative measures . 
 considering first the total mass of @xmath0 ( @xmath246 , table [ tab : results ] column @xmath247 ) , we see all the local models come within a factor of @xmath150 of f1 , with the exception of model l2 ( sobolev approximation ) which results in @xmath248% less @xmath0 . 
 the total mass of co is a bit more scattered than @xmath246 , though the four best performing local models ( l1a , l3 , l4 , and l6 ) have @xmath249 within @xmath250% of model f1 s value . 
 any given local approximation model always produces an increase ( or decrease ) between both the total @xmath0 and co masses , with the exception of model l3 ( density gradient ) which , due to the peculiarity of using density gradients to estimate a global column density , results in @xmath251% less @xmath0 , and nearly @xmath252% _ more _ co , than model f1 . 
 the morphology and distribution of @xmath0 between models l1-l6 and f1 ( figure [ fig : proj.local_compare.h2 ] ) highlights the relative similarity between the distribution of molecular hydrogen in many of the local approximation models compared with the fiducial model . 
 evidently the exact prescription used to account for the attenuation of the isrf is a relatively unimportant factor in modeling the overall distribution of @xmath0 gas . 
 the inclusion of _ some _ form of radiative shielding , however , is a necessary ingredient to form any significant @xmath0 fraction  not shown here is model v10 ( no shielding ) in which no cell of gas achieves an @xmath0 ( or co ) fraction greater than @xmath253 and results in a factor @xmath254 less @xmath0 and co mass . 
 it is important , however , to scrutinize any variation between the various local models and model f1 in figure [ fig : proj.local_compare.h2 ] . 
 models in which radiative shielding is based on the local jeans length ( l1 and l1a ) or a power - law fit between @xmath255 and @xmath178 ( l4 ) appear to slightly overestimate the @xmath0 fraction , while a shielding length computed via the velocity divergence ( sobolev length ; l2 ) , the density gradient ( l3 ) , or a single computational cell ( l5 ) , tend to underpredict @xmath205 . by eye , the best level of agreement 
 is achieved by the six - ray approximation ( model l6 ) ; this is not a strictly a local approximation , but is instead effectively the result of reducing the number of ray - tracing propagation directions from @xmath176 to @xmath247 , now all aligned along the cartesian axes . 
 in contrast to @xmath0 , the spatial distribution and amount of co ( figure [ fig : proj.local_compare.co ] ) shows a great deal more sensitivity to the radiative shielding prescription . 
 as compared with model f1 , models l2 and l5 fail to produce any gas with visually discernible co. in model l3 there exists what appears to be an unphysical scattering of cells with @xmath206 approaching unity and a paucity of diffuse co , @xmath256 . as with @xmath0 , the six - ray approximation ( model l6 ) appears to do the best job in reproducing @xmath206 . it should be noted , though , that large concentrations of co can be difficult to discern given the small spatial extent of these concentrations . 
 model l1 , where @xmath257 , seems to perform reasonably well in matching @xmath206 from model f1 , except for the appearance of two large ( @xmath258pc ) structures with @xmath259 that do not exist in model f1 . 
 we attribute this to out - of - equilibrium hot gas with density @xmath260 and temperature @xmath261 . since the jeans length @xmath262 , these cells have an unphysical elevated shielding length which reduces the fuv radiation intensity and boosts the co abundance . 
 this is an undesired effect of modeling @xmath165 with @xmath263  these cells do not represent gravitationally collapsing cores and physically should not experience a higher degree of radiative shielding . 
 this shortcoming can be addressed quite simply , however , by introducing a temperature ceiling into the calculation of @xmath263 . in model l1a the shielding length is given by this temperature capped jeans length with an empirically chosen ceiling temperature of @xmath264 . 
 an inspection of figure [ fig : proj.local_compare.co ] confirms that these unphysical co rich bubbles are strongly suppressed in model l1a .    to better understand the relationship amongst the local models , in figure [ fig : local_compare.dens.av.phase ] we plot 
 the mass - weighted effective extinction ( equation [ eq : aveff ] ) as a function of density for each local model as compared with model f1 ( previously plotted in figure [ fig : dens_av_phase ] ) . here 
 it is clear how well models l1 , l1a , l4 , and l6 perform in matching the effective visual extinction as computed from detailed ray - tracing , at least at high densities , @xmath265 . 
 models based on local derivatives of grid - based quantities severely overpredict ( l3 ) or underpredict ( l2 ) the true column density . 
 caution should be used in interpreting figure [ fig : local_compare.dens.av.phase ] ; in doing so , one would be led to conclude that model l4 should be the best performing local model since it was explicitly calibrated to match the @xmath266 relationship from model f1 . as discussed in section [ sec : variations ] , @xmath0 is primarily shielded by itself , the degree of which is a function of the @xmath0 column density @xmath267 , not @xmath162 . thus the @xmath268 relationship is not the ideal proxy for how well a model will predict the @xmath0 abundance .    it is important to have a single number that characterizes the level of agreement , with regards to the spatial distribution of @xmath0 and co , between each local approximation model and the fiducial model f1 . 
 many such quantitative metrics could be constructed which effectively compress a three - dimensional error distribution to a single value . for our purposes here , we favor such a metric that represents the ability of a local approximation to accurately model the atomic - to - molecular transition for both @xmath0 and co , rather than one that is sensitive to diffuse molecules and low density gas , since this is most relevant in regards to both observations and molecule - mediated thermo - energetics . to this end , we have found the best metric to be the mass - weighted fractional error of @xmath269 which can be expressed as @xmath270 where @xmath271 , @xmath272 is the density of molecule @xmath85 in model f1 , @xmath273 is the density of molecule @xmath85 in any separate model , @xmath85 denotes either @xmath0 or co , and the sum runs over all cells @xmath274 . 
 equation [ eq : err ] is formulated such that perfect agreement between the molecular abundances would produce @xmath275 , while @xmath276 signifies the local approximation model formed no molecules of species @xmath85 whatsoever . to prevent extremely small , negligible abundances from skewing this error metric and to better quantify the significant differences amongst the local models , 
 we omit cells with concentrations so low where co would not be a significant coolant , adopting a value of @xmath277 for both co and @xmath0 . 
 we compute the above error metric between model f1 and each other model ( see table [ tab : models ] ) except for f2 and f3 , whose different density maps make this error metric meaningless .    , equation [ eq : aveff ] ) vs. density . 
 lines of different color denote models with different treatments of radiative shielding ( models l1-l6 ) while the black shaded region represents the @xmath181-@xmath278 dispersion of @xmath178 for model f1.,scaledwidth=42.0% ]    an examination of table [ tab : results ] shows that , amongst the local models , the six - ray approximation possesses the smallest @xmath0 weighted error ( l6 , err@xmath279 ) , followed by the temperature capped - jeans length ( l1a , @xmath280 ) and density gradient ( l3 , @xmath281 ) . as for co , model l1a has the lowest error ( err@xmath282 ) followed by the power - law fit ( l4 , @xmath283 ) and single cell shielding ( l5 , @xmath284 ) . 
 this error metric does have limitations , and should be considered along with the other comparison measures . 
 for instance , the relatively low err@xmath285 value of model l5 would suggest it does an excellent job matching the co abundances of f1 , though inspecting its co spatial distribution ( figure [ fig : proj.local_compare.co ] ; see also figure [ fig : xco_fiducial_compare ] ) suggests otherwise . 
 this discrepancy is due to the co error metric ( err@xmath285 , equation [ eq : err ] ) being weighted by @xmath206 , while the logarithmically scaled projections allow the detection of much more diffuse ( @xmath286 ) co.        as a final comparison between models l1-l6 and 
 f1 , we show cell - by - cell , mass - weighted abundance comparisons of @xmath0 and co in figures [ fig : xh2_fiducial_compare ] and [ fig : xco_fiducial_compare ] . 
 these plots are generated by comparing the @xmath0 fraction between model f1 ( @xmath287 ) and each local model ( @xmath288 ) on a cell - by - cell basis ( and similarly for co ) . 
 the color scale represents the mass fraction in a particular region of the @xmath289 phase space . 
 perfect agreement between a local model and model f1 would exclusively lie on the diagonal dashed line defined by @xmath290 . 
 local models based on the jeans length ( l1 , l1a ) or a power - law fit ( l4 ) tend to slightly overpredict the @xmath0 abundance by @xmath291 ( see table [ tab : results ] ) . as expected , when all radiative shielding is assumed to take place in the immediate vicinity of a computational cell ( model l5 ) the @xmath0 abundance is slightly underpredicted by roughly a factor of @xmath150 . 
 models in which the local shielding length requires a computation of a discrete gradient or divergence of a grid variable ( l2 and l3 ) tend to exhibit a larger degree of scatter in the @xmath0 abundance as compared to other local models ( figure [ fig : xh2_fiducial_compare ] ) . 
 as before , model l6 performs the best in matching the results of the fiducial model , overpredicting the total @xmath0 mass by only @xmath292 .    turning to co ( figure [ fig : xco_fiducial_compare ] ) , we see a much larger scatter and discrepancy amongst the local models . 
 models l1 and l3 tend to significantly overpredict the co abundance by up to four orders of magnitude . comparing models l1 and l1a , however , shows how effectively this disagreement can be greatly reduced by imposing a temperature ceiling of @xmath3 in the calculation of the jeans , and thus shielding , length . 
 model l2 is unique in that effectively no gas exists with @xmath259 . 
 single cell radiative shielding ( model l5 ) results in relatively little scatter but an underprediction of the co fraction in all cells save for those with co fractions approaching unity . 
 model l5 and l1a also have a lower @xmath293 ( 1d error representation ) than model l6 , though the 2d error distribution displayed in figure [ fig : xco_fiducial_compare ] seems to suggest l6 to be better performing than l5 and on - par with model l1a , highlighting the utility of multiple error comparisons to gauge the effectiveness of each model in reproducing the molecular abundances of the fiducial model .    finally , it is interesting to note the similarity between models l1a ( jeans with temperature ceiling ) and l4 ( power - law fit ) in their prediction of both the @xmath0 and co abundances . 
 this can be attributed to their respective density scalings : model l4 utilizes a @xmath294 relationship calibrated from model f1 ( @xmath295 ) , while the jeans length approximation can be shown to obey a @xmath296 scaling . 
 the similarity of these exponents should be unsurprising , though , given the physical principle underlying the jeans length : @xmath263 is the appropriate shielding length to utilize when radiative shielding is due to surrounding material in a dense clump undergoing gravitational instability , exactly the physical entities that are able to achieve @xmath297 and @xmath204 in the simulations we analyze here . 
 in this paper we have applied ray - tracing and chemical network integration to static simulation snapshots in an effort to model the distribution , morphology , and amount of @xmath0 and co gas in a finite , but representative , portion of a galactic disk . 
 we have additionally performed calculations where local approximations , instead of ray - tracing , were employed to account for radiative shielding in an effort to assess the validity and accuracy of such radiative transfer alternatives . 
 we find significant concentrations of @xmath0 gas ( @xmath297 ) are vertically restricted to within @xmath298pc of the galactic midplane and possess a filamentary morphology which traces that of the underlying gas distribution . 
 gas with significant co concentrations ( @xmath259 ) is further confined to only the highest density clumps , located interior to @xmath0 rich gas . 
 radiative shielding is crucial for the development of any gas with an @xmath0 or co fraction @xmath299 . when the gas temperature is permitted to reach equilibrium along with the chemical abundances , we find little change from the k15 temperature values ( except for gas at the highest densities , @xmath300 , where co cooling became effective ) , suggesting the bulk of the gas in k15 to exist in thermal equilibrium , and an overall insensitivity of temperature to radiative shielding . 
 different physical mechanisms are responsible for the radiative shielding of @xmath0 and co. for @xmath0 , self - shielding is far dominant over dust shielding in reducing the @xmath0 photodissociation rate in all regimes explored here . the dominant shielding mechanisms for co , on the other hand , are regime dependent . 
 more diffuse co ( @xmath301 ) is shielded primarily by dust and @xmath0 while co rich gas ( @xmath259 ) additionally depends on the presence of self - shielding by the molecule itself . 
 however , this regime dependence for co shielding may be sensitive to the large - scale gas distribution in this particular simulation . 
 we have compared a number of commonly used local approximations for radiative shielding to ray - tracing based solutions of the radiative transfer equation . 
 overall , it is promising how well many of the local models reproduce the @xmath0 and co abundances as compared with a more accurate ray - tracing based approach . 
 one of the main objectives of this work is to inform multidimensional simulations as the validity of these local approximations to account for fuv radiative shielding . 
 based on our analysis , the six - ray approximation ( l6 ) , temperature - capped jeans length ( l1a ) , and power - law ( l4 ) perform the best in matching the @xmath0 and co abundances of model f1 .    among the approximations where the effective shielding length for a given cell ( or , potentially , sph particle ) is exclusively computed from 
 local _ quantities ( thus excluding model l6 ) , the temperature - capped ( at @xmath3 ) jeans length performed the best , an assessment based on its superiority in terms of matching the total @xmath0 and co masses of model f1 , and possessing the smallest @xmath0 and co weighted errors ( equation [ eq : err ] ) . 
 we caution , however , that we have only explored one regime , that of a turbulent galactic disk , with relatively coarse ( @xmath302pc ) resolution . 
 while this regime does include both the h  i-@xmath0 and , at the highest densities , c  ii - co atomic - to - molecular transitions , there are undoubtedly physical environments to which this analysis applies poorly . 
 furthermore , the use of any such an approximation for @xmath165 critically depends on the physics a multidimensional simulation is attempting to probe . if one simply wishes to model the thermal impact of the h  i-@xmath0 and c  ii - co transitions , then coarse approximations , like those discussed above , are likely physically appropriate . on the other hand 
 , we do not recommend such simple approximations when , for example , attempting to reproduce the detailed distribution and concentration of a large number of chemical species for observational comparison . in these cases , performing detailed , multi - frequency radiative transfer in post - processing , or utilizing advanced radiative transfer modules that operate on - the - fly , is a much more appropriate approach . 
 all the models presented here operate under the assumption of steady - state ( equilibrium ) chemistry , the validity of which can be assessed by comparing the chemical and dynamical timescales . 
 taking @xmath303 to be the rate coefficient for @xmath0 formation on grain surfaces , and @xmath304 to be the gas clumping factor on unresolved scales , the chemical time , the timescale for fully atomic gas to convert to molecular form , is given by @xmath305myr . 
 the dynamical time , roughly the timescale for turbulent motions to displace molecular gas , can be expressed as @xmath306 , which assumes a linewidth - size relation @xmath307 @xcite . 
 the assumption of equilibrium is violated when @xmath308 , or equivalently when @xmath309 . 
 thus the equilibrium chemistry is reasonably justified given we focus our analysis on @xmath0 within the high density h  i - h@xmath34 transition . 
 non - equilibrium effects , however , are likely important at lower densities where the @xmath0 formation timescale is much longer . this back - of - the - envelope argument , 
 though , should be compared with actual findings from multidimensional simulations that included non - equilibrium chemistry . 
 the driven turbulence simulations of @xcite identified moderate amounts of molecular hydrogen to be out of chemical equilibrium , a finding they attributed to turbulent transport of @xmath0 from high- to low - density gas that occurs on a shorter timescale than the chemistry can readjust . 
 this same type of mass transport would likely occur within other large - scale simulations . 
 similarly , the colliding flow simulations of @xcite show the assumption of chemical equilibrium can under- or over - predict the true @xmath0 abundance depending on density range and integration time , with the largest discrepancies occurring at early times and , interestingly , high densities . 
 while the assumption of chemical equilibrium likely overestimates the @xmath0 fraction , particularly at low densities , the amount of co is likely _ underestimated _ due to the supernovae feedback prescription in k15 . as discussed in section [ sec : fiducial ] , supernovae events in k15 were modeled by injecting momentum the instant density exceeds the star formation threshold , rather than allowing any time delay . for the original purposes of k15 , which focused on the properties of diffuse atomic gas that is the main ism mass reservoir , the exact timing of supernovae events was unimportant compared to the ability for the supernovae rate to change in time in response to the ism state . however , for the present purposes , this lack of a time delay tends to suppress the formation of large , dense structures where large co abundances would be expected . nonetheless , 
 since our primary objective is to understand the role of radiative shielding and numerical approximations to it in determining the chemical balance of the ism , and not to study the chemical balance itself , this limitation of the simulations does not significantly interfere with our goals .    in future work 
 , we plan to utilize our best performing local model , one in which the temperature - capped jeans length is used as a proxy for @xmath165 , to account for radiative shielding in time - dependent radiation - magneto - hydrodynamic amr zoom - in simulations from galactic disk scales down to stellar cluster scales that will achieve significantly higher concentrations of dense , molecule rich gas than is present in the k15 snapshots . 
 post - processing these snapshots with the tools developed here will further validate the utility of such a local approximation to accurately model fuv radiative shielding and photo - regulated chemistry . 
 we additionally plan to extend the radiative transfer post - processing analysis performed here to different physical systems , notably isolated , dwarf galaxies with sub - parsec resolution and densities approaching @xmath310 ( e.g. , * ? ? ? 
 * ) . in these targets of future analyses , 
 the presence of more and much larger co rich structures will permit the measurement of integrated line intensities , the x - factor , and their variation with metallicity and observation line - of - sight .

 in performing these simulations we vary a number of parameters , such as the isrf strength , vertical scale height of stellar sources , cosmic ray flux , to gauge the sensitivity of our results to these variations . 
 self - shielding permits significant molecular hydrogen ( @xmath0 ) abundances in dense filaments around the disk midplane , accounting for approximately @xmath1% of the total gas mass . 
 significant co fractions only form in the densest , @xmath2 , gas where a combination of dust , @xmath0 , and self - shielding attenuate the fuv background . 
 we additionally compare these ray - tracing based solutions to photochemistry with complementary models where photo - shielding is accounted for with locally computed prescriptions . with some exceptions , these local models for the radiative shielding length perform reasonably well at reproducing the distribution and amount of molecular gas as compared with a detailed , global ray tracing calculation . 
 specifically , an approach based on the jeans length with a @xmath3 temperature cap performs the best in regards to a number of different quantitative measures based on the @xmath0 and co abundances .

"space time explorer & quantum equivalence space test ( ste - quest ) is a medium - sized mission candidate for launch in 2022/2024 in the cosmic vision programme of the european space agency . 
 after recommendation by the space science advisory committee , it was selected to be first studied by esa , followed by two parallel industrial assessment studies . 
 this paper gives a brief summary of the assessment activities by astrium which build on and extend the preceding esa study as described in@xcite . 
 ste - quest aims to study the cornerstones of einstein s equivalence principle ( eep ) , pushing the limits of measurement accuracy by several orders of magnitude compared to what is currently achievable in ground based experiments@xcite . on the one hand 
 , experiments are performed to measure the gravitational red - shift experienced by highly accurate clocks in the gravitational fields of earth or sun ( space time explorer ) . on the other hand , differential accelerations of microscopic quantum particles 
 are measured to test the universality of free fall , also referred to as weak equivalence principle ( quantum equivalence space test ) . 
 these measurements aim at finding possible deviations from predictions of general relativity ( gr ) , as postulated by many theories trying to combine gr with quantum theory . 
 examples include deviations predicted by string theory @xcite , loop quantum gravity@xcite , standard model extension@xcite , anomalous spin - coupling@xcite , and space - time - fluctuations@xcite , among others . 
 the ste - quest mission goal is summarized by the four primary science objectives@xcite which are listed in tab.[tab : mission_objectives ] together with the 4 measurement types geared at achieving them .

 smaller & measurements at perigee + & @xmath5 & + 
 the ste - quest mission is complex and comprises a space - segment as well as a ground segment , with both contributing to the science performance . 
 highly stable bi - directional microwave ( x / ka - band ) and optical links ( based on laser communication terminals ) connect the two segments and allow precise time - and - frequency transfer . 
 the space - segment encompasses the satellite , the two instruments , the science link equipment , and the precise orbit determination equipment . 
 the ground - segment is composed of 3 ground terminals that are connected to highly accurate ground - clocks . in order to fulfil the mission objectives , 
 various measurement types are used that are shown in fig.[fig : measurement_principle ] . 
 we shall briefly discuss them . 
 _ earth gravitational red - shift measurements : _ the frequency output of the on - board clock is compared to that of the ground clocks . in order to maximize the signal , i.e. the relativistic frequency offset between the two clocks , a highly elliptical orbit ( heo ) is chosen . 
 when the spacecraft is close to earth during perigee passage , there are large frequency shifts of the space - clock due to the strong gravitational field . when it is far from earth during apogee passage , there are only small gravitational fields and therefore small frequency shifts . whilst measurement type ( a ) compares the space - clock at apogee to the ground - clock , relying on space - clock accuracy , measurement type ( b ) compares the frequency variation of the space - clock over the elliptical orbit , which requires clock stability in addition to visibility of a ground terminal at perigee ( see also section [ sec : orbit_ground ] ) .    , scaledwidth=100.0% ] 
 + _ sun gravitational red - shift measurements : _ the relativistic frequency offset between a pair of ground clocks is compared while the spacecraft merely serves as a link node between the ground clocks for a period of typically 5 to 7 hours , as described by measurement type ( c ) . in that case , the accuracy of the space - clock is of minor importance whereas link stability and performance over a long period are essential . as 
 this requirement is also hard to fulfil by the microwave links alone , the optical links play an important role . 
 however , availability and performance of optical links are strongly affected by weather conditions which in turn depend on the location and altitude of the ground terminals . 
 + _ moon gravitational red - shift measurements : _ as in the preceding case , the relativistic frequency offset between a pair of ground clocks is compared while the spacecraft merely serves as a link node between the ground clocks . 
 the potential signals for a violation of the eep with the moon as the source mass can be easily distinguished from those with the sun as the source mass due to the difference in frequency and phase . 
 it is important to point out that unless the eep is violated the measured frequency difference between two distant ground clocks ( due to the sun or the moon ) is expected to be zero up to small tidal corrections and a constant offset term from the earth field@xcite . 
 + _ atom interferometer measurements : _ these measurements do not require contact to ground terminals but must be performed in close proximity to earth where the gravity gradients are large and the etvs parameter ( see eq.[equ : otvos ] below ) becomes small . 
 the latter defines the magnitude of a possible violation of the weak equivalence principle ( wep ) , as required for mission objective 4 . for this reason , the atom interferometer operates during perigee passage at altitudes below 3000 km , where gravity accelerations exceed @xmath6 . 
 the ste - quest payload primarily consists of two instruments , the atomic clock and the atom interferometer , as well as equipment for the science links ( microwave and optical ) and for precise orbit determination ( pod ) . whilst a detailed description of the proposed payload elements 
 is found in @xcite , here we shall only give a brief overview over the payload as summarized in table [ tab : payload ] . 
 note that some payload elements , such as the optical links and the onboard clock , may become optional in a future implementation of ste - quest , which is discussed in the official esa assessment study report ( yellow book)@xcite .

 _ is essentially a rebuilt of the high - precision pharao clock used in the aces mission@xcite , with the additional provision of an optically derived microwave signal ( mw ) for superb short term stability which is generated by the molo . in pharao 
 , a cloud of cold caesium atoms is prepared in a specific hyperfine state and launched across a vacuum tube . 
 there , the cloud is interrogated by microwave radiation in two spatially separated ramsey zones before state transition probabilities are obtained from fluorescence detection . repeating the cycle 
 while scanning the mw fields yields a ramsey fringe pattern whose period scales inversely proportional to the flight time t between ramsey interactions .    in the molo , a reference laser 
 is locked to an ultra - stable cavity , which provides superb short - term stability in addition to the long - term stability and accuracy obtained from pharao by locking the reference signal to the hyperfine transition of the caesium atoms . 
 the reference laser output is frequency - shifted to correct for long term drifts and then fed to the femtosecond frequency comb@xcite to convert the signal from the optical to the microwave - domain . 
 core components of the molo , such as the highly stable cavity@xcite , the frequency comb@xcite , and optical fibres @xcite are currently being developed or tested in dedicated national programs . 
 additionally , other components of optical clocks have been investigated in the ongoing space - optical - clock program ( soc)@xcite of the european space agency . 
 + _ the atom interferometer_@xcite uses interference between matter waves to generate an interference pattern that depends on the external forces acting on the atoms under test . in order to reject unwanted external noise sources as much as possible , 
 differential measurements are performed simultaneously with two isotopes of rubidium atoms , namely @xmath7 and @xmath8 . 
 the measured phases for both isotopes are subtracted to reveal any possible differences in acceleration under free fall conditions of the particles . 
 this way , the common mode noise which is present on both signals is rejected to a high degree@xcite . in the proposed instrument 
 @xcite a number of the order of @xmath9 atoms of both isotopes are trapped and cooled by means of sophisticated magnetic traps in combination with laser cooling . 
 thus , the residual temperature and consequently the residual motion and expansion of the atomic clouds is reduced to the nk regime , where the cloud of individual atoms makes the transition to the bose - einstein condensed state . 
 the atoms are then released from the trap into free fall before being prepared in superpositions of internal states and split into partial waves by pulses of lasers in a well defined time sequence . by using a sequence of 3 laser pulses separated by a period of @xmath10 , a mach - zehnder interferometer in space - time 
 is formed . 
 the distribution of the internal atomic states is then detected either by fluorescence spectroscopy or by absorption imaging . 
 the distribution ratio of the internal atomic states provides the information about the phase shift which is proportional to the acceleration acting on the atoms . 
 the etvs parameter @xmath11 ( see mission objective 4 ) depends on the ratio of inertial mass @xmath12 to gravitational mass @xmath13 for the two isotopes and can be found from the measured accelerations @xmath14 as follows : @xmath15 where subscript 1 refers to physical parameters of the first isotope ( @xmath7 ) and subscript 2 to those of the second isotope ( @xmath8 ) . 
 + the programmatics of european space atom interferometers , as proposed for ste - quest strongly builds on the different national and european - wide activities in this direction , in particular the space atom interferometer ( sai)@xcite and the nationally funded projects quantus@xcite and ice@xcite . in these activities innovative technologies are developed and tested in parabolic flights , drop tower campaigns and sounding rocket missions . 
 + _ the science links _ comprise optical and microwave time & frequency links to compare the on - board clock with distributed ground clocks . 
 similarly , the links allow to compare distant ground clocks to one another using the on - board segment as a relay . 
 the microwave link ( mwl ) is designed based on re - use and further development of existing mwl technology for the aces mission@xcite , while implementing lessons learned from aces . 
 this applies to the flight segment and the ground terminals , as well as for science data post - processing issues down to the principles and concept for deploying and operating a network of ground terminals and associated ground clocks . 
 digital tracking loops with digital phase - time readout are used to avoid beat - note concepts . 
 different to aces and given the highly eccentric orbit , ka - band is used instead of ku - band , x - band instead of s - band for ionosphere mitigation , and the modulation rate is changed from 100 mchip / s to 250 mchip / s . 
 the mwl flight segment comprises four receive channels to simultaneously support comparisons with 3 ground terminals and on - board calibration . 
 the optical link baseline design relies on two tesat laser communication terminals ( lcts)@xcite on - board the satellite , both referenced to the space - clock molo signal , and the ground lcts to perform two time bi - directional comparisons . 
 the lcts operate at 1064 nm with a 5 w fiber laser , similar to the edrs lct@xcite , and a 250 mhz rf modulation . 
 a telescope aperture of 150 mm in space and 300 mm on ground was chosen . 
 a preliminary performance estimate has been made by extrapolation from existing measurements with more detailed investigations following now in dedicated link studies . 
 the optical links are found to be particularly sensitive to atmospheric disturbances and local weather conditions . 
 these particularly affect common view comparisons between two ground terminals which are typically located in less favorable positions concerning local cloud coverage . + _ the precise - orbit - determination ( pod ) equipment _ is required to determine the spacecraft position and velocity , which allows calculating theoretical predictions of the expected gravitational red - shifts and the relativistic doppler , and compare them to the measured ones . 
 our studies found that a gnss - receiver with a nadir - pointing antenna suffices to achieve the required accuracy@xcite . 
 additional corner - cube reflectors to support laser ranging measurements , such as also used for the giove - a satellite@xcite , may optionally be included as a backup and for validation of gnss - derived results . 
 _ the baseline orbit _ is highly elliptical with a typical perigee altitude of 700 km and an apogee altitude of 50000 km , which maximizes gravity gradients between apogee and perigee in order to achieve mission objective 1 ( earth gravitational red - shift ) . 
 the corresponding orbit period is 16h , leading to a 3:2 resonance of the ground track as depicted in fig.[fig : orbit ] left . 
 some useful orbit parameters are summarized in tab . 
 [ tab : baseline_orbit ] . 
 llllll perigee alt . & apogee alt . & orbit period & inclination & arg . 
 perigee & raan drift + 700 - 2200 km & @xmath16 50 000 km&16  h & @xmath17 & @xmath18 & @xmath19 +    contrary to the old baseline orbit@xcite , where the argument of perigee was drifting from the north to the south during the mission , the argument of perigee for the new baseline orbit is frozen in the south . therefore , contact to the ground terminals located in the northern hemisphere can only be established for altitudes higher than 6000 km , which considerably impairs the modulation measurements of the earth gravitational red - shift ( measurement type b in table[tab : mission_objectives ] ) . on the pro side , for higher altitudes and in particular around apogee , common view links to several terminals and over 
 many hours can be achieved which greatly benefits the sun gravitational red - shift measurements ( type c ) . 
 the baseline orbit also features a slight drift of the right - ascension of the ascending node ( raan ) due to the @xmath20 term of the non - spherical earth gravitational potential@xcite , which leads to a total drift of approximately 30@xmath21 per year . 
 this drift being quite small , the orbit can be considered as nearly - inertial during one year so that seasonal variations of the incident solar flux are expected ( see also fig.[fig : solar_flux ] ) . 
 the major advantage of the new baseline orbit over the old one is a greatly reduced @xmath22v for de - orbiting , which allows reducing the corresponding propellant mass from 190 kg to 60 kg . 
 the reason for that is the evolution of the perigee altitude due to the 3-body interaction with the sun and the moon@xcite . 
 the perigee altitude starts low at around 700 km , goes through a maximum of around 2200 km at half time , and then drops back down below 700 km in the final phase , as depicted in fig.[fig : orbit ] right . 
 the low altitude at the end of mission facilitates de - orbiting using the 6 x 22-n oct thrusters during an apogee maneuver that is fully compliant with safety regulations .         + _ the ground segment _ comprises 3 ground terminals , each equipped with microwave antennas for x- and ka - band communication as well as ( optional ) optical terminals based on the laser communication terminals ( lct ) of tesat@xcite . 
 the terminals must be distributed over the earth surface with a required minimum separation of five thousand kilometers between them . 
 this maximizes their relative potential difference in the gravitational field of the sun in pursuit of mission objective 2 . 
 additionally , the terminals must be in the vicinity of high - performance ground clocks ( distance @xmath23 km ) to which they may be linked via a calibrated glass - fibre network . 
 this narrows the choice of terminal sites to the locations of leading institutes in the field of time - and frequency metrology . 
 factoring in future improvements in clock technology and design , those institutes are likely able to provide clocks with the required performance of a fractional frequency uncertainty on the order of @xmath24 ) at the start of the mission , considering that current clock performance comes already quite close to the requirement@xcite . 
 accounting for all the aspects mentioned above , boulder ( usa ) , torino ( italy ) , and tokyo ( japan ) were chosen as the baseline terminal locations . 
 the spacecraft has an octagonal shape with a diameter of 2.5 m and a height of 2.7 . 
 it consists of a payload module ( plm ) , accommodating the instruments as well as science link equipment , and a service module ( svm ) for the spacecraft equipment and propellant tanks ( see fig . 
 [ fig : spacecraft_overview ] ) . the laser communication terminals ( lcts ) 
 are accommodated towards the nadir end of opposite skew panels . 
 the nadir panel ( + z - face ) accommodates a gnss antenna and a pair of x - band / ka - band antennas for the science links . the telemetry & tele - commanding ( tt&c ) x - band low gain and medium gain antennas 
 are accommodated on y - panels of the service module . 
 the two solar array wings are canted at @xmath25 with respect to the spacecraft y - faces and allow rotations around the y - axis . 
 radiators are primarily placed on the + x/-x faces of the spacecraft and good thermal conductivity between dissipating units and radiators is provided through the use of heat - pipes which are embedded in the instrument base - plates . 
 a set of 2 x 4 reaction control thrusters ( rcts ) for orbit maintenance and slew maneuvers after the perigee measurement phase is used as part of the chemical propulsion system ( cps ) together with 1 x 6 orbit control thrusters ( octs ) for de - orbiting . 
 the latter is becoming a stringent requirement for future mission designs to avoid uncontrolled growth of space debris and reduce the risk of potential collisions between debris and intact spacecraft@xcite . 
 the micro - propulsion system ( mps ) is based on gaia heritage@xcite and primarily used for attitude control , employing a set of 2x8 micro - proportional thrusters to this purpose . as primary sensors of the attitude and orbit control subsystem ( aocs ) , 
 the spacecraft accommodates 3 star trackers , 1 inertial measurement unit ( imu ) , and 6 coarse sun sensors .    the payload module of fig . 
 [ fig : payload_module ] shows how the two instruments are accommodated in the well protected central region of the spacecraft , which places them close to the center - of - mass ( com ) and therefore minimizes rotational accelerations whilst also providing optimal shielding against the massive doses of radiation accumulated over the five years of mission duration . 
 the pharao tube of the atomic clock is aligned with the y - axis . 
 this arrangement minimizes the coriolis force which acts on the cold atomic cloud propagating along the vacuum tube axis when the spacecraft performs rotations around the y - axis . 
 these rotations allow preserving a nadir - pointing attitude of the spacecraft as required for most of the orbit ( see also section [ sec : aocs ] ) . 
 the sensitive axis of the atom interferometer must point in the direction of the external gravity gradient . 
 it is therefore aligned with the z - axis ( nadir ) and suspended from the spacecraft middle plate into the structural cylinder of the service module which provides additional shielding against radiation and temperature variations . 
 the total wet mass of the spacecraft with the launch adapter is approximately 2300 kg , including unit maturity margins and a 20% system margin . 
 the total propellant mass ( cps+mps ) is 260 kg , out of which 60 kg are reserved for de - orbiting . 
 the total power dissipation for the spacecraft is 2230 w , including all required margins , if all instruments and payload units operate at full power . 
 the spacecraft is designed to be compatible with all requirements ( including launch mass , envelope , loads , and structural frequencies ) for launch with a soyuz - fregat from the main esa spaceport in kourou . 
 the two instruments pose stringent requirements on attitude stability and non - gravitational accelerations which drive the design of the attitude and orbit control system ( aocs ) and the related spacecraft pointing strategy . to ensure full measurement performance 
 , the atom interferometer requires non- gravitational center - of - mass accelerations to be below a level of @xmath26 . among the external perturbations acting on the spacecraft and causing such accelerations , air drag is by far the dominant one . 
 it scales proportional to the atmospheric density and therefore decreases with increasing altitudes . 
 figure [ fig : drag_and_rotation ] ( left ) displays the level of drag accelerations for various altitudes and under worst case assumptions , i.e. maximal level of solar activity and maximal cross section offered by the spacecraft along its trajectory . 
 the results indicate that below altitudes of approximately 700 km drag accelerations become intolerably large . 
 we conclude that , for the baseline orbit , drag forces are generally below the required maximum level and therefore need not be compensated with the on - board micro - propulsion system , although such an option is feasible in principle .        another requirement is given by the maximal rotation rate of @xmath27 during perigee passage when sensitive atom interferometry experiments are performed . 
 figure [ fig : drag_and_rotation ] ( right ) plots the spacecraft rotation rate ( black solid line ) against the time for one entire orbit , assuming a nadir - pointing strategy . 
 the plot demonstrates that the requirement ( red broken line ) would not only be violated by the fast rotation rates encountered at perigee , even for the comparatively slow dynamics at apogee the rotation rates would exceed the requirement by more than one order of magnitude . 
 we therefore conclude that atom interferometer measurements are incompatible with a nadir - pointing strategy throughout the orbit , requiring the spacecraft to remain fully inertial during such experiments . considering that atom interferometry is generally performed at altitudes below 3000 km 
 , the following spacecraft pointing strategy was introduced for ste - quest ( see figure [ fig : pointing_strategy ] ) :        * * perigee passage : * for altitudes below 3000 km , lasting about @xmath28 each orbit , the atom interferometer is operating and the spacecraft remains inertial . 
 the atom interferometer axis is aligned with nadir at perigee and rotated away from nadir by 64 degrees at 3000 km altitude ( see figure [ fig : pointing_strategy ] ) . 
 the solar array driving mechanism is frozen to avoid additional micro - vibrations . * * transition into apogee : * for altitudes between 3000 km and 7000 km , right after the perigee passage , the spacecraft rotates such that it is nadir pointed again ( slew maneuver ) . 
 the solar arrays are unfrozen and rotated into optimal view of the sun . * 
 * apogee passage : * for altitudes above 7000 km the spacecraft is nadir pointed and rotational accelerations are generally much slower than during perigee passage . the solar array is allowed to rotate continuously for optimal alignment with the sun . 
 atom interferometer measurements are generally not performed . * * transition into perigee : * for altitudes between 7000 km and 3000 km , right after the apogee passage , the spacecraft rotates such that it is aligned with nadir at perigee . 
 the solar arrays are frozen .    during the science operations at perigee and apogee 
 , the attitude control relies solely on the mps . 
 the slew maneuvers , i.e. @xmath29 pitch rotations , are performed by means of the cps in @xmath30 at a rate of @xmath31 . 
 the cps is also used to damp out residual rotational rates which are caused by solar array bending modes and fuel sloshing due to the fast maneuvers . when the perigee passage is entered , the mps is activated to further attenuate the residual rate errors coming from the minimum impulse bit and sensor bias ( ca . 
 @xmath32 ) , which is shown in fig.[fig : rate_errors]b . 
 closed - loop simulations , based on a dynamical computer model of the spacecraft in - orbit and simulated aocs equipment , demonstrated that the damping requires about 500 s. the complete transition , including maneuvers , lasts about @xmath33 . in order to mitigate the effects of external disturbances during the perigee passage 
 , an aocs closed - loop control has been designed that is based on cold - gas thrusters and includes roll - off filtering to suppress sensor noise while maintaining sufficient stability margins . 
 this allows compensating external torques from drag forces , solar radiation pressure and the earth magnetic field ( among others ) , yielding rotation rates well below the required @xmath27 after the initial damping time of approximately @xmath34 s , as can be seen in in fig.[fig : rate_errors]b . 
 the associated mean relative pointing error ( rpe ) is found to be smaller than @xmath35 in a 15 s time window corresponding to one experimental cycle . 
 note that the spacecraft rotation rates grow to intolerably large levels of several hundred @xmath36 , if the spacecraft is freely floating without control loops to compensate the environmental torques ( see fig.[fig : rate_errors]a ) . 
 for orbit maintenance and de - orbiting , use of the cps is foreseen . 
 is outside the plot scale.,scaledwidth=100.0% ]      the problems associated with micro - vibrations lie at the heart of two key trades for our current spacecraft configuration . 
 one major cause of micro - vibrations are reaction wheels . to investigate the option of using them instead of the mps for attitude control , extensive simulations were performed with a finite element model of the spacecraft which provided the transfer functions from the reaction wheels to the atom interferometer interface . 
 based on this model and available measurement data of low - noise reaction wheels ( bradford w18e ) , the level of micro - vibrations seen at instrument interface could be compared against the requirements . 
 the results of the analyses are summarized in fig . 
 [ fig : micro_vibrations ] left which clearly shows a violation of the requirement for frequencies above 20 hz within the measurement band [ 1 mhz , 100 hz ] . 
 the major contribution to the micro - vibrations comes from the h1 harmonic when the disturbance frequency corresponds to the wheel rotation rate up to the maximum wheel rate of 67 hz . 
 further micro - vibrations are induced by the amplification of solar array flexible modes through the wheel rotation . 
 the violation of the requirement for the maximum level of tolerable micro - vibrations when using reaction - wheels , as found from our simulations , lead us to use a micro - propulsion system for attitude control in our baseline configuration .    } $ ] . 
 note that for ease of comparison , requirements for the spectral density have been transformed into rms requirements by integrating over the measurement bandwidth.,scaledwidth=100.0% ]    similar analyses were performed to determine the micro - vibrations induced by the solar array driving mechanism ( sadm ) on the molo interface , where a complex model of the sadm stepper motor together with the spacecraft finite - element - model ( fem ) with deployed solar arrays was combined in a matlab simulink environment . 
 the stepper motor generates two kinds of torque perturbations , one relating to the magnetic detent effect and the other relating to the commanded micro - stepping of the motor . 
 one particular resonance of the spacecraft structural model , corresponding to a torsional mode of the solar arrays around their rotation axis ( y - axis ) , was found to be the most critical one . 
 when this resonance was hit by a harmonic disturbance originating from the detent torque of the solar arrays driving mechanism , the resulting response displayed a low - frequency isolated resonance peak at the excitation frequency of 1.3 hz , with a few more peaks at higher frequencies due to harmonic excitation from the micro - stepping ( see fig . 
 [ fig : micro_vibrations ] right ) . restricting the solar array rotation rates to below 0.13 
 deg / s , the level of micro - vibrations is found to be fully compliant throughout the specified frequency range , as can be seen in figure [ fig : micro_vibrations ] . allowing for higher rates up to 0.08 deg / s , which are required to follow the fast spacecraft rotations with the solar array at low altitudes below 10000 km , we find that only one specific rotation rate at 0.044 deg / s leads to a violation of the requirement . 
 however , this is easily mitigated by quickly moving over the resonance , therefore avoiding to rotate the solar arrays at this particular rate .      for earth gravitational red - shift measurements of type ( a ) , 
 the measured frequency shift of the space - clock with respect to a ground clock is compared to the predicted frequency - shift . in order to compute the theoretical prediction , 
 it is necessary to know the precise position and velocity of the space - clock ( and therefore the precise orbit ) , as both quantities enter the equation describing the de - phasing of the space - clock proper time @xmath37 with respect to the coordinate time @xmath38 , where the latter is referenced to an inertial earth - centered coordinate system . 
 this dependence is expressed in eq.[equ : proper_time ] , which is derived from a post - newtonian expansion to second order in @xmath39 @xcite . 
 @xmath40 where @xmath41 denotes the gravitational potential , @xmath42 the spacecraft position , and @xmath43 its velocity . 
 note that the first term in brackets corresponds to the gravitational time dilation whereas the second term corresponds to the special relativistic time dilation . 
 + _ clock and link uncertainty : _ considering only the gravitational time dilation , the frequency shift @xmath44 between a space clock at apogee and a ground clock may then be written as @xmath45/c^2=6.2\times10^{-10}$ ] , where @xmath46 and @xmath47 are the earth radius and the radial distance to apogee , respectively . 
 it follows that the space - clock and the science links must have a fractional frequency uncertainty of better than @xmath48 to allow measuring the gravitational red - shift of the earth to the specified accuracy . from similar deliberations 
 one finds that the ground clock and science link performance must be even better , on the order of @xmath24 , to measure the gravitational red - shift of the sun to the specified accuracy . 
 this requires very long contact times between the spacecraft and ground terminals , on the order of @xmath49 , which is only achieved after integration over many orbits . 
 + the above requirements can be directly translated into the required stability for the link , expressed in modified allan deviation@xcite , and into the frequency uncertainty for a space - to - ground or ground - to - ground comparison . 
 a detailed performance error budget was established to assess all contributions to potential instabilities . 
 for the microwave links we found that , provided the challenging requirements for high thermal stability are met , the aces design with the suggested improvements can meet the specifications . 
 the assessment of the optical links showed that a significantly better performance than the state - of - the - art is required . 
 a major issue for further investigation is the validity of extrapolating noise power spectral densities over long integration times in presence of atmospheric turbulence , which is required for comparing the estimated link performance to the specified link performance expressed in modified allan deviation . + _ orbit uncertainty : _ as the fractional frequency uncertainty is specified to be around @xmath48 for the space - clock , a target value of @xmath50 for the orbit uncertainty does not compromise the overall measurement accuracy . 
 although preliminarily a constant target value of 2 m in position and 0.2 mm / s in velocity accuracy has been derived in @xcite , these values can be significantly relaxed at apogee@xcite . 
 a final analysis will have to build on a relativistic framework for clock comparison as outlined in @xcite . 
 + _ gnss tracking : _ the proposed method of precise orbit determination ( pod ) relies on tracking gps and galileo satellites with a gnss receiver supporting all available modulation schemes , e.g. bpsk5 , bpsk10 and mboc@xcite , and an antenna accommodated on the nadir panel . considering that gnss satellites broadcast their signal towards the earth and not into space , they become increasingly difficult to track at altitudes above their constellation ( 20200 km altitude ) , when the spacecraft can only receive signals from gnss satellites behind the earth . in order to increase the angular range of signal reception , 
 the receiver is required to support signal side - lobe tracking . 
 this way , a good signal visibility for six hours during each orbit and for altitudes up to 34400 km can be achieved , with a corresponding pvt ( position - velocity - time ) error of 1.7 m at 1 hz output rate@xcite . 
 the transition maneuvers split the visibility region ( green arch in fig . 
 [ fig : gnss_visibility ] ) into separate segments , which must be considered separately in the orbit determination . for both regions 
 we find orbit errors less than 10 cm in position and less than 0.2 mm / s in velocity . 
 extrapolation of the spacecraft trajectory from the end of the visibility arch as far as apogee introduces large orbit errors ( @xmath51 ) due to large uncertainties in parameters describing the solar radiation pressure . 
 nonetheless , these errors are sufficiently small to achieve the specified frequency uncertainty for the space - clock measurement if one considers the arguments for relativistic clock comparison derived in @xcite . a brief discussion of the possibility to relax the ste - quest orbit accuracy close to apogee is also given in @xcite .    finally , it shall be pointed out , that the accuracies obtained from gnss - based pod are sufficient to probe the flyby anomaly , an inexplicable momentum transfer which has been observed for several spacecraft careening around the earth . 
 these investigations can be performed without further modifications to the baseline hardware or mission concept , as described in ref . 
 the major focus of the assessment study was to define preliminary designs of the spacecraft subsystems in compliance with all mission requirements . 
 to this end , key aspects such as pointing strategy of spacecraft and solar arrays , variability of solar flux and temperature stability , measurement performance and pointing stability , instrument accommodation and radiative shielding , and launcher specifications , among others , must be reflected in the custom - tailored design features . 
 additional provisions for ease of access during integration and support of ground - based instrument testing on spacecraft level are also important considerations . 
 as we intend to give a concise overview in this paper , we will limit our discussion on a few distinctive design features . 
 + _ thermal control subsystem ( tcs ) : _ the ste - quest payload dissipates a large amount of power which may total up to more than 1.7 kw ( including maturity and system margins ) if all payload equipment is active . 
 this represents a major challenge for the thermal system which can only be met through dedicated heat - pipes transporting the heat from the protected accommodation region in the spacecraft center to the radiator panels . 
 also problematic is the fact that the baseline orbit is not sun - synchronous and features a drift of the right - ascension of the ascending node ( raan ) , which leads to seasonally strongly variable thermal fluxes incident on the spacecraft from all sides . 
 this is mitigated by optimal placement of the radiators in combination with a seasonal yaw - rotation by @xmath52 to minimize the variability of the external flux on the main radiators . 
 the variation of the thermal flux during the 6 years of mission is plotted in fig.[fig : solar_flux ] ( left ) . 
 the time when the largest temperature fluctuations occur during one orbit , defined as the maximum temperature swing , is close to the start of the mission and coincides with the time of the longest eclipse period . 
 the additional use of heaters in proximity to the various payload units allows us to achieve temperature fluctuations of the payload units of less than @xmath53c , whilst average operating points consistently lie within the required range from @xmath54c to @xmath55c . during periods when only a minimum of solar flux is absorbed by the spacecraft , e.g. cold case of fig.[fig : solar_flux ] 
 , the heaters of the thermal control system may additionally contribute up to 150 w to the power dissipation . 
 these results were found on the basis of a detailed thermal model of the spacecraft implemented with esatan - tms , a standard european thermal analysis tool for space systems@xcite . 
 + _ electrical subsystem & communications : _ similar to the tcs , the design of the electrical subsystem is driven by the highly variable orbit featuring a large number of eclipses ( more than 1800 during the mission with a maximum period of 66 minutes ) , the high power demand of the instruments , and the satellite pointing strategy in addition to the required stability of the spacecraft power bus . in order to meet the power requirements , two deployable solar arrays at a ca 
 nt angle of 45 degrees are rotated around the spacecraft y - axis . 
 this configuration , in combination with two yaw - flips per year , ensures a minimum solar flux of approximately @xmath56 on the solar panels ( see fig.[fig : solar_flux ] right ) , which generates a total power of 2.4 kw , including margins . 
 the option of using a 2-axis sadm has also been investigated in detail and could be easily implemented . 
 however , it is currently considered too risky as such mechanisms have not yet been developed and qualified in europe and they might cause problems in relation to micro - vibrations .    as far as telemetry and tele - commanding ( tt&c ) is concerned , contact times to a northern ground station ( cebreros ) are close to 15 h per day on average for the baseline orbit , which is easily compliant with the required minimum of 2 h per day . 
 this provides plenty of margin to download an estimated 4.4 gbit of data using a switched medium gain antenna ( mga ) and low gain antenna ( lga ) x - band architecture which is based on heritage from the lisa pathfinder mission@xcite . 
 the switched tt&c architecture allows achieving the required data volume at apogee on the one hand , whilst avoiding excessive power flux at perigee to remain compliant with itu regulations on the other hand . 
 + _ mechanical subsystem , assembly integration and test ( ait ) and radiation aspects : _ the spacecraft structure is made almost entirely from panels with an aluminum honeycomb structure ( thickness 40 mm ) and carbon - fibre reinforced polymer ( cfrp ) face sheets , which is favorable from a mechanical and mass - savings perspective . 
 a detailed analysis based on a finite - element - model ( fem ) of the spacecraft structure revealed a minimum eigenfrequency of 24 hz in transverse and 56 hz in axial direction , well above the launcher requirements of 15 hz and 35 hz , respectively . 
 the first eigenmode of the atom interferometer physics package , corresponding to a pendulum mode in radial direction , was found at 67 hz . 
 the spacecraft structure is designed to optimize ait and aspects of parallel integration . to this end 
 , the two instruments can be integrated and tested separately before being joined on payload module level without the need to subsequently remove any unit or harness connection . 
 the heat - pipe routing through the spacecraft structure allows functional testing of both instruments on ground by operating the heat - pipes either in nominal mode or re - flux mode ( opposite to the direction of gravity ) . as an important feature in the integration process 
 , payload and service module components are completely separated in their respective modules up to the last integration step , when they are finally joined and their respective harness connected on easily accessible interface brackets . 
 the second major aspect in structural design and instrument accommodation has been to minimize radiation doses of sensitive instrument components . 
 as the spacecraft crosses the van allen belt twice per orbit and more than 5000 times during the mission , it sustains large radiation doses from trapped electrons and solar protons . 
 dedicated design provisions and protected harness routing ensure that the total ionizing doses ( tids ) are below 30 krad for all instrument units and below 5 krad for the sensitive optical fibres . the non - ionizing energy loss , which is primarily caused by low - energy protons , is found to be well below @xmath57 , expressed in terms of 10 mev equivalent proton fluence . 
 these results were obtained from the total dose curves accumulated over the orbit during the mission in combination with a dedicated sectoring analysis performed with a finite - element - model of the spacecraft . 
 ste - quest aims to probe the foundations of einstein s equivalence principle by performing measurements to test its three cornerstones , i.e. the local position - invariance , the local lorentz - invariance and the weak equivalence principle , in a combined mission . 
 it complements other missions which were devised to explore the realm of gravity in different ways , including the soon - to - be - launched aces@xcite and microscope@xcite missions and the proposed step@xcite mission . 
 the ste - quest measurements are supported by two instruments . 
 the first instrument , the atomic clock , benefits from extensive heritage from the aces mission@xcite , which therefore reduces associated implementation risks . 
 the other instrument , the atom interferometer , would be the first instrument of this type in space and poses a major challenge which is currently met by dedicated development and qualification programs . 
 the mission assessment activities summarized in this paper yielded a spacecraft and mission design that is compliant with the challenging demands made by the payload on performance and resources . 
 several critical issues have been identified , including low maturity of certain payload components , potential unavailability of sufficiently accurate ground clocks , high sensitivity of the optical links to atmospheric distortions and associated performance degradation , and high energy dissipation of the instruments in addition to challenging temperature stability requirements . 
 however , none of these problems seems unsurmountable , and appropriate mitigation actions are already in place .

"pulsed high - frequency ( hf ) electromagnetic ( em ) waves from transmitters on the ground are regularly used for sounding the density profile and drift velocity of the overehead ionosphere [ _ hunsucker _ , 1991 ; _ reinisch et al . 
 _ , 1995 , _ reinisch _ , 1996 ] . 
 in 1971 , it was shown theoretically by _ perkins and kaw _ [ 1971 ] that if the injected hf radio beams are strong enough , weak - turbulence parametric instabilities in the ionospheric plasma of the type predicted by _ silin _ [ 1965 ] and _ dubois and goldman _ [ 1965 ] would be excited . 
 ionospheric modification experiments by a high - power hf radio wave at platteville in colorado [ _ utlaut _ , 1970 ] , using ionosonde recordings and photometric measurements of artificial airglow , demonstrated the heating of electrons , the deformation in the traces on ionosonde records , the excitation of spread @xmath0 , etc . 
 , after the hf transmitter was turned on . the triggering of weak - turbulence parametric instabilities in the ionosphere 
 was first observed in 1970 in experiments on the interaction between powerful hf radio beams and the ionospheric plasma , conducted at arecibo , puerto rico , using a scatter radar diagnostic technique [ _ wong and taylor _ , 1971 ; _ carlson et al . 
 _ , 1972 ] . 
 a decade later it was found experimentally in troms that , under similar experimental conditions as in arecibo , strong , systematic , structured , wide - band secondary hf radiation escapes from the interaction region [ _ thid et al . _ , 1982 ] . 
 this and other observations demonstrated that complex interactions , including weak and strong em turbulence , [ _ leyser _ , 2001 ; _ thid et al . _ , 2005 ] and harmonic generation [ _ derblom et al . _ , 1989 ; _ blagoveshchenskaya et al . _ , 
 1998 ] are excited in these experiments . 
 numerical simulations have become an important tool to understand the complex behavior of plasma turbulence . 
 examples include analytical and numerical studies of langmuir turbulence [ _ robinson _ , 1997 ] , and of upper - hybrid / lower - hybrid turbulence in magnetized plasmas [ _ goodman et al . _ , 1994 ; _ xi _ , 2004 ] . in this letter , we present a full - scale simulation study of the propagation of an hf em wave into the ionosphere , with ionospheric parameters typical for the high - latitude eiscat heating facility in troms , norway . to our knowledge , this is the first simulation involving realistic scale sizes of the ionosphere and the wavelength of the em waves . 
 our results suggest that such simulations , which are possible with today s computers , will become a powerful tool to study hf - induced ionospheric turbulence and secondary radiation on a quantitative level for direct comparison with experimental data . 
 we use the mks system ( si units ) in the mathematical expressions throughout the manuscript , unless otherwise stated . 
 we assume a vertically stratified ion number density profile @xmath1 with a constant geomagnetic field @xmath2 directed obliquely to the density gradient . 
 the em wave is injected vertically into the ionosphere , with spatial variations only in the @xmath3 direction . 
 our simple one - dimensional model neglects the em field @xmath4 falloff ( @xmath5 is the distance from the transmitter ) , the fresnel pattern created obliquely to the @xmath3 direction by the incident and reflected wave , and the the influence on the radio wave propagation due to field aligned irregularities in the ionosphere . 
 for the em wave , the maxwell equations give @xmath6 @xmath7 where the electron fluid velocity is obtained from the momentum equation @xmath8\ ] ] and the electron density is obtained from the poisson equation @xmath9 . 
 here , @xmath10 is the unit vector in the @xmath3 direction , @xmath11 is the speed of light in vacuum , @xmath12 is the magnitude of the electron charge , @xmath13 is the vacuum permittivity , and @xmath14 is the electron mass . 
 ms.,scaledwidth=48.0% ]    the number density profile of the immobile ions , @xmath15 $ ] ( @xmath3 in kilometers ) is shown in the leftmost panel of fig . 
 [ fig1 ] . instead of modeling a transmitting antenna via a time - dependent boundary condition at @xmath16 km 
 , we assume that the em pulse has reached the altitude @xmath17 km when we start our simulation , and we give the pulse as an initial condition at time @xmath18 s. in the initial condition , we use a linearly polarized em pulse where the carrier wave has the wavelength @xmath19 ( wavenumber @xmath20 ) corresponding to a carrier frequency of @xmath21 ( @xmath22 ) . 
 the em pulse is amplitude modulated in the form of a gaussian pulse with a maximum amplitude of @xmath23 v / m , with the @xmath24-component of the electric field set to @xmath25\sin(0.1047\times 10^{3 } z)$ ] ( @xmath3 in kilometers ) and the @xmath26 component of the magnetic field set to @xmath27 at @xmath18 . 
 the other electric and magnetic field components are set to zero ; see fig .  [ 
 the spatial width of the pulse is approximately 30 km , corresponding to a temporal width of 0.1 milliseconds as the pulse propagates with the speed of light in the neutral atmosphere . 
 it follows from eq . 
 ( 1 ) that @xmath28 is time - independent ; hence we do not show @xmath28 in the figures . 
 the geomagnetic field is set to @xmath29 tesla , corresponding to an electron cyclotron frequency of 1.4 mhz , directed downward and tilted in the @xmath30-plane with an angle of @xmath31 degrees ( @xmath32 rad ) to the @xmath3-axis , i.e. , @xmath33 . in our numerical simulation , we use @xmath34 spatial grid points to resolve the plasma for @xmath35 km . 
 the spatial derivatives are approximated with centered second - order difference approximations , and the time - stepping is performed with a leap - frog scheme with a time step of @xmath36  s. 
 the splitting of the wave is due to faraday rotation.,scaledwidth=48.0% ]     ms . 
 b ) a closeup of the region of the turning points of the r - x and l - o modes . 
 we see that the wave - energy of the l - o mode is concentrated into one single half - wave envelop at @xmath37 km , while the turning point of the less localized r - x mode is at @xmath38 km.,scaledwidth=48.0% ]     ms . 
 b ) a closeup of the region of the turning points of the r - x and l - o modes . here , the l - o mode oscillations at @xmath37 km are radiating em waves with perpendicular ( to the @xmath3 axis ) electric field components.,scaledwidth=48.0% ]    in the simulation , the em pulse propagates without changing shape through the neutral atmosphere , until it reaches the ionospheric layer . at time @xmath39 
 ms , shown in fig . 
 [ fig2 ] , the em pulse has reached the lower part of the ionosphere . the initially linearly polarized em wave undergoes faraday rotation due to the different dispersion properties of the l - o and r - x modes ( we have adopted the notation `` l - o mode '' and `` r - x mode '' for the two high - frequency em modes , similarly as , e.g. , _ goertz and strangeway _ [ 1995 ] ) in the magnetized plasma , and the @xmath40 and @xmath41 components are excited . at @xmath42 ms , shown in fig . 
 [ fig3 - 4 ] , the l - o and r - x mode pulses are in the vicinity of their respective turning points , the turning point of the l - o mode being at a higher altitude than that of the r - x mode ; see panel a ) of fig . 
 [ fig3 - 4 ] . 
 a closeup of this region , displayed in panel b ) , shows that the first maximum of the r - x mode is at @xmath38 km , and the one of the l - o mode is at @xmath37 km . 
 the maximum amplitude of the r - x mode is @xmath43 
 v / m while that of the l - o mode is @xmath44 v / m ; the latter amplitude maximum is in agreement with those obtained by _ thid and lundborg _ , [ 1986 ] , for a similar set of parameters as used here . 
 the electric field components of the l - o mode , which at this stage are concentrated into a pulse with a single maximum with a width of @xmath45 m , are primarily directed along the geomagnetic field lines , and hence only the @xmath46 and @xmath47 components are excited , while the magnetic field components of the l - o mode are very small . at @xmath48 ms , 
 shown in panel a ) of fig . 
 [ fig5 - 6 ] , both the r - x and l - o mode wave packets have widened in space , and the em wave has started turning back towards lower altitudes . in the closeup of the em wave in panel b ) of fig .  [ fig5 - 6 ] 
 , one sees that the l - o mode oscillations at @xmath37 km are now radiating em waves with significant magnetic field components . finally , shown in fig . 
 [ fig7 ] at @xmath49 , the em pulse has returned to the initial location at @xmath17 km . due to the different reflection heights of the l - o and r - x modes , the leading ( lower altitude ) part of the pulse is primarily r - x mode polarized while its trailing ( higher altitude ) part is l - o mode polarized . in the center of the pulse , where we have a superposition of the r - x and l - o mode , 
 the wave is almost linearly polarized with the electric field along the @xmath26 axis and the magnetic field along the @xmath24 axis . 
 the direction of the electric and magnetic fields here depends on the relative phase between the r - x and l - o mode .

 we also show the low - frequency electron whistler branch in panel d).,scaledwidth=50.0% ]     at the altitude @xmath50 km , and b ) of @xmath46 at the altitude @xmath51 km.,scaledwidth=48.0% ]    in fig . 
 [ fig8 - 9 ] , panel a ) , we have plotted the electric field component @xmath47 at @xmath50 km , near the turning point of the r - x mode and in panel b ) we have plotted the @xmath46 component at @xmath51 km , near the turning point of the l - o mode . 
 we see that the maximum amplitude of @xmath47 reaches @xmath58 v / m at @xmath59 ms , and that of @xmath46 reaches @xmath60 v / m at @xmath61 ms . 
 the electric field amplitude at @xmath50 km has two maxima , due to the l - o mode part of the pulse , which is reflected at the higher altitude @xmath51 km and passes twice over the altitude @xmath50 km . 
 we also observe weakly damped oscillations of @xmath46 at @xmath51 km for times @xmath62 ms , which decrease exponentially in time between @xmath63 ms and @xmath64 ms as @xmath65 with @xmath66 s@xmath67 . 
 we found from the numerical values that @xmath68 , where @xmath69 is the inverse ion density scale length at @xmath70 km , but we are not certain how general this result is . 
 no detectable magnetic field fluctuations are associated with these weakly damped oscillations , and we interpret them as electrostatic waves that have been produced by mode conversion of the l - o mode . 
 the amplitudes of the @xmath47 and @xmath40 components are also much weaker than that of the @xmath46 component for these oscillations . 
 a closeup of these electrostatic oscillations at @xmath54 ms is displayed in panel c ) of fig . 
 [ fig8 - 9 ] , where we see that they have a wavelength of approximately 33 m ( wavenumber @xmath71 ) . in panel d ) of fig . 
 [ fig8 - 9 ] , we have plotted the frequency @xmath72 as a function of the wavenumber @xmath73 , where @xmath74 is obtained from the appleton - hartree dispersion relation [ _ stix _ , 1992 ] @xmath75 here @xmath76^{1/2}$ ] , @xmath77 ( @xmath78 ) is the electron plasma ( cyclotron ) frequency , and @xmath79 is the angle between the geomagnetic field and the wave vector @xmath80 , which in our case is directed along the @xmath3-axis , @xmath81 . 
 we use @xmath82 ( corresponding to @xmath83 mhz ) , @xmath84 ( corresponding to @xmath85 mhz ) and @xmath57 rad . 
 the location of the electrostatic waves whose wavelength is approximately 33 m and frequency 5 mhz is indicated with circles in the diagram ; they are on the same dispersion surface as the langmuir waves and the upper hybrid waves / slow z mode waves with propagation parallel and perpendicular to the geomagnetic field lines , respectively . 
 the mode conversion of the l - o mode into electrostatic oscillations are relatively weak in our simulation of vertically incident em waves , and theory shows that the most efficient linear mode conversion of the l - o mode occurs at two angles of incidence in the magnetic meridian plane , given by , e.g. , eq . 
 ( 17 ) in [ _ mjlhus _ , 1990 ] . 
 the nonlinear effects at the turning point of the l - o and r - x modes are investigated in fig . 
 [ fig10 ] which displays the frequency spectrum of the electric field component @xmath47 at the altitude @xmath86 km and of @xmath46 at the altitude @xmath51 km . 
 the spectrum shows the large - amplitude pump wave at 5 mhz and the relatively weak second harmonics of the pump wave at 10 mhz at both altitudes ( the slight downshift is due to numerical errors produced by the difference approximations used in space and time ) . 
 visible are also low - frequency oscillations ( zeroth harmonic ) due to the nonlinear down - shifting / mixing of the high - frequency wave field . 
 in conclusion , we have presented a full - scale numerical study of the propagation of an em wave and its linear and nonlinear interactions with an ionospheric layer . 
 we observe the reflection of the l - o and r - x modes at different altitudes , the mode conversion of the l - o mode into electrostatic langmuir / upper hybrid waves as well as nonlinear harmonic generation of the high - frequency waves . 
 second harmonic generation have been observed in ionospheric heating experiments [ _ derblom et al .

"the mott - hubbard model of interacting bosons on a lattice has been used to describe superfluid mott - insulator transitions in a variety of systems , e.g. , josephson arrays and granular superconductors @xcite . 
 the recent suggestion @xcite to experimentally observe this transition in a system of cold bosonic atoms in an optical lattice and its successful experimental demonstration @xcite has rekindled the interest in the mott - insulator transition and triggered a great deal of theoretical @xcite and experimental @xcite activity . the possibility to directly manipulate and test the many - body behavior of a system of 
 trapped bosonic atoms in an optical lattice @xcite is very attractive . 
 possible applications include the use of a mott state of bosonic atoms in an optical lattice as a starting point to create controlled multiparticle entanglement as an essential ingredient for quantum computation @xcite    the mott - insulator quantum phase transition is driven by the interplay of the repulsive interaction of bosons on the same lattice site and the kinetic energy . 
 hence the ratio of the onsite energy and the bandwidth forms the key parameter in the system . in optical lattices , this parameter can be easily controlled and varied by several orders of magnitude , enabling detailed studies of the quantum phase transition . 
 probing the system by taking absorption pictures to image the expansion patterns after a reasonable expansion time yields information about the momentum distribution of the state . 
 this procedure was used to experimentally confirm the mott transition in an optical lattice @xcite .    the essential physics of cold bosonic atoms in an optical lattice is captured by a bosonic mott - hubbard model describing the competition between hopping and on - site interaction . 
 a number of approximation schemes have been used to study this model analytically @xcite as well as numerically , using approaches like the gutzwiller mean - field ansatz @xcite , density - matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) @xcite , exact diagonalization ( ed)@xcite and quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) @xcite .    in this article , we study the short - range correlations , not included by the gutzwiller ansatz , by using perturbation theory . the main purpose is to find corrections to the short - range behavior of the one - particle density matrix , which is directly relevant to experimentally observed expansion patterns . 
 these patterns are important for determining the location of the insulator - superfluid transition . 
 we note that in the insulating state our perturbative approach is identical to the one used in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) , although there the goal was different , viz . , studying corrections to the phase diagram . 
 the remainder of the article is organized as follows : in section [ modsec ] , we will introduce the model and its mean - field solution . the general perturbative approach is briefly outlined in section [ secpa ] , while details may be found in the appendix . 
 numerical results are presented and discussed in section [ secnr ] , first for local observables ( [ secslso ] ) and then for the density matrix ( [ secrho ] ) . 
 implications for expansion patterns both for bulk systems and a harmonic confining potential are discussed in section [ harmotrap ] . 
 the cold bosonic gas in the optical lattice can be described by a mott - hubbard model @xcite @xmath0 here , @xmath1 is the total number of lattice sites , @xmath2 ( @xmath3 ) creates ( annihilates ) a boson on site @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 is the on - site repulsion describing the interaction between bosons on the same lattice site , and @xmath7 denotes the chemical potential . 
 the kinetic term includes only hopping between nearest - neighbor sites , this is denoted by the summation index @xmath8 ; @xmath9 is the hopping matrix element that we will assume to be lattice - site independent . 
 finally , @xmath10 describes an external on - site potential that is commonly present in experiments . 
 the gutzwiller ( gw ) approach is based on an ansatz for the many - body ground state that factorizes into single lattice - site wavefunctions @xmath11    the gutzwiller wavefunction represents the ground state of the following mean - field version of the mott - hubbard hamiltonian , eq . 
 ( [ motthubb ] ) : @xmath12 here @xmath13 is the mean - field potential on the @xmath4-th lattice site , which is self - consistently defined as the expectation value of @xmath3 in terms of the gutzwiller wavefunction , @xmath14 @xcite . 
 using the gutzwiller ansatz to obtain an approximate variational solution for the mott - hubbard hamiltonian ( [ motthubb ] ) corresponds , however , to restricting the hilbert space to the subset of product states . 
 consequently , even in higher dimensions , this ansatz fails to describe the correct behavior of short - range correlations between different lattice sites , which are important for experimentally measurable observables , such as expansion patterns ( momentum distributions ) . nevertheless , in the thermodynamic limit and higher dimensions , the gutzwiller wavefunction provides a good approximation in the limits of @xmath15 and @xmath16 ( i.e. , deep in the mott insulator ( mi ) and superfluid ( sf ) phases ) . 
 to get a satisfactory description of the short - range correlations we will now derive perturbative corrections to the gutzwiller mean - field result . 
 our aim is to start from the gutzwiller approximation and improve it by perturbatively including the short - range correlations between lattice sites . 
 we re - express the mott - hubbard hamiltonian ( [ motthubb ] ) by adding the appropriate perturbation to the mean - field hamiltonian , eq . 
 ( [ mf ] ) : @xmath17 with @xmath18 as the mean - field hamiltonian represents a sum of single lattice - site hamiltonians , the excited states @xmath19 and the excitation spectrum @xmath20 can be obtained numerically for each lattice site @xmath4 separately . hence we can write the excitations of @xmath21 as product states of single lattice - site excitations , @xmath22 and the excitation spectrum as a sum over the single lattice - site excitation energies , @xmath23 where @xmath24 describes the set of quantum numbers characterizing the given many - body energy eigenstate .    having obtained the mean - field solution from the gutzwiller ansatz , we can now proceed to improve our wavefunction performing rayleigh - schrdinger perturbation theory @xcite in @xmath25 : @xmath26 where @xmath27 and @xmath28 are the @xmath29-th order corrections to the wavefunction and grand - canonical energy @xmath30 , respectively .    knowing the excited wavefunctions , eq . 
 ( [ es ] ) , and the excitation spectrum , eq . 
 ( [ esp ] ) , perturbative corrections to observables can be calculated explicitly . 
 the resulting expressions up to second order in @xmath25 , which we use in the following , are derived and illustrated diagrammatically in appendix [ appendixa ] . 
 we start by computing the gutzwiller wavefunction numerically using a conjugate - gradient descent method . 
 propagation steps of the time - dependent gutzwiller equations @xcite in imaginary time are performed to test whether the minimum found by the conjugate - gradient descent method is indeed the ground state . 
 afterwards , we calculate eigenenergies and -vectors of each site , with respect to the mean - field hamiltonian . as explained above , this forms the basis for perturbation theory , which we use to calculate the corrections to the observables up to second order . 
 the results obtained from perturbation theory show important modifications to single - site observables as well as to the correlation function . 
 these observables are composed of operators acting only on single lattice sites . 
 hence , they describe local properties and will be less sensitive to the correlations between lattice sites . 
 thus , values for single - site observables obtained from the gutzwiller wavefunction already provide a good approximation in most cases ( unless fluctuations are concerned ) . 
 ( diamonds ) , @xmath31 ( triangles ) , and @xmath32 ( squares ) dimensions . 
 the dashed - dotted lines in fig . 
 [ slso]a - c are the gutzwiller results . 
 ( a ) number fluctuations @xmath33 calculated for a commensurate filling of one boson per lattice site . 
 the dashed line shows the result from the exact diagonalization for 7 lattice sites and @xmath34 bosons . 
 ( b ) order parameter @xmath35 and ( c ) compressibility @xmath36 both computed at a fixed chemical potential @xmath37 . 
 [ slso],width=302 ]    the leading corrections to the mean values of single lattice - site observables ( slso ) are of second order in @xmath25 . 
 the results for the order parameter @xmath38 , the compressibility @xmath36 and the number fluctuations @xmath39 are shown in fig . 
 [ slso ] , where the ration @xmath40 has been scaled by the dimension , to keep the same mean - field transition point . 
 the solid lines in fig . 
 [ slso ] show the results from perturbation theory , as compared to the gutzwiller result ( shown as the dashed  -  dotted line ) . 
 all three quantities show a vanishing perturbative correction both for small and large @xmath40 , as the gutzwiller wavefunction becomes a good approximation in these regimes ( for lattice dimensions @xmath41 ) 
 . as expected , deviations from the mean - field picture are strongest near the mi - sf transition , where higher - order corrections will become more and more important . 
 the order parameter @xmath42 shown in fig . 
 [ slso]b gets suppressed in the sf . 
 perturbative corrections to the gutzwiller result are particularly large in 1d ( where the order parameter vanishes in reality ) , but get smaller with increasing dimension . 
 this is not surprising , as gutzwiller is a mean - field approach and hence a better approximation for higher - dimensional systems . 
 the critical value @xmath43 is not modified within the present perturbative approach . 
 figure  [ slso]c shows the results for the compressibility    @xmath44    the results of perturbation theory ( pt ) show a decrease of the compressibility , pointing to an increasing stiffness of the sf phase induced by the short - range interaction .    finally , we computed the local particle number fluctuations @xmath45 . 
 exact diagonalization calculations have shown that the number fluctuations are changing smoothly at the mi - sf transition @xcite , whereas the gutzwiller result predicts vanishing fluctuations in the mi phase , @xmath46 ( see dashed - dotted line in fig .  [ 
 our perturbative results reproduce the non - vanishing part of @xmath39 in the mi regime and agree well with our result obtained from exact diagonalization of a one - dimensional system of @xmath47 lattice sites . 
 significant deviations from the exact 1d result are seen in the mi - sf transition regions , starting from the mean - field critical value , @xmath48 , up to values of the order of the critical values of @xmath49 usually obtained from dmrg @xcite and qmc @xcite calculations . 
 nevertheless , based on the good agreement of our perturbative result with the exact diagonalization for a large region in the mi , we conclude that the number fluctuations are mainly produced by next - neighbor particle - hole fluctuations included in perturbation theory . 
 the single - particle density matrix @xmath50 is of particular importance as it describes the correlation between the different lattice sites . 
 the correlation function @xmath51 shows off - diagonal long - range order in the sf state ( in dimensions @xmath41 ) , in contrast to the mi phase where @xmath51 decays exponentially . 
 the experimental observation @xcite of the mi transition relies on the different behavior of the density matrix in the mi and sf regimes , which can be visualized by taking absorption pictures of the freely expanding atomic cloud . assuming that the expansion time is long enough and that the gas is dilute enough ( such that atom - atom interactions can be neglected during the expansion ) , the shape of the cloud reflects the initial momentum distribution @xmath52 , which is directly given by the fourier - transform of the density matrix @xmath51 : @xmath53     as a function of site distance @xmath54 . 
 results for a homogeneous lattice of 7 sites with @xmath34 bosons have been obtained from exact diagonalization ( ed ) , from second - order perturbation theory ( pt ) , and from the gutzwiller mean - field ansatz ( gw ) . 
 ( a ) @xmath55 ( mi regime ) , ( b ) @xmath56 , ( c ) @xmath57 , ( d ) @xmath58 ( deep sf regime ) . 
 all calculations use periodic boundary conditions . 
 the mean - field value @xmath43 for the mi transition in the commensurate case with one boson per lattice site is @xmath48 in 1d ( see fig . 
 [ slso ] ) . 
 ( the mf value differs strongly from @xmath59 derived from qmc calculations @xcite or @xmath60 for dmrg calculations @xcite ) . 
 [ vgled],width=302 ]    here , @xmath61 is the fourier transform of the wannier functions @xmath62 describing the wavefunction of a single lattice site . 
 the presence of the factor @xmath61 in eq . 
 ( [ fourier ] ) provides a cutoff at high momenta . 
 the mean - field results for @xmath51 only describe the different long - range behavior in the mi and sf . for a homogeneous lattice 
 the correlation function calculated from the gutzwiller wavefunction gives @xmath63 for the diagonal elements and then drops instantly to @xmath64 for all off - diagonal elements @xmath65 . 
 short - range correlations are not reproduced by the gutzwiller approach . 
 this deviation is particularly severe in the mi , where the mean - field result predicts a completely flat momentum distribution , whereas the short - range correlations ( i.e. the exponential decay of @xmath51 ) yield smooth bumps in the expansion pattern . these can be distinguished from the @xmath66-peaks of the sf only after a sufficiently long expansion time . 
 applying perturbation theory to the gw wavefunction improves the structureless gw correlation function . in fig . 
 [ vgled ] , we have compared the results of gw mean - field theory , of pt , and of exact diagonalization ( ed ) . 
 the diagonalization has been carried out for a small 1d lattice , where it is easily feasible . 
 although there is no long - range order in the sf phase for the 1d case , where the density matrix exhibits a power - law decay towards zero , it is still reasonable to compare the short - range correlations . 
 indeed , we find a nice agreement between perturbation theory and exact results , not only for the mi ( see fig . 
 [ vgled]a ) , but also for the short - range behavior in the sf . 
 this agreement is made possible by the fact that @xmath51 decays only slowly and higher - order corrections show only negligible corrections for small lattices . 
 an example for the sf case is shown in fig . 
 [ vgled]d . 
 however , there is still a considerable difference for @xmath67 in fig . 
 [ vgled]d . 
 this is not surprising as we do pt up to second order . 
 hence correlations over a distance of three and more lattice sites are only corrected by the global mean - field correction for the infinite lattice ( see eq . 
 ( [ cpsione ] ) , eq . 
 ( [ cpsitwo ] ) , and fig . 
 [ 2ndcpsi ] in appendix [ appendixa ] ) . 
 we expect better agreement for larger lattice sizes as finite - size effects , arising in small lattices , are still considerable for @xmath68 sites used in our ed calculations .    finally , for intermediate values of @xmath40 , shown in fig . 
 [ vgled]b , c , we observe a faster drop in the off - diagonal correlations , such that higher - order contributions in the pt become more important . 
 in any dimension , the perturbation @xmath25 is no longer small at the tip of the mi - sf transition lobe ( fig .  [ vgled]c ) , and the pt breaks down . 
 nevertheless , comparing with exact diagonalization results , fig . 
 [ vgled]b shows still good agreement with ed , in contrast to fig . 
 [ vgled]c , which shows clear disagreement . 
 even though the parameters @xmath57 chosen for fig . 
 [ vgled]c are close to the mi - sf transition for 1d - lattices ( as predicted by dmrg @xcite and qmc @xcite calculations ) , pt reproduces the correct slope for the off - diagonal decay and lacks only the wrong offset from the mean field . 
 thus , even for this case , pt represents a qualitative improvement on the gutzwiller result . 
 the results for both approximations , gutzwiller and pt , are expected to become better in higher dimensions ( with the perturbative corrections diminishing in size ) .     in second - order pt as a function of @xmath69 and @xmath40 . 
 the order parameter @xmath70 vanishes inside the mott - insulating lobes , whose mean - field boundaries are given by the white dashed line .

 the gray - scales of plots belonging to the same parameter set are identical . 
 expansion patterns ( a),(b),(d),and ( e ) are normalized to the peak maximum ; ( c ) and ( f ) are normalized to @xmath81 of the peak maximum.[expans ] , width=302 ]    as discussed before , the perturbative enhancement of the description of short - range correlations is expected to lead to strong consequences for the momentum distributions . as an example we discuss a set of momentum distributions @xmath71 for a homogeneous 2d lattice , fig . 
 [ expans]a - f , and compare the gutzwiller results to those improved by pt . 
 the improved pt versions , figs . 
 [ expans]d - f , show much finer structures than the mean - field results , fig . 
 [ expans]a - c . 
 pt predicts broad peaks in the mi regions down to very small values of @xmath40 , fig . 
 [ expans]e , whereas the gutzwiller result without pt shows a structureless flat distribution for the whole mi region , fig . 
 [ expans]a , b . naturally , the modifications of @xmath71 are strongest near the phase transition , figs . 
 [ expans]a and [ expans]d . 
 going towards larger values @xmath40 into the sf phase , pt gives rise to a suppression of the peaks ( inset in fig . 
 [ expans]c , f ) 
 . this suppression can be larger than @xmath82 of the original peak height and stems from the corrections to the mean field . 
 additionally , fig . 
 [ expans]f shows broad peaks induced by the inclusion of short - range correlations . 
 however , for large lattices , these broad peaks are small compared to the ( finite - size broadened ) sf @xmath66-peaks .       on a plane through the trap center for a 3d lattice with @xmath83 lattice sites .

 ( b ) difference between pt and gw results . 
 [ expans3d],title=""fig:"",width=264 ]    in contrast to what was assumed in the last section , optical lattices used in experiments are not homogeneous . magnetic or optical trapping potentials are used @xcite to confine the atomic gas to a finite volume .    the inhomogeneity caused by the trapping potential leads to slowly varying on - site energies , @xmath10 , in the mott - hubbard model eq . 
 ( [ motthubb ] ) , that can be interpreted as a spatially varying chemical potential @xmath91 . 
 consequently the lattice is in general not in a pure mi or sf phase , but shows alternating shells of sf and mi regions . 
 an example for a sf region surrounded by a mi shell is shown in fig . 
 [ spd]b .    considering the slowly varying on - site energy as 
 a spatially varying chemical potential gives a qualitative understanding of the shell structures . 
 the spatial variation of the chemical potential corresponds to a path parallel to the @xmath69 axis in the @xmath69-@xmath40-diagram . 
 starting with the potential minimum , in the trap center , and then moving off the center , decreases the effective local chemical potential . whenever a mi - sf ( sf - mi ) phase boundary is hit along the path in the @xmath69-@xmath40-diagram , a change from a mi to a sf ( sf to mi ) 
 shell appears . 
 the inclusion of short - range correlations gives rise to considerable modifications also in the presence of an inhomogeneous trapping potential . 
 examples , calculated for a 3d - lattice , are shown in fig . 
 [ expans3d ] , where an underlying harmonic potential @xmath92 was chosen . 
 the three situations considered here correspond to a case with a large mi fraction ( fig .  [ spd]a ) , a sf island surrounded by a mi shell ( fig . 
 [ spd]b ) , and a mi island surrounded by a sf phase ( fig . 
 [ spd]c ) . calculating the expansion patterns for these situations , fig . 
 [ expans3d ] , shows that the perturbative corrections arising from the short - range correlations lead to substantially different behavior in the different cases .    for the almost complete mi state we get a correction to all wavevectors @xmath93 , with a fast drop at values close to the peak center @xmath94 , which leads to a peak broadening in the expansion picture ( see circles in fig .  [ expans3d ] ) . 
 particularly large changes were found for the case of a sf island surrounded by a mi phase , fig . 
 [ expans3d ] ( squares ) . 
 again , corrections arise for all wavevectors , but , in contrast to the almost homogeneous case , the largest increase is now found for @xmath94 , with changes of about @xmath82 of the peak - maximum .    finally , the reversed situation , a mi island surrounded by a sf phase ( diamonds in fig .  [ expans3d ] ) does not show an increase of its maximum peak height but a considerable reduction ( over 5% of the peak maximum ) . 
 this is not surprising , as the majority of the lattice sites are now contributing to the sf phase , and a peak reduction was also observed for the bulk sf phase . 
 we would now like to compare our approach with the results obtained by kashurnikov _ 
 @xcite , who used qmc calculations to calculate expansion patterns for a small 3d lattice with harmonic confinement . 
 there is good qualitative agreement in all cases with high superfluid fraction ( compare for example fig .

 @xcite ) . however , the features of these expansion patterns are already well reproduced using the gutzwiller mean - field ansatz alone , in particular , the satellite peak , which was discussed as a signature of the mi - sf shell structure in @xcite . 
 corrections arising from pt show a suppression of the sf peak , as was discussed above .    however , there are also considerable discrepancies to the qmc results for situations with a large mi fraction , even after implementing second - order pt . in these cases ( fig . 
 [ kash]c(d ) and fig . 
 2d(e ) in ref . 
 @xcite ) , the influence of the mi phase on the expansion picture broadens the peak and leads to a homogeneous background . the discrepancies to the qmc 
 are clearly visible in fig . 
 [ kash]c showing no peak broadening and a sattelite peak in contrast to the qmc results ( fig.2d in @xcite ) . 
 including the short range correlations perturbatively corrects the expansion pattern in the right direction , giving rise to a suppression of the sf - peak . considering the expansion pattern with the clearest mi features ( fig  [ kash]d and fig . 
 2e in ref . 
 @xcite ) , we obtain the correct peak broadening from gw / pt calculation , but a larger ratio of mi background to sf peak . 
 concerning these discrepancies , we note that the expansion pattern is highly sensitive to the value of the mean field . 
 even small deviations can lead to a change in the sf - peak height sufficient to mask the flat distribution of the mi phase . 
 we checked , however , that the observed discrepancy is not due to a lack in accuracy of our numerical calculations . 
 we therefore believe that the discrepancies between qmc and gw / pt for situations with a large mi fraction can be attributed to the insufficiency of gw and low - order pt in describing the long - range correlations in this inhomogeneous situation . 
 in addition , we note that the lattice employed in @xcite is comparatively small for the given harmonic confinement potential ( with no complete shell of empty sites at the perimeter , see insets of fig . 
 [ kash ] ) , i.e. , the choice of boundary conditions ( periodic in the case of our numerical calculations ) may have non - negligible effects on the outer lattice sites .    ) for a system of @xmath95 lattice sites considered in @xcite .

 we have used perturbation theory to incorporate the effects of short - range correlations on top of the mean field solution of the bosonic mott hubbard model . 
 we derived corrections to local quantities , as well as to observable expansion patterns . 
 we numerically calculated the corrections to the mf - result , using pt up to second order , thus including correlations between next and next - nearest lattice sites . 
 modifications to the particle number fluctuations @xmath39 , arising from the pt , gave rise to the expected smooth transition of @xmath39 at the mi - sf transition . 
 moreover , comparing the pt results to the ed results for @xmath39 in 1d lattices showed good agreement for small values of @xmath40 . 
 of particular importance are the corrections to the correlation function , and thus to the expansion patterns . 
 we compared the correlation function obtained from pt with calculations from ed for small 1d - lattices and found good agreement . studying 
 the expansion patterns showed that the inclusion of the short - range correlations to the mf - ansatz gives rise to distinct modifications . 
 a broad peak can be seen in the pt results for the mi regime , visible even down to small values of @xmath40 . comparing pt and mf expansion patterns obtained for parameters in the sf region displayed a considerable suppression of the sf peak in the pt results . 
 additionally , on approaching the sf - mi transition from the sf side , broad peaks underlying the sf peaks were found in the pt - expansion patterns . including a harmonic confinement potential leads to situations where sf and mi regions coexist . 
 hence the perturbative corrections to the expansion pattern become more complex . 
 we studied lattices with different underlying harmonic traps giving rise to different constellations of sf - mi regions , finding modifications of up to @xmath82 of the peak maximum in the expansion patterns .

 lines two and three in eq . 
 ( [ perta ] ) are the second - order corrections to the mean value .      as an example we will discuss the corrections to the density matrix @xmath121 . 
 the first - order correction to the density matrix is : @xmath122 for two different lattice sites @xmath123 , we find @xmath124 since the gutzwiller ground state is a product state . as a consequence , 
 the contributions @xmath125 and @xmath126 vanish . 
 the only remaining contributions to @xmath127 stem from @xmath128 and @xmath129 .      the graph shows a decomposition of the matrix element , with each row showing the wavefunction at an intermediate step in the evaluation of the matrix element . 
 as we deal with product states @xmath130 we represent the wavefunction by a row of circles , where each circle denotes the state @xmath131 of a particular lattice site @xmath4 . 
 open circles in fig . 
 [ diagramm ] denote a lattice site in its ground state ( gs ) , filled circles refer to an excited state ( es ) of this particular lattice site , with respect to the local mean - field hamiltonian . 
 note that , in general , this can be an arbitrarily highly excited state ( although higher contributions are suppressed by the energy denominator , and a cutoff is used in practice ) . 
 starting with a row of open circles , denoting the gs , @xmath116 , each following row corresponds to the state after the action of @xmath25 or @xmath132 , as indicated on the left side of the graph . as all matrix elements in eq . 
 ( [ perta ] ) can be expressed in terms of a gs expectation value @xmath115 and a sequence of @xmath25 and @xmath132 operators , the first and last row must always be a line of open circles . 
 let us consider for instance the second term in eq . 
 ( [ firstorder ] ) @xmath133 reading the graph in fig . 
 [ diagramm ] from top to bottom corresponds to reading the matrix element from right to left . 
 starting with the gs , @xmath134 , the first row consists of open circles . 
 the second row shows the state after the action of the perturbation @xmath25 . 
 acting with @xmath135 to the right onto the gs results in a state latexmath:[\[v_{ij } |g_0\rangle = \sum_{\alpha,\beta } f_{\alpha,\beta }    @xmath112 are neighboring lattice sites and @xmath137 denotes the state with lattice site @xmath4 ( @xmath112 ) in the exited state @xmath138 ( @xmath139 ) and all other sites in their gs . 
 thus the second row shows the lattice sites @xmath4 and @xmath140 in an excited state ( filled circle ) , as the perturbation , eq . 
 ( [ pert ] ) , allows only next neighbor interactions . 
 finally , the action of @xmath132 has to bring the excited states back to the gs , in order to get a non - vanishing contribution . 
 therefore , in first order pt , only next neighbor corrections to the correlation function arise , as the final row must represent the ground state @xmath141 again . 
 the graph representing the remaining first term in eq .

"anomaly - mediated supersymmetry breaking ( amsb ) models have received much attention in the literature due to their attractive properties@xcite : the soft supersymmetry ( susy ) breaking terms are completely calculable in terms of just one free parameter ( the gravitino mass , @xmath11 ) , the soft terms are real and flavor invariant , thus solving the susy flavor and @xmath12 problems , the soft terms are actually renormalization group invariant@xcite , and can be calculated at any convenient scale choice . in order to realize the amsb set - up , the hidden sector must be `` sequestered '' on a separate brane from the observable sector in an extra - dimensional universe , so that tree - level supergravity breaking terms do not dominate the soft term contributions . 
 such a set - up can be realized in brane - worlds , where susy breaking takes place on one brane , with the visible sector residing on a separate brane . 
 the soft susy breaking ( ssb ) terms arise from the rescaling anomaly .    in spite of its attractive features , 
 amsb models suffer from the well - known problem that slepton mass - squared parameters are found to be negative , giving rise to tachyonic states . the original solution to this problem 
 is to suppose that scalars acquire as well a universal mass @xmath13 , which when added to the amsb ssb terms , renders them positive . 
 thus , the parameter space of the `` minimal '' amsb model ( mamsb ) is given by m_0 ,  m_3/2 ,  ,  sign ( ) . 
 an alternative set - up for amsb has been advocated in ref . 
 @xcite , known as hypercharged anomaly - mediation ( hcamsb ) . 
 it is a string motivated scenario which uses a similar setup as the one envisioned for amsb . in hcamsb , 
 susy breaking is localized at the bottom of a strongly warped hidden region , geometrically separated from the visible region where the mssm resides . 
 the warping suppresses contributions due to tree - level gravity mediation@xcite and the anomaly mediation@xcite can become the dominant source of susy breaking in the visible sector . 
 possible exceptions to this sequestering mechanism are gaugino masses of @xmath14 gauge symmetries  @xcite . 
 thus , in the mssm , the mass of the bino the gaugino of @xmath15 can be the only soft susy breaking parameter not determined by anomaly mediation@xcite . depending on its size 
 , the bino mass @xmath16 can lead to a small perturbation to the spectrum of anomaly mediation , or it can be the largest soft susy breaking parameter in the visible sector : as a result of rg evolution its effect on other soft susy breaking parameters can dominate the contribution from anomaly mediation . in extensions of the mssm , additional @xmath17s can also communicate susy breaking to the mssm sector  @xcite . 
 besides sharing the same theoretical setup , anomaly mediation and hypercharge mediation cure phenomenological shortcomings of each other . 
 the minimal amsb model predicts a negative mass squared for the sleptons ( and features relatively heavy squarks ) . on the other hand , 
 the pure hypercharge mediation suffers from negative squared masses for stops and sbottoms ( and features relatively heavy sleptons ) : see sec . 
 [ sec : pspace ] . as a result 
 , the combination of hypercharge and anomaly mediation leads to phenomenologically viable spectra for a sizable range of relative contributions  @xcite . 
 we parametrize the hcamsb ssb contribution @xmath18 using a dimensionless quantity @xmath2 such that @xmath19 so that @xmath2 governs the size of the hypercharge contribution to soft terms relative to the amsb contribution . 
 then the parameter space of hcamsb models is given by ,  m_3/2 ,  ,  sign ( ) . in the hcamsb model , we assume as usual that electroweak symmetry is broken radiatively by the large top - quark yukawa coupling . then the ssb @xmath20 term and the superpotential @xmath21 term are given as usual by the scalar potential minimization conditions which emerge from requiring an appropriate breakdown of electroweak symmetry . 
 in hcamsb , we take the ssb terms to be of the form : m_1 & = & _ 1+m_3/2,m_a & = & m_3/2 ,  a=2 ,  3  m_i^2 & = & -14\ { _ g+_f}m_3/2 ^ 2 a_f & = & m_3/2 , where @xmath22 , @xmath23 is the beta function for the corresponding superpotential coupling , and @xmath24 with @xmath25 the wave function renormalization constant . 
 the wino and gluino masses ( @xmath26 and @xmath27 ) receive a contribution from the bino mass at the two loop level . 
 thus , in pure hypercharge mediation , they are one loop suppressed compared to the scalar masses . 
 for convenience , we assume the above ssb mass parameters are input at the gut scale , and all weak scale ssb parameters are determined by renormalization group evolution .    we have included the above hcamsb model into the isasugra subprogram of the event generator isajet v7.79@xcite . after input of the above parameter set , 
 isasugra then implements an iterative procedure of solving the mssm rges for the 26 coupled renormalization group equations , taking the weak scale measured gauge couplings and third generation yukawa couplings as inputs , as well as the above - listed gut scale ssb terms . 
 isasugra implements full 2-loop rg running in the @xmath28 scheme , and minimizes the rg - improved 1-loop effective potential at an optimized scale choice @xmath29@xcite to determine the magnitude of @xmath21 and @xmath30 . 
 all physical sparticle masses are computed with complete 1-loop corrections , and 1-loop weak scale threshold corrections are implemented for the @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 yukawa couplings@xcite . 
 the off - set of the weak scale boundary conditions due to threshold corrections ( which depend on the entire superparticle mass spectrum ) , necessitates an iterative up - down rg running solution . 
 the resulting superparticle mass spectrum is typically in close accord with other sparticle spectrum generators@xcite .    once the weak scale sparticle mass spectrum is known , then sparticle production cross sections and branching fractions may be computed , and collider events may be generated . 
 then , signatures for hcamsb at the cern lhc may be computed and compared against standard model ( sm ) backgrounds . 
 our goal in this paper is to characterize the hcamsb parameter space and sparticle mass spectrum , and derive consequences for the cern lhc @xmath34 collider , which is expected to begin operation in fall , 2009 . 
 some previous investigations of mamsb at lhc have been reported in ref . 
 @xcite . 
 the remainder of this paper is organized as follows . in sec . 
 [ sec : pspace ] , we calculate the allowed parameter space of hcamsb models , imposing various experimental and theoretical constraints . 
 we also show sample mass spectra from hcamsb models , and show their variation with @xmath2 and @xmath11 . 
 we show typical values of @xmath35 and @xmath36 that result . in sec . 
 [ sec : lhc ] , we explore consequences of the hcamsb model for lhc sparticle searches . 
 typically , collider events are characterized by production of high @xmath37 @xmath32 and @xmath31 quarks , along with @xmath38 and observable tracks from late decaying charginos @xmath39 . for small @xmath2 
 , slepton pair production may be visible , while for large @xmath2 , direct @xmath40 and @xmath41 production may be visible . 
 the lhc reach for 100 fb@xmath3 should extend up to @xmath42 ( 105 ) tev , corresponding to a reach in @xmath43 ( 2.2 ) tev , for small ( large ) values of @xmath2 . 
 the hcamsb model should be easily distinguishable from the mamsb model at the lhc if @xmath6 is not too large , due to the presence of @xmath44 candidates in cascade decay events . 
 the presence of these reflects the mass ordering @xmath0 in the hcamsb model , while @xmath45 in the mamsb model . in sec . 
 [ sec : conclude ] , we present our conclusions and outlook for hcamsb models . 
 we begin our discussion by plotting out in fig . [ 
 fig : m10 ] the mass spectra of various sparticles versus _ a _ ) . 
 @xmath46 in mamsb and _ b _ ) . 
 @xmath2 in the hcamsb model , for @xmath11 fixed at 50 tev , while taking @xmath47 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 gev . for @xmath13 and @xmath50 
 , the yellow - shaded region yields the well - known tachyonic slepton mass - squared values , which could lead to electric charge non - conservation in the scalar potential . in mamsb , as @xmath13 increases , all the scalars increase in mass , while @xmath51 , @xmath52 and @xmath53 remain roughly constant , and the superpotential @xmath21 term decreases . 
 the large @xmath13 limit of parameter space is reached around @xmath54 , where ewsb is no longer properly broken ( signaled by @xmath55 ) . 
 we also see the well - known property of mamsb models that @xmath56 . 
 in addition , an important distinction between the two models is the mass ordering which enters into the neutralino mass matrix : we find typically that @xmath0 in the hcamsb model , while @xmath1 in mamsb . thus , both models will have a wino - like @xmath57 state . 
 however , in the hcamsb model , the @xmath58 are dominantly higgsino - like states , with @xmath59 being bino - like , while in the mamsb model , we expect @xmath60 to be bino - like with @xmath61 being higgsino - like . 
 this mass ordering difference will give rise to a crucial distinction in lhc susy cascade decay events ( see sec . 
 [ sec : lhc ] ) which may serve to distinguish the two models .    in the hcamsb case , as @xmath2 increases , the gut scale gaugino mass @xmath16 increases . 
 thus , the bino mass increases with @xmath2 , while the light charginos @xmath39 and neutralino @xmath57 remain wino - like with mass fixed near @xmath26 , and the gluino remains with mass fixed at nearly @xmath62 . 
 many of the scalar masses also vary with @xmath2 . 
 the reason is that as @xmath2 increases , so does the gut scale value of @xmath16 . 
 the large value of @xmath16 feeds into the scalar masses via their renormalization group equations , causing many of them to increase with @xmath2 , with the largest increases occurring for the scalars with the largest weak hypercharge assignments @xmath63 . 
 thus , we see strong increases in the @xmath64 , @xmath65 and especially the @xmath66 masses with increasing @xmath67 . 
 the @xmath68 squark only receives a small increase in mass , since its hypercharge value is quite small : @xmath69 . from fig . 
 [ fig : m10]_b _ ) . 
 , we already see an important distinction between mamsb and hcamsb models : in the former case , the @xmath65 and @xmath66 states are nearly mass degenerate , while in the latter case these states are highly split , with @xmath70 . 
 an exception to the mass increase with @xmath2 in fig . 
 [ fig : m10]_b _ ) . occurs in the values of @xmath71 and @xmath72 . in these cases , 
 the large increase in @xmath73 feeds into the rge @xmath74 term@xcite , and _ amplifies _ the top - quark yukawa coupling suppression of the @xmath75 term . 
 since the doublet @xmath76 contains both the @xmath77 and @xmath78 states , both of these actually suffer a _ decrease _ in mass with increasing @xmath2 . 
 thus , we expect in hcamsb models with moderate to large @xmath2 that the third generation squark states will be highly split . for large @xmath67 
 , we expect the light third generation squarks @xmath79 and @xmath80 to be quite light , with a dominantly left- squark composition 
 . the heavier squarks @xmath81 and @xmath82 will be quite heavy , and dominantly right - squark states . 
 in addition , we see from fig . [ fig : m10]_b _ ) . that the superpotential @xmath21 term _ decreases _ with increasing @xmath2 . 
 at moderate - to - large @xmath6 , the @xmath21 term is from the tree - level scalar potential minimization conditions @xmath83 . 
 the running of @xmath84 versus energy scale @xmath85 is shown in fig . 
 [ fig : mhu ] for @xmath86 and 0.195 . 
 we see that as @xmath2 increases , the value of @xmath87 actually decreases , leading to a small @xmath88 value . 
 the relevant rge reads = ( - g_1 ^ 2m_1 ^ 2 -3g_2 ^ 2m_2 ^ 2 + g_1 ^ 2 s+3f_t^2 x_t ) . 
 a large value of @xmath16 thus leads to an _ upwards _ push to @xmath84 in its early running from @xmath89 , which is only later compensated by the downward push of the yukawa - coupling term involving the top yukawa coupling @xmath90 . in the figure , for the case of @xmath91 , the weak scale value of @xmath84 is actually positive . upon adding the large 1-loop corrections to the effective potential ( due to the light top - squark ) , 
 the rg - improved scalar potential yields a positive value of @xmath88 . 
 thus , in the region of large @xmath2 , where @xmath21 becomes small and comparable to @xmath26 , we expect the neutralino @xmath57 to become a mixed wino - higgsino particle , and the corresponding @xmath92 mass gap to increase beyond the value @xmath93 mev which is expected in amsb models@xcite . 
 parameter as a function of energy scale @xmath85 for @xmath94 , @xmath95 and @xmath96 for @xmath97 tev and @xmath47 , @xmath48 in the hcamsb model . , 
 scaledwidth=50.0% ]    an interesting coincidence related to the rg evolution of @xmath84 in the limit where hypercharge mediation dominates is that the electroweak symmetry breaking _ requires _ the electroweak scale to be @xmath98 orders of magnitude below the scale @xmath99 ( @xmath99 may be of order the gut scale or string scale ) at which the bino mass @xmath16 is generated . 
 if the hierarchy between the electroweak scale and @xmath99 was smaller , then a susy breaking scenario in which hypercharge mediation dominates would not be capable of triggering ewsb ( the energy interval for rg evolution would not be large enough to drive the @xmath84 parameter to negative values ) . 
 this is a very uncommon feature among susy breaking scenarios .    for a more detailed comparison , 
 we list in table [ tab : cases ] the sparticle mass spectrum for a mamsb point with @xmath100 gev , @xmath97 tev , @xmath47 and @xmath48 , and two hcamsb points with small and large @xmath2 values equal to @xmath101 and @xmath96 . 
 while all three cases have a comparable gluino mass , we see that the rather small splitting amongst @xmath102 and also @xmath103 states in mamsb is turned to large left - right splitting in the hcamsb cases . 
 we also see that the @xmath104 mev mass gap in amsb and hcamsb1 which leads to long - lived and possibly observable @xmath105 tracks in collider detectors opens up to a few gev in the hcamsb2 case . 
 the latter mass gap is large enough to make the @xmath105 state less long lived , although still maintaining possibly measureable tracks in collider scattering events . 
 the value of @xmath106 versus @xmath2 is shown in fig . [ 
 fig : ctau ] , where we usually get @xmath107 mm for most @xmath2 values . 
 the value drops to shorter lengths for large @xmath2 . 
 the shorter travel time of the @xmath105 would distinguish the large @xmath2 hcamsb case with a mixed higgsino - wino @xmath57 state from the low @xmath2 hcamsb case where @xmath57 is instead nearly pure wino - like . 
 .masses and parameters in  gev units for three case study points amsb , hcamsb1 and hcamsb2 using isajet 7.79 with @xmath49 gev and @xmath48 . 
 we also list the total tree level sparticle production cross section in fb at the lhc . [ cols=""<,^,^,^"",options=""header "" , ] 
 in this paper , we have examined some phenomenological consequences of hypercharged anomaly - mediated susy breaking models at the lhc . 
 we have computed the expected sparticle mass spectrum , and mapped out the relevant parameter space of the hcamsb model . 
 we have computed sparticle branching fractions , production cross sections and expected lhc collider events , and compared against expectations for sm backgrounds . 
 our main result was to compute the reach of the lhc for hcamsb models assuming 100 fb@xmath3 of integrated luminosity . 
 we find an lhc reach to @xmath42 tev ( corresponding to @xmath43 tev ) for low values of @xmath2 , and a reach to @xmath108 tev ( corresponding to @xmath109 tev ) for large @xmath2 . 
 we expect the reach for @xmath110 to be similar to the reach for @xmath48 , due to similarities in the spectra for the two cases ( see fig . 
 [ fig : m10 ] . ) 
 we also expect the reach for large @xmath6 to be similar to the reach for low @xmath6 in the @xmath111 and @xmath112 channels ( differences in the multi - lepton channels can occur due to enhanced -ino decays to taus and @xmath32s at large @xmath6 ) . 
 the lhc reach for hcamsb models tends to be somewhat lower than the reach for mamsb models , where ref . 
 @xcite finds a 100 fb@xmath3 reach of @xmath113 tev for low values of @xmath13 . 
 this is due in part because , in mamsb , the various squark states are more clustered about a common mass scale @xmath13 , while in hcamsb the squark states are highly split , with @xmath114 . 
 the hcamsb lhc event characteristics suffer similarities and differences with generic mamsb models . 
 both hcamsb and mamsb give rise to multi - jet plus multi - lepton plus @xmath38 event topologies , and within these event classes , it is expected that occasional hits of length a few _ cm _ will be found , arising from production of the long - lived wino - like chargino states . 
 some of the major differences between the models include the following . 
 a severe left - right splitting of scalar masses is expected in hcamsb , while left - right scalar degeneracy tends to occur in mamsb . 
 this may be testable if some of the slepton states are accessible to lhc searches . 
 it is well known that in mamsb , @xmath56 , while in hcamsb , @xmath115 , since the @xmath66 state has a large weak hypercharge quantum number . 
 in addition , the lightest stau state , @xmath116 , is expected to be mainly a left- state in hcamsb , while it is mixed , but mainly a right- state in mamsb . while it is conceivable that the left - right mixing might be determined at lhc ( using branching fractions or tau energy distributions ) , 
 such measurements would be easily performed at a linear @xmath117 collider , especially using polarized beams@xcite .    in hcamsb models , 
 the light third generation squarks @xmath79 and @xmath80 are expected to be generically lighter than the gluino mass , and frequently much lighter . 
 this leads to cascade decays which produce large multiplicities of @xmath32 and @xmath31 quarks in the final state . 
 thus , in hcamsb models , a rather high multiplicity of @xmath32 jets is expected . in mamsb , 
 a much lower mutiplicity of @xmath32-jets is expected , although this depends also on the value of @xmath6 which is chosen .    in hcamsb models , 
 the @xmath14 gaugino mass @xmath16 is expected to be the largest of the gaugino masses , with a mass hierarchy of @xmath0 . 
 this usually implies that the @xmath59 neutralino is mainly bino - like , while @xmath60 and @xmath118 are higgsino - like , and @xmath57 is wino - like . 
 in contrast , in the mamsb model , usually the ordering is that @xmath1 , so that while @xmath57 is again wino - like , the @xmath60 state is bino - like , and @xmath118 and @xmath59 are higgsino - like . 
 the compositions of the @xmath119 for @xmath120 will not be easy to determine at lhc , but will be more easily determined at a linear @xmath117 collider . 
 however , the mass ordering gives rise to os dilepton distributions with a prominent @xmath121 peak in hcamsb , while such a peak should be largely absent in mamsb models ( except at large @xmath6 where there is greater mixing in the neutralino sector ) . 
 thus , cascade decay events containing hits along with a @xmath121 peak in the os dilepton invariant mass distribution may be a smoking gun signature for hcamsb models at the lhc , at least within the lower range of @xmath6 .

 this hypercharged anomaly - mediated susy breaking ( hcamsb ) model naturally solves the tachyonic slepton mass problem endemic to pure amsb scenarios . in hcamsb , 
 one obtains a mass ordering @xmath0 with split left- and right- scalars , whereas in mamsb models , one obtains @xmath1 with nearly degenerate left- and right- scalars . 
 we compute the allowed parameter space and expected superparticle mass spectrum in the hcamsb model . for low values of the hc and amsb mixing parameter @xmath2 , 
 the spectra is characterized by light left - sleptons , while the spectra for large @xmath2 is characterized by light top- and bottom- squarks . 
 we map out the approximate reach of lhc for hcamsb , and find that with 100 fb@xmath3 of integrated luminosity , a gravitino mass of @xmath4 ( 105 ) tev can be probed for low ( high ) values of @xmath2 , corresponding to a gluino mass reach of @xmath5 ( 2.2 ) tev . both cases 
 contain as is typical in amsb models long lived charginos that should yield visible highly ionizing tracks in the lhc detector . also , in the lower @xmath6 range , hcamsb models give rise to reconstructable @xmath7 candidates in susy cascade decay events , while mamsb models should do so only rarely .

"with the introduction of efficient multi - object spectrographs on 4m - class telescopes , it has become possible to construct large samples of faint galaxies with measured redshifts . 
 with such a sample , one can compute the luminosity function ( lf ) of galaxies as a function of redshift and thereby directly observe the evolution ( or lack thereof ) of the galaxy population . 
 several groups have now presented the results of deep , faint galaxy redshift surveys ( @xcite , cfrs ; @xcite , autofib ; @xcite ; @xcite , cnoc ) . 
 the conclusions from these surveys are in broad agreement : the population of blue , star - forming galaxies has evolved strongly since @xmath16 while the population of red galaxies shows at most modest signs of evolution ( although , see kauffmann , charlot , & white ( 1996 ) for an alternative analysis of the red galaxies ) . however , there are important differences as well . 
 lin et al . ( 1996a ) demonstrate that the lfs from the various groups are formally inconsistent with each other . 
 since there are many selection effects involved with the construction and analysis of faint redshift surveys , it is difficult to pinpoint the reasons for the disagreement between the various groups . 
 while it is likely that the small numbers of galaxies in each survey and the small areas covered are partly responsible , it is also likely that systematic errors are in important contributor to the differences in detail . 
 quantitative estimates of the evolution are , of course , dependent upon having a reliable measurement of the local lf , and it is , therefore , of concern that there remain considerable uncertainties about the _ 
 local _ lf . the lfs derived from large - area local redshifts survey ( e.g. , the stromlo / apm survey , loveday et al . 1992 ; the cfa survey , marzke , huchra , & geller 1994a ; the las campanas redshift survey , lin et al . 
 1996b ) all have similar shapes , but there are still substantial differences over the overall normalization , the characteristic luminosity , and the slope at low luminosities . the rapid evolution at @xmath17 required to match steep @xmath18-band counts at intermediate magnitudes @xmath19 ( maddox et al . 1990 ) could be reduced if the normalization or the faint - end slope have been underestimated . 
 the results of the largest of the local surveys , the las campanas redshift survey ( lcrs ) with 18678 galaxies used in the lf analysis and a median redshift of @xmath20 , are seemingly consistent with both a low normalization and a flat faint - end slope . 
 the lcrs is selected from ccd drift scans rather than photographic plates and surveys what should be a fair volume of the universe ( shectman et al . 
 1996 , davis 1996 ) . 
 it also probes both the southern and northern galactic caps . 
 accordingly , the local luminosity function computed from their data should be free from systematic photometric errors and fluctuations in large - scale structure in the distribution of galaxies . 
 however , both the cfa survey and the autofib survey find a normalization which is a factor of 2 higher than that obtained from the lcrs . 
 while the normalization of the cfa survey can be questioned on the grounds that it does not sample a fair volume , the autofib survey is the concatenation of many fields distributed across the sky . 
 the autofib survey is particularly important because the galaxy sample was selected with a much fainter surface brightness threshold than any of the other local surveys . 
 mcgaugh ( 1994 ) emphasizes that a large population of intrinsically luminous but low surface brightness galaxies may be missed in the shallow photometry on which all the local surveys , except autofib , are based . 
 a steep faint - end slope of the lf , with a power law exponent of @xmath21 , is a natural prediction of galaxy formation theories based on hierarchical structure formation models ( kauffmann , guiderdoni , & white 1994 ) . 
 there is only weak evidence for a steep faint - end slope in the local field galaxy lf . 
 marzke et al . 
 ( 1994b ) report an upturn in the luminosity function of late - type galaxies with @xmath22 , but lcrs , autofib , and cowie et al . 
 ( 1996 ) all derive a flat faint - end slope . 
 there is , however , evidence for a steep faint - end slope in galaxy clusters ( e.g. , de propris et al . 
 1995 , bernstein et al . 
 environmental influences on galaxy evolution may be reflected in variations of the lf for galaxies in different environments , and it is therefore important to measure the lf in a variety of environments .    in this paper , we investigate the evolution and environmental dependence of the galaxy lf based on data obtained during the course of our redshift survey of the corona borealis supercluster . the primary motivation for the survey was to study the dynamics of the supercluster . 
 however , the majority of galaxies for which we measured redshifts actually lie behind the corona borealis supercluster , thus providing a sample suitable for study of the evolution of the lf . 
 the galaxies were originally selected from plates taken as part of the second palomar observatory sky survey ( poss - ii ; @xcite ) and have been calibrated in the gunn @xmath23 and @xmath7 bands , which correspond roughly to the photographic @xmath24 and @xmath25 bands . 
 previous redshift surveys have generally been either selected in bluer bands ( @xmath18 ) , for sensitivity to changes in star - formation rates , or redder bands ( @xmath26 and @xmath27 ) , for sensitivity to old stellar populations which more reliably trace stellar mass . 
 although we had no option but to use the @xmath23 and @xmath7 bands , the two bands turn out fortuitously to have the virtue that corrections to the rest @xmath18 band , where lfs are traditionally computed and compared , are small since the @xmath23 band matches the rest @xmath18 band at @xmath28 and the @xmath7 band matches the rest @xmath18 band at @xmath29 . 
 the cnoc survey used photometry in @xmath23 and @xmath7 as well , and so it is particularly interesting to compare our results to that survey since there should be no systematic effects due to using different passbands for galaxy selection . 
 finally , with over 400 redshifts in the corona borealis supercluster , and roughly 300 in a background supercluster , we can explore the variation of the lf from the field to the supercluster environment . 
 the paper , the second in the series presenting results from the norris survey of the corona borealis supercluster , is organized as follows . in  2 , we summarize our survey , particularly emphasizing those features that are directly relevant to the computation of the lf . 
 we discuss the details of the computation of the lf in  3 . 
 the results are given in  4 for both field galaxies and for the two superclusters individually and are discussed in  5 . finally , we summarize our conclusions in  6 . 
 we use a hubble constant @xmath30 km s@xmath31 mpc@xmath32 and a deceleration parameter @xmath33 . for comparison to the most recent work in the field ( e.g. , cfrs and cnoc ) , 
 we use the ab - normalized @xmath18 band , @xmath6 ( oke 1974 ) . the offsets from @xmath6 to @xmath8 and @xmath18 are @xmath34 and @xmath35 ( fukugita , shimasaku , & ichikawa 1995 ) . 
 the norris survey of the corona borealis supercluster has been described in detail in small et al . 
 ( 1996 ) , paper i of the current series , and will be only briefly reviewed here . 
 the core of the supercluster covers a @xmath36 region of the sky centered at right ascension @xmath37 , declination @xmath38 and consists of 7 rich abell clusters at @xmath11 . 
 since the field - of - view of the 176-fiber norris spectrograph is only 400 arcmin@xmath39 , we planned to observe 36 fields arranged in a rectangular grid with a grid spacing of 1 . as it turned out , 
 we successfully observed 23 of the fields and 9 additional fields along the ridge of galaxies between abell 2061 and abell 2067 , yielding redshifts for 1491 extragalactic objects . 
 we have extended our survey with 163 redshifts from the literature , resulting in 1654 redshifts in the entire survey . 
 1022 of these galaxies lie beyond the corona borealis supercluster , although of these 1022 , 325 ( 318 with @xmath4 ) galaxies are in a background supercluster ( @xmath13 ) which we have dubbed the `` abell 2069 supercluster . '' 
 the survey fields are distributed across an area of 25 deg@xmath39 . the total area covered by the 32 observed fields , 
 albeit sparsely sampled , is 2.99 deg@xmath39 . 
 as noted above and described in detail in paper i , the objects have been selected from poss - ii photographic plates of poss - ii field 449 , which neatly covers the entire core of the supercluster . 
 we have both a @xmath24 ( kodak iii - aj emulsion with a gg395 filter ) plate and an @xmath25 ( kodak iii - af emulsion with a rg610 filter ) plate . 
 the plates were digitized with 1 arcsec@xmath39 pixels at the space telescope science institute and then processed using the sky image cataloging and analysis tool ( skicat , @xcite ) . 
 the instrumental intensities recorded by skicat were calibrated with ccd sequences in the @xmath23 and @xmath7 bands of galaxies in abell 2069 . 
 the random magnitude errors are 0.25@xmath40 for @xmath23 and @xmath7 brighter than 21@xmath40 and become substantially worse at fainter magnitudes . 
 ( we describe how we correct our computed lfs for these magnitude errors in  3.2 . ) with the skicat system , the star - galaxy separation is 90% accurate to @xmath41 . 
 our lf analysis is limited to galaxies with @xmath42 . 
 since our original motivation for the survey was to study the dynamics of the corona borealis supercluster , we chose a comparatively high spectral resolution for a faint galaxy redshift survey . 
 a third of the objects were observed with @xmath43spectral resolution during the period when the largest ccd available at palomar was a 1024@xmath39 device with 24  pixels ; the rest were observed with @xmath44  resolution with a very efficient 2048@xmath39 ccd ( also with 24   pixels ) . 
 since the operation of retrieving the fibers for one set - up and redeploying the fibers for another takes roughly an hour with the norris spectrograph , we decided to observe only two fields per night in order to minimize the amount of time lost due to changing fields . 
 thus , our exposures were 2 - 4 hours long , and we generally obtained high quality spectra on @xmath45 galaxies .    in figure 
 [ figures : success ] , we plot our success rate , the fraction of objects ( i.e. , including stars and quasars ) on which fibers were deployed for which we successfully measured redshifts , as a function of magnitude . figure [ figures : success ] shows that our success rate falls substantially below unity beyond @xmath46 . 
 therefore , we have computed weights for each galaxy to correct for a our incomplete sampling . 
 the weight for a particular object is defined to be simply the ratio of the total number of objects in the photometric catalog to the number of objects with redshifts in an interval of @xmath47 centered on the magnitude of the object . 
 this prescription assumes that the redshift distribution of the objects for which we failed to measure redshifts is identical to the redshift distribution of the objects for which we successfully measured redshifts . 
 the color distribution of the objects that we observed but failed to identify is similar to that of the objects that we successfully observed , leading us to conclude that we do not suffer biases against particular types of galaxies ( paper i ) . 
 moreover , we do not believe that we should have redshift - dependent biases in our success rate . 
 since we limit the computation of the lf to @xmath48 , we are unlikely to be affected by a bias in redshift . 
 the 4000  break and ca h , ca k lines of old stellar populations and the [ ] line of star - forming galaxies are all within our spectral range out to @xmath1 . 
 we plot the calculated weights as a function of @xmath7 magnitude for all galaxies with @xmath42 and which satisfy our surface brightness threshold ( see below ) in figure [ figures : weights ] . 
 the weights are greater than unity even for bright galaxies because of the sparse sampling of our survey area . 
 ( since the very brightest galaxies ( @xmath49 ) produce scattered light contamination of nearby spectra on the ccd , we usually did not place fibers on galaxies with @xmath49 , and thus the weights increase for the very brightest galaxies . )    in paper i , we carefully studied the surface brightness selection effects present in our sample . 
 we found that by restricting our sample to objects with @xmath42 and with core magnitudes @xmath50 ( where the core magnitude is the integrated magnitude within the central 9 arcsec@xmath39 ) , we are free from surface brightness selection effects . for comparison , @xmath51 corresponds to a central surface brightness of @xmath52 @xmath7 mag arcsec@xmath53 for a galaxy with an @xmath54 ( @xmath55 mag in the @xmath7 band ) disk . 
 we compute galaxy lfs in the rest - frame @xmath6 band and , for the local lf , in the rest - frame gunn @xmath7 band as well . 
 rest - frame colors and @xmath56-corrections are computed from the spectral energy distributions compiled by coleman , wu , & weedman ( 1980 , hereafter ccw ) . 
 we assign each galaxy a spectral type based on its @xmath57 color and its redshift . 
 following lilly et al . 
 ( 1995 ) , the spectral type is a real number which takes the values 0 for an elliptical galaxy , 2 for an sbc galaxy , 3 for an scd galaxy , and 4 for an i m galaxy . 
 we then interpolate between the ccw spectral energy distributions to construct the spectral energy distribution appropriate for the given spectral type . 
 galaxies whose colors are redder than a ccw e galaxy or bluer than a ccw i m galaxy are simply assigned the spectral energy distribution of an e galaxy or an i m galaxy , respectively . the number of galaxies with colors outside the limits defined by the ccw e and i m types is known to be small even to large redshifts ( e.g. , crampton et al . 
 the fact that many of our galaxies lie outside the ccw limits ( see figure 17 , paper i ) is due to the large errors in our colors ( @xmath58 ) . 
 we compute the absolute rest - frame @xmath6-band magnitude as follows : @xmath59 where @xmath60 incorporates the corrections based on the spectral energy distribution and @xmath61 is the luminosity distance in mpc . 
 the @xmath62 term represents the change in the bandwidth with redshift and is included in the traditional @xmath56-correction . again following lilly et al . 
 ( 1995 ) , we separate the bandwidth stretching term , which has negligible error since it depends only on the accurately measured redshift , from the terms which depend on the spectral energy distribution and are therefore much more uncertain . 
 we plot @xmath60 for the @xmath23 and @xmath7 bands in figure [ figures : keff ] . by converting from @xmath63 for objects with @xmath64 and from @xmath65 for objects with @xmath66 
 , @xmath60 may be kept less than @xmath67 for @xmath68 for all spectral types . 
 we use the step - wise maximum - likelihood ( swml ) method of efstathiou , ellis , & peterson ( 1988 ) to estimate the lf . 
 the probability of observing a galaxy of absolute magnitude @xmath69 at redshift @xmath70 in a flux - limited catalog is given by , @xmath71 where @xmath72 is the lf and @xmath73 is the intrinsically faintest galaxy observable at @xmath70 in the flux - limited catalog . 
 the lf is parameterized as a set of @xmath74 numbers @xmath75 such that @xmath76 and then the likelihood , @xmath77 where @xmath78 is the number of galaxies in the sample , is maximized with respect to the @xmath75 . 
 we constrain the values of @xmath75 to satisfy @xmath79 the virtues of the swml method are that it is not biased by the presence of clustering since the normalization of the lf cancels out of the expression for the probability @xmath80 and also that one does not have to assume a particular functional form for the lf . in order to include the weights , we make the substitution @xmath81 where @xmath82 is the weight of galaxy @xmath83 ( zucca , pozzetti , & zamorani 1994 , lin et al . 
 one must then estimate the mean galaxy density separately . 
 we use a standard technique which we describe below . 
 since the weights are greater than one , their use will increase the calculated likelihood for the sample and thus lead to artificially small error estimates . by renormalizing the weights so that @xmath84 , the error estimates are appropriate for the true sample size ( lin et al . 1996b ) . 
 note that the normalization constraint on the @xmath75 reduces the estimated errors . 
 we do not use the traditional @xmath85 method ( @xcite ) employed by ellis et al . 
 ( 1996 ) and lilly et al . 
 ( 1995 ) since the method is sensitive to clustering . 
 we have , however , compared the results of the two techniques for samples with @xmath86 , where the clustering in our survey is not pronounced , and found that they agree satisfactorily . for @xmath87 
 , we can construct volume - limited sub - samples with @xmath4 in which any galaxy with @xmath88 is visible in the entire volume . 
 of course , the value of the lf in a given magnitude bin for a volume - limited sample is estimated by counting the number galaxies with absolute magnitudes in the bin and then dividing by the volume of the sample and the width of the bin . 
 the swml lfs for @xmath87 agree well with the lfs estimated from the volume - limited samples . 
 we compute the mean density @xmath89 of a magnitude - limited sub - sample using the following estimator : @xmath90 where @xmath91 is the volume of the sample , @xmath78 is the number of objects in the sample , and @xmath92 is the selection function . 
 the selection function , @xmath93 gives the fraction of the lf observable at a given redshift . 
 here , @xmath94 is the lf , @xmath95 is the maximum absolute magnitude that an object can have at redshift @xmath96 and still be included in the sample , and @xmath97 is the absolute magnitude of the most instrinsically faint galaxy in the sample . in practice , one does not begin evaluating the integrals at @xmath98 , but rather at the absolute magnitude of the most instrinsically bright galaxy in the sample . the estimator in equation [ equations : mean_density ] 
 is almost identical to the minimum variance estimator derived by davis & huchra ( 1982 ) for @xmath99 and is unbiased by density inhomogeneities . 
 an additional complication of computing a lf in the @xmath6 band where the objects have been selected in the @xmath7 band is that one must ensure that any object , regardless of its color , would have been detectable in both bands . 
 if one ignores this complication , then the faintest objects at a given redshift will be biased in color . in our survey , since the @xmath7 band is centered at a longer wavelength than the @xmath18 band , the faintest objects would be biased to the red . in order to avoid such a bias , 
 we adjust our absolute @xmath6 magnitude limits as a function of redshift so that the bluest galaxy at any @xmath6 magnitude limit would be observable in the @xmath7 band . 
 for the local lf computed in the @xmath7 band , the bias works in the opposite sense , and so we adjust our rest - frame absolute @xmath7 magnitude limits to ensure that the reddest galaxy a given limit would be detected in the observed @xmath7 band .    for each lf , we estimate the parameters of the best - fitting schechter ( 1976 ) function , @xmath100 where @xmath101 is the normalization , @xmath102 determines the location of the bright - end exponential cutoff , and @xmath103 is the faint - end slope . 
 the fitting was performed using a standard @xmath104-minimization algorithm ( press et al . 
 1992 ) with the schechter function integrated over the width of the adopted magnitude bin . 
 we intend these fits to be useful for comparisons with other work . usually , there are too few points for the fits to be well defined 
 .    our random magnitude errors ( @xmath105 ) will artificially brighten the characteristic magnitude @xmath102 of the lf and steepen the faint end . 
 we correct for the magnitude errors by fitting to the data points a schechter function ( equation [ equations : schechter ] ) convolved with a gaussian of dispersion @xmath106 ( efstathiou et al . 
 in fact , however , the corrections to the schechter function parameters are substantially less than the 1@xmath107 statistical errors . 
 the error in the normalization from the @xmath104-fitting only includes the uncertainties due to @xmath102 and @xmath103 . 
 the error due to large - scale structure fluctuations is @xmath108 ( davis & huchra 1982 ) , where @xmath109 is the second moment of the two - point spatial correlation function ( peebles 1980 ) and @xmath91 is the appropriate volume . 
 we use @xmath110 ( @xmath111 mpc)@xmath112 ( tucker et al . 1997 ) and record the error from density fluctuations alongside the uncertainty in @xmath101 due to @xmath102 and @xmath103 . 
 in the following subsections , we report our results for the local lf , the evolution of the lf , and the lfs of the corona borealis and abell 2069 superclusters . 
 all samples are magnitude - limited at @xmath113 . 
 the parameters of the best fitting schechter functions are summarized in table 1 , where the sample is given in the first column , the number of galaxies used to compute the lf in the second column , the absolute range over which the fit is valid in the third column , @xmath101 in the fourth column , @xmath102 in the fifth column , @xmath103 in the sixth column , the reduced @xmath104 in the seventh column , and the estimate of the variance due to density fluctuations in the eighth column . 
 the numbers of galaxies listed in the second column are slightly smaller than the total number of galaxies satisfying the sample listed in the first column because a few galaxies have been trimmed from each sample , as described above , to ensure that there are no color biases in the faintest bins 
 . corrections to @xmath101 to match galaxy counts , as discussed below , have _ not _ been applied to the values listed in table 1 . 
 we wish to emphasize that the fitted schechter functions are intended only to guide the eye and that comparisons of the various lfs in this paper are best done by comparing the individual data points in the plots . 
 the @xmath6-band local galaxy lf is plotted in figure [ figures : local_lf ] . 
 the unfilled circles show the lf for @xmath114 with the superclusters removed . 
 the filled circles show the lf for @xmath114 with the the superclusters included . in order to remove the superclusters 
 , we simply delete all objects with @xmath115 . 
 the median redshift of our local sample with the superclusters removed is @xmath116 . 
 the stromlo / apm lf is plotted with the solid line . 
 we also plot the autofid local lf with the dashed line . in figure 
 [ figures : local_lf ] and all subsequent figures where appropriate , we convolve the schechter function fits to the lfs from other surveys with a gaussian of dispersion @xmath106 in order to facilitate comparisons with our lf data points , which are constructed with galaxies whose photometry suffers from random magnitude errors of @xmath106 . 
 all of the local luminosity functions have similar shapes , but the normalizations and low luminosity ends vary significantly .    in order to investigate 
 further the normalization of the local luminosity function , we compute the _ shape _ of local luminosity in the rest - frame @xmath7 band and then normalize this lf to the @xmath7-band counts of weir , djorgovski , & fayyad ( 1995 ) . 
 we plot our @xmath7-band local lf , normalized to the counts of weir et al . 
 ( 1995 ) , in figure [ figures : local_lf_r ] , along with the @xmath7-band local lf from lcrs . to convert from isophotal @xmath117 magnitudes to total gunn @xmath7 magnitudes , 
 we apply a 25% isophotal - to - total light correction and then use @xmath118 ( shectman et al . 
 thus , the corrections compensate for each other and @xmath119 . the counts of weir et al . 
 ( 1995 ) are based on 4 overlapping , high galactic latitude plates taken as part of the poss - ii survey . knowing the shape of the lf 
 , we can estimate the differential number counts as @xmath120 { dv \over dz } dz \nonumber \\                & = & \phi^\ast \int_0^\infty \phi^\prime[m(m , z ) ] { dv \over dz } dz \\            & = & \phi^\ast { di \over dm } \nonumber , \label{equations : diff_counts}\end{aligned}\ ] ] where @xmath121 is @xmath72 with @xmath101 set equal to 1 , @xmath122 is the absolute magnitude of an object at redshift @xmath96 with apparent magnitude @xmath123 , and the @xmath124 are the magnitude intervals . 
 we estimate @xmath101 by minimizing the quantity @xmath125 ^ 2 } \over { \phi^\ast di(m_i)}}\ ] ] with respect to @xmath101 ( efstathiou et al . 
 1988 ) , which yields @xmath126 ^ 2 / di(m_i ) } \over { \sum_i di(m_i)}}.\ ] ] we find @xmath127 mpc@xmath32 where the errors reflect the changes due to varying jointly @xmath102 and @xmath103 by @xmath128 . 
 this is a 21% reduction from the normalization determined in the norris field itself . 
 although the median redshift of our local sample is @xmath116 , the agreement with lcrs ( @xmath129 ) in the @xmath7 band leads us to believe that we have computed a fair estimate of the local lf .    in figure 
 [ figures : r_counts ] , we plot the @xmath7-band differential number counts . 
 the histogram shows the counts from the poss - ii plate from which we selected our objects . 
 the thick solid line is the counts from weir et al . 
 ( 1995 ) , and the triangles are ccd counts from metcalfe et al . 
 the dashed line represents the predicted counts based on our field galaxy lf , including evolution at @xmath86 ( see  4.2 below ) , with the superclusters removed . 
 even with the superclusters removed , our local lf appears to be normalized too high . the solid line , however , gives the predicted counts with the normalization reduced by 21% . with the reduced normalization , 
 the predicted counts agree quite well with the observed counts to @xmath113 . for comparison , 
 we also show , as the dotted line , the predicted counts from the lcrs . 
 these counts fall below the weir et al . 
 ( 1995 ) counts for @xmath130 because they do not include the evolution of the lf beyond @xmath131 . 
 since the volume of the norris region , with the superclusters removed , is @xmath132 mpc@xmath112 , we would expect from equation [ equations : delta_n ] @xmath133 . 
 it is therefore not cause for concern that this region is overdense by 21% . 
 we compute the field galaxy lf in two redshift intervals : @xmath134 and @xmath135 . 
 the results are plotted in figure [ figures : field_lf ] . 
 the normalization of the local lf ( unfilled circles ) has been reduced by 21% to match the @xmath7-band counts . 
 the filled circles are the lf of the high redshift interval . 
 we also plot the lfs of the stromlo / apm survey ( solid line ) , the cnoc survey ( @xmath136 , dashed line ) , and the cfrs survey ( @xmath135 , dotted line ) , all of which have been convolved with a gaussian with @xmath137 to account for random photometry errors . since the lf for the autofib survey was divided into redshift intervals which do not neatly match our redshift intervals and , more importantly , since lin et al . 
 ( 1996a ) have already performed a detailed comparison with the autofib survey , we do not plot the autofib lfs . 
 the @xmath135 lf has clearly evolved with respect to the local lf . 
 we create two sub - samples of galaxies according to the rest - frame equivalent width of [ ] @xmath93727 . 
 the division is made at a rest - frame equivalent width of 10 , which roughly corresponds to dividing the sample into types earlier and later than sbc ( kennicutt 1992 ) and thus allows direct comparison with the results of cnoc and cfrs . 
 for galaxies with @xmath139 , [ ] is not redshifted into our observed wavelength range , and so we use the strength of h@xmath140 to divide our sample . after correcting for stellar absorption , we have 7 galaxies with @xmath139 and @xmath138(h@xmath140 ) @xmath141 5 , which we include in the @xmath138 ( [ ] ) @xmath141 10  sample . 
 we have also investigated separating our sample by color , but we have found that the large errors on our colors tend to dilute trends which are seen clearly in samples defined by @xmath138 ( [ ] ) . 
 the lfs for galaxies with @xmath138 ( [ ] ) @xmath142 10  and @xmath138 ( [ ] ) @xmath141 10  are shown in figure [ figures : no_o2_lf ] and figure [ figures : o2_lf ] , respectively . 
 we also plot in each figure the lfs for the corresponding color - selected samples from cnoc and cfrs . 
 it is important to remember when considering possible detailed discrepancies between our lfs and the cnoc and cfrs lfs that our sample is divided by @xmath138 ( [ ] ) , which , while roughly equivalent to color selection , is not identical . 
 there is no significant indication that the population of early - type galaxies ( i.e. , @xmath138 ( [ ] ) @xmath142 10 ) has evolved since @xmath1 ; this result is not surprising given that the light of early - type galaxies is dominated by red , long - lived stellar populations . 
 in contrast , the lfs of the late - type galaxies ( i.e. , those with @xmath138 ( [ ] ) @xmath141 10 ) show striking evidence for evolution , even though the sample sizes are small and the error bars are large . 
 the lfs of the corona borealis supercluster and the abell 2069 supercluster are given in figure [ figures : clusters_lf ] . 
 we take the redshift range of the corona borealis supercluster to be @xmath143 and that of the abell 2069 supercluster to be @xmath144 . 
 the normalization of the corona borealis supercluster function is a factor of 2 greater than that of the abell 2069 supercluster , but the shapes of the lfs of the two superclusters are similar . 
 note that the volumes used to normalize the superclusters lfs are in redshift space ; the real - space volumes may be quite different ( see  5.3 below for a detailed discussion ) . 
 since the bright ends of the supercluster lfs are clearly not well - described by a schechter function , we restrict our fit to @xmath145 . 
 in addition , the fit to the corona borealis supercluster is limited to @xmath146 since the faintest two data points appear to describe a sharp upturn in the lf . 
 prior evidence for rapid evolution of the galaxy lf to @xmath17 from galaxy counts was based crucially on normalizing the local lf to the bright ( @xmath147 ) galaxy counts from schmidt - telescope photographic surveys ( e.g. , maddox et al . 
 . with this low normalization , predicted counts from the no - evolution model fall well short of the observed counts for @xmath148 . 
 however , the evolution of the lf which we and others observe is not enough to make up for this shortfall . in figure 
 [ figures : b_counts ] , we plot the observed counts from the apm survey ( maddox et al . 1990 ) and from the ccd survey of metcalfe et al . 
 ( 1991 ) , along with various predicted counts . 
 the dotted line shows the expected counts using the loveday et al . 
 ( 1992 ) lf for @xmath134 and the cnoc @xmath6 lf for @xmath86 . 
 despite including the observed evolution of the lf , the predicted counts only begin to agree with the observed counts for @xmath149 , by which point the predicted counts are dominated by galaxies with @xmath86 . in contrast , the predicted counts computed using the evolving lfs measured for our survey and for the autofib survey , while substantially overpredicting the counts for @xmath150 , match the observed counts for @xmath151 .    in order to help unravel this confusing situation , we plot in figure [ figures : b_and_r_lf ] various @xmath6- and @xmath7-band local lfs on the same diagram . 
 @xmath6-band lfs are plotted with respect to the bottom axis , while @xmath7-band lfs are plotted with respect to the top axis . 
 the two axes are offset by @xmath152 , which is the median color we measure for field galaxies with @xmath87 . 
 our @xmath6- and @xmath7-band local lfs , both of which have been reduced by 21% following the discussion in  4.1 , are plotted with filled and unfilled circles , respectively . with the color offset , they agree extremely well . 
 the stromlo / apm lf , represented by the solid line , lies consistently below our @xmath6-band lf . 
 the lcrs @xmath7-band lf is consistent with our @xmath7-band lf . unlike lin et al . 
 ( 1996b ) , we do _ not _ conclude that the lcrs @xmath7-band lf matches the stromlo / apm lf . 
 the reason for the disagreement lies in the different measurements of the median color of local galaxies . 
 our median color is that of an sb galaxy , whereas the lcrs median color is that of a much redder e galaxy . the median color of galaxies in the _ third reference catalogue of bright galaxies _ ( de vaucouleurs et al . 
 1991 ) is @xmath153 ( see table 2 of fukugita et al . 
 1995 ) , which is roughly that of an sb galaxy . 
 sebok ( 1986 ) also concludes that the typical local galaxy has the color of an sb galaxy . 
 it is thus surprising that the mean color of the lcrs galaxies is so red . 
 since our @xmath7-band lf agrees with the lcrs @xmath7-band lf and since the lcrs computed the colors of their galaxies by matching directly to the apm catalog , the most natural explanation for the anomalous red colors of the lcrs is a systematic error in the bright apm magnitudes . 
 we note that weir et al . 
 ( 1995 ) conclude that magnitudes derived from @xmath24 plates are only reliable for @xmath154 or , equivalently , @xmath155 . 
 galaxies brighter than @xmath156 are saturated on the photographic plates . a systematic error in the bright apm counts 
 would remove the need for rapid , and otherwise unsubstantiated , galaxy evolution at @xmath17 . 
 we note also that there is possible evidence for a rise in the local lf above an @xmath157 for the least luminous galaxies in our survey . 
 such a rise is evident in the data of marzke et al . 
 ( 1994b ) for irregular galaxies , the cfrs , and the low surface brightness galaxy redshift survey of sprayberry et al . 
 similar behavior is also perhaps visible in the local lf of the autofib survey . 
 although ellis et al . 
 ( 1996 ) argue against a rise in the lf for @xmath158 , the three faintest points in the their local lf ( their figure 8) all lie above their preferred schechter function fit . 
 however , since such faint galaxies are only visible in our survey in a quite small volume , we refrain from attempting to make a definitive statement . 
 we asserted in  4.2 that the lf of star - forming galaxies ( @xmath138 ( [ ] ) @xmath141 10 ) evolved from @xmath0 to @xmath1 and that the luminosity function of galaxies with weak [ ] emission ( @xmath142 10 ) did not . 
 a powerful method to verify this result is to compute @xmath159 for appropriate samples ( @xcite ) . if there is no evolution in the number density of objects , @xmath160 ; if the number density declines , @xmath161 ; and if the number density increases , @xmath162 . 
 our @xmath159 analysis is complicated by the need to remove the superclusters and to account for the 21% overdensity of our local field . in order to excise the superclusters , 
 we simply remove all galaxies with @xmath115 . if the maximum redshift @xmath163 at which a galaxy could be observed in our survey lies in the range 0.06 to 0.13 , we set @xmath164 . 
 we correct for the overdensity of our local field by reducing the weights of galaxies with @xmath114 by 21% . 
 the values of @xmath159 for various samples of galaxies are given table 2 , both with and without the 21% correction to the weights of the galaxies with @xmath114 . 
 for samples selected by color , we compute the @xmath159 statistic for galaxies in the redshift range @xmath2 ( with the supercluster region excluded ) . for samples selected by the strength of [ ] 
 , we use the redshift range @xmath165 ( with the supercluster region excluded ) since [ ] from objects with @xmath139 is not redshifted into our observed wavelength range . 
 the differences between our weighted and unweighted statistics are small . 
 the @xmath159 test supports our claim , at the @xmath166 level for the weighted statistic , that the population of star - forming galaxies is evolving . 
 the rate of evolution increases with the strength of [ ] . 
 the population of galaxies with @xmath138 ( [ ] ) @xmath141 20  has @xmath167 . 
 this result is analogous to the results from cfrs in which the rate of evolution is the strongest for the bluest population of galaxies . 
 @xmath159 for the population of red galaxies is consistent with no evolution , in agreement with the lf analysis . broadly speaking , our results are in accord with the results of cfrs , autofib , cowie et al ( 1996 ) , and cnoc . 
 since the cnoc survey , like our survey , uses photometry in the @xmath23 and @xmath7 bands , it is particularly interesting to compare our results in detail to theirs since many of the systematic effects associated with @xmath56- and color - corrections ought to be the same . 
 it is encouraging to see ( figure [ figures : no_o2_lf ] and [ figures : o2_lf ] ) that , given the small samples , our lfs agree well with those of cnoc . 
 the agreement is significantly improved if one reduces the normalization of the cnoc lfs by 20% , as , in fact , is recommended by lin et al . 
 ( 1996a ) . 
 now that we have confirmed that the population of blue galaxies is evolving with redshift , we wish to investigate whether we can detect differences in the colors and the spectral properties of the evolving population with redshift . 
 first , we reiterate that the color distribution of objects with measured redshifts is similar to the color distribution of unidentified objects , leading us to believe that the type distribution of the identified objects is not strongly biased ( paper i ) . although emission lines are generally easier to detect than absorption lines , the difficulty of identifying emission lines at observed wavelengths longer than 5577 , where there are many strong night sky features , combined with the strength of ca h , ca k , and the 4000  break in absorption line objects at @xmath168 mitigate the bias in favor of emission line objects . a sample of the spectra of 8 absorption line objects in this redshift range is shown in figure [ figures : ab_line_objs ] to illustrate the ease of detection of their characteristic absorption features .    in figure [ figures : obs_g - r ] , we plot the observed @xmath5 color as a function of redshift of all the objects in our survey along with the tracks of five representative model galaxy spectra . 
 the bluest spectrum is simply a flat - spectrum object , @xmath169 the four other spectra are typical of the hubble types e , sbc , scd , and i m and are taken from ccw . 
 the large , solid diamonds mark the observed median color in the redshift ranges @xmath170 ( arranged to exclude the superclusters ) , @xmath171 , @xmath172 , @xmath173 , and @xmath174 . 
 perhaps counter - intuitively , we see that the observed median color does not become progressively bluer with respect to the model spectra with increasing redshift . 
 as discussed by lilly et al . 
 ( 1995 ) and illustrated in our figure [ figures : rest - frame_g - r ] , the median color does not become bluer because the color - magnitude relation in the local universe ( i.e. , the fact that more luminous galaxies are redder ) breaks down for @xmath131 as the population of blue galaxies brightens while the population of red galaxies does not evolve significantly . 
 we plot in figure [ figures : rest - frame_g - r ] the absolute @xmath6-band magnitudes versus rest - frame @xmath5 for our galaxies divided into four intervals in redshift . in the low - redshift interval , the color - magnitude relation is apparent , but it disappears in the higher redshift intervals . at @xmath175 
 , we observe far down the lf to absolute magnitudes where blue galaxies are dominant . at @xmath131 
 , we do not observe as far down the lf , but the population of blue galaxies has brightened so as to be included in the samples .    the increase in the luminosity of the population of blue galaxies 
 is presumably associated with a change in the star formation activity at earlier times . in our spectra , there are two convenient star formation indicators , [ ] @xmath93727 and h@xmath10 @xmath94101 . 
 [ ] emission is found in galaxies with ongoing star formation , and its strength is proportional to the strength of h@xmath103 ( @xcite ) . 
 strong h@xmath10 absorption is a signature of the presence of a population of a - stars , which are visible @xmath1761 gyr after a burst of star formation . 
 these lines are reliably measured by automated programs ( see paper i ) since both occur in regions of the spectrum where the continuum is featureless and there is little crowding from other lines . 
 an important virtue of the h@xmath10 line is that , since it appears in absorption , a galaxy with detectable h@xmath10 would have been identified no matter what its spectral characteristics , which implies that there is no bias towards detecting objects with h@xmath10 absorption . a galaxy with [ ] emission is , of course , easier to identify than if it had had only absorption lines . 
 however , as we discussed above , the combination of the difficulty of identifying weak emission lines in the face of strong sky subtraction residuals and of the ease of identifying the strong features characteristic of absorption - line galaxies at moderate redshifts suggests that our survey is not strongly biased towards detecting objects with [ ] . by adding together spectra of late - type galaxies in two redshift intervals in order to obtain two spectra with very high signal - to - noise ratios , heyl et al . 
 ( 1996 ) find that the two star - formation indicators [ ] @xmath93727 and h@xmath10 have both become stronger in the higher redshift mean spectrum . 
 those authors interpreted the increase in the strength of [ ] and h@xmath10 in the @xmath86 spectra to imply that not only were the higher - redshift galaxies forming stars more rapidly , but that also the nature of the star formation was changing with redshift . 
 specifically , they asserted that the strong h@xmath10 absorption in the higher redshift sample is evidence that the star formation in that sample is dominated by bursts . with our high - quality spectra , 
 we can reliably measure [ ] and h@xmath10 without adding together the spectra of many galaxies . in figure 
 [ figures : o2_and_hd ] , we plot as a function of redshift the fraction of galaxies with [ ] emission and the fraction of galaxies with h@xmath10 absorption . 
 the vertical dashed line marks the redshift beyond which h@xmath10 is shifted into the region of the spectrum in which sky subtraction becomes increasingly difficult . while the fraction of galaxies with [ ] emission increases with redshift , the fraction of galaxies with strong h@xmath10 absorption shows no significant variation with redshift , suggesting that the star formation is _ not _ occurring in short - lived bursts ( c.f . 
 , hammer et al . 
 1997 )    in order to investigate this disagreement more carefully , we repeat the analysis of heyl et al . ( 1996 ) and construct high signal - to - noise ratio composite spectra . 
 the individual spectra have been median - combined after scaling by the median count level . 
 the magnitude weights , which correct for our incompleteness at faint magnitudes , have not been applied since scaling by the median count level in each spectrum effectively incorporates the magnitude weights . in figure 
 [ figures : coadd ] , we plot the composite spectra of galaxies with @xmath138 ( [ ] ) @xmath141 20 , @xmath177 , and either @xmath178 ( thick line , @xmath179 ) or @xmath180 ( thin line , @xmath181 ) 
 . @xmath138 ( [ ] ) @xmath141 20   is typical for the late - type galaxies in which heyl et al . 
 ( 1996 ) observe spectral changes with redshift . 
 while the [ ] line is modestly stronger in the higher redshift composite spectrum , there is no difference in the strength of h@xmath10 ( which is partially filled - in by emission in both spectra ) , which indicates that the nature of the star formation has not changed from @xmath1 to @xmath182 in contrast to heyl et al . 
 ( 1996 ) , we again do not conclude that the spectra of intermediate - redshift blue galaxies show spectral signs of short bursts of star formation . 
 ( we do not believe that the small differences in the rest - equivalent widths of the ca h and k lines are significant since it is difficult to fit a reliable continuum in the vicinity of the 4000  break . ) 
 the modest increase in the strength of the [ ] line with redshift for galaxies with @xmath183 is due , as previously discussed by cowie et al . 
 ( 1996 ) , to the increase in the intrinsic luminosity of star - forming galaxies with redshift . in figure [ figures : o2_ew ] 
 , we plot absolute magnitude versus the rest equivalent width of [ ] for the galaxies in our sample divided into four redshift intervals . as the redshift increases , 
 more and more luminous galaxies exhibit strong [ ] . 
 notice , however , that the range of rest equivalent widths does not vary significantly with redshift . 
 it is difficult to draw firm conclusions about the nature of the evolving galaxy population from the lfs alone . 
 the lfs provide only a statistical view of the entire population and include information about the evolution of individual galaxies only indirectly . 
 furthermore , the luminosity of a galaxy is an unreliable tracer of the physical state of the galaxy . 
 the luminosity of a galaxy , especially in the rest - frame ultraviolet , can change dramatically on short timescales , making the identification of the descendants of distant galaxies in the local population very difficult . in order to make further progress , additional data on the nature of distant galaxies 
 is required . 
 the morphologies of distant galaxies , measured with the _ hubble space telescope _ ( hst ) , are already providing crucial clues ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) . 
 the counts of faint elliptical and early - type spiral galaxies match predictions based on counts in the local universe , provided that the local lf is normalized , as advocated here , a factor of @xmath1761.5 - 2 higher than found by loveday et al . 
 in contrast , the hst number counts of late - type and irregular galaxies are far in excess of the counts expected from observations of nearby galaxies , even with a high normalization of the local lf .    an alternative method for selecting distant galaxies 
 is by their gas absorption cross section . 
 steidel , dickinson , & persson ( 1994 ) study the evolution of 58 galaxies selected by @xmath1842796 , 2803 absorption seen in the spectra of high - redshift quasars . 
 these authors found that the galaxies responsible for quasar absorption lines in the range @xmath185 , which typically have luminosities near @xmath54 , do not evolve over the redshift range . 
 however , their sample is small and , when divided by color , is not inconsistent with results from surveys of galaxies selected by apparent magnitude ( lilly et al . 
 in addition , steidel et al . 
 ( 1994 ) note that intrinsically faint blue galaxies do not appear in their sample , and so the population of galaxies which is observed to be evolving most rapidly is not included in their survey . 
 it is now possible , especially with 10m - class telescopes , to measure the masses ( e.g. , vogt et al . 1993 , 1996 ; rix et al . 
 1996 , guzmn et al . 1996 ) and chemical abundances of distant galaxies . since the masses and metallicities of galaxies evolve more smoothly than the luminosities , measurements of these two quantities will allow more easily interpretable comparisons of distant and local populations ( guzmn et al . 1996 ) . 
 in addition , the mass and metallicity are , compared to morphology and even gas absorption cross section ( churchill , steidel , & vogt 1996 ) , straightforward to define and interpret . a survey to measure the masses and chemical abundances of the faint blue galaxies ought to yield important insights into the nature of this rapidly evolution galaxy population and aid in the identification of their present - day counterparts . 
 the lfs of the two superclusters have quite similar shapes and generally resemble the field galaxy lf . since the normalizations of the superclusters lfs are computed in redshift space , in which distances along the line - of - sight may be substantially altered with respect to real space , it is not straighforward to compare the normalization of the supercluster lfs with that of the local field galaxy lf . for the purpose of the discussion here , 
 we introduce a factor @xmath186 , the ratio of the redshift - space volume to the real - space volume . 
 we expect @xmath186 to be in the range @xmath187 . 
 the lower limit corresponds to assuming that the peculiar velocities in the supercluster regions are small ; the upper limit corresponds to assuming that the depth of the superclusters along the line - of - sight is similar to the linear sizes of the superclusters on the plane of the sky ( @xmath188 mpc ) . 
 the real - space mean density of galaxies in the corona borealis supercluster , obtained simply by integrating the measured lf data points ( @xmath189 ) , is @xmath190 mpc@xmath32 . 
 the mean density of field galaxies in the same range of absolute magnitude is @xmath191 mpc@xmath32 . 
 similarly , the real - space mean density of galaxies in the a2069 supercluster ( @xmath192 ) is @xmath193 mpc@xmath32 , while the mean density of field galaxies in the same range of absolute magnitude is @xmath194 mpc@xmath32 . 
 thus , the overdensities are @xmath195 and @xmath196 for the corona borealis and a2069 superclusters , respectively . 
 it is also important to know whether our sampling of the superclusters is biased towards either the abell clusters within the superclusters or the `` field '' of the superclusters . 
 owing to the difficulties of converting redshift - space volumes to real - space volumes , we assess our sampling of the superclusters using projected surface densities , which are not affected by redshift - space distortions . for the corona borealis supercluster , 
 the project surface density @xmath197 is the mean redshift - space galaxy volume density multiplied by the depth in redshift space of the supercluster along the line - of - sight , @xmath198 mpc . 
 thus , @xmath199 mpc@xmath53 @xmath200 mpc@xmath53 . 
 we compare this value with the median surface density of the regions surrounding successfully observed corona borealis supercluster galaxies . 
 we compute the surface density around a given corona borealis supercluster galaxy by counting the number of supercluster galaxies in a 6 arcmin diameter circle surrounding the chosen galaxy . we either simply count the number of galaxies with measured redshifts within the corona borealis supercluster , or we count the total number of galaxies on the original poss - ii @xmath25 plate , weighted by the empirically - determined fraction of galaxies at a given magnitude which are in the supercluster . 
 the results of these two methods agree well : the median values of the raw and weighted surface densities are @xmath201 mpc@xmath53 and @xmath202 mpc@xmath53 . 
 these two values bracket the projected surface density measured by multiplying the mean galaxy density ( computed from the lf ) by the line - of - sight depth of the supercluster . 
 we conclude , therefore , that we have fairly sampled the corona borealis supercluster . 
 we perform an identical analysis for the background a2069 supercluster . 
 the redshift - space depth of the a2069 supercluster is also @xmath203 mpc . 
 given a mean galaxy volume density of @xmath204 mpc@xmath32 , the projected surface density is @xmath205 mpc@xmath53 . 
 the median surface density of the regions surrounding the successfully observed a2069 supercluster galaxies , computed in the same fashion as for the corona borealis supercluster , is @xmath206 mpc@xmath53 ( unweighted ) or @xmath207 mpc@xmath53 ( weighted ) . 
 thus , we are slightly biased to the denser regions of the a2069 supercluster . 
 the overall resemblance between the supercluster lfs and the field galaxy lf suggests that the fundamental physical processes which drive galaxy formation and evolution must not depend strongly on environment . 
 there are , however , important differences between the lfs in the field and in the superclusters that must ultimately be due to environmental effects . 
 the most striking difference between the field and supercluster lfs is that the supercluster lfs to do not continue the exponential decline for galaxies brighter than @xmath208 . 
 both superclusters evidently contain a population of very luminous galaxies . despite the fact that there are only 6 galaxies with @xmath209 in the two superclusters combined , 
 it is clear that these galaxies are giant ellipticals found in the densest regions of the superclusters . 
 the 4 of the 6 for which we have spectra ( the other 2 were taken from the literature ) are dominated by the light of an old , red stellar population . 
 all of the galaxies are found in regions in the upper 27th percentile of local surace density , with half of them found in regions in the upper 10th percentile . 
 in fact , the four galaxies in the corona borealis supercluster are all found in the dense ridge of galaxies between the abell clusters a2061 and a2067 . for the corona borealis supercluster , the characteristic magnitude @xmath102 is @xmath210 brighter than in the field and 
 is quite close to the value measured by colless ( 1989 ) for rich clusters . 
 there is no significant difference between @xmath102 for the abell 2069 supercluster and that of the field .    for the corona borealis supercluster lf 
 , the data points for the two faintest magnitude bins hint that the lf may steepen significantly for galaxies fainter than @xmath211 . 
 since the hint is based on only two data points , which are themselves based on only 29 galaxies , we must be cautious in our interpretation . 
 however , a steepening of the supercluster lf fainter than @xmath211 would be in accord with observations of the faint end of the lf in galaxy clusters and groups , in which a number of workers report steep ( @xmath212 ) lfs ( impey , bothun & malin 1988 ; ferguson & sandage 1991 ; biviano et al . 1995 ; de propris et al . 1995 ; driver & phillipps 1996 ) . with the exception of the study of the coma cluster by biviano et al . 
 ( 1995 ) , the observations of steep faint ends in cluster and group lfs have depended , since redshifts were not available , on the subtraction of a background component from the foreground cluster , a procedure which is prone to systematic errors . although it would be unwise to draw strong conclusions from our two data points , they do have the virtue of being based on galaxies with measured redshifts . 
 we have presented an analysis of the lf of galaxies in the norris survey of the corona borealis supercluster . 
 our @xmath7-band lf of local field galaxies , when normalized to counts in high galactic latitude fields , agrees well with the lcrs . 
 however , the normalization of our @xmath6 local lf is roughly a factor of 1.6 higher than that of the stromlo / apm survey . since lin et al . 
 ( 1996b ) claim that the lcrs local lf agrees well with the stromlo / apm survey , the difference must lie in a systematic photometry error in one ( or more ) of the three surveys . a clue to the nature of this error 
 is provided by examining the mean colors of norris and lcrs galaxies . 
 the mean color of local norris galaxies is that of an sb galaxy , whereas the mean color of lcrs galaxies , computed by matching lcrs galaxies directly with galaxies in the apm catalog , is that of an e galaxy . given the agreement of the norris and lcrs @xmath7-band lfs , we therefore believe that the error is most likely in the apm catalog . 
 indeed , brightening the magnitudes of apm galaxies with @xmath213 by @xmath1760.25@xmath40 would bring all of the local lfs into agreement . a ccd - based local redshift survey ( e.g. , the sloan survey 
 , gunn & weinberg 1995 ) will certainly resolve any remaining questions about the local lf . 
 we have observed evolution of the field galaxy lf within our sample , thereby confirming the conclusions drawn from several previous redshift surveys . 
 the evolution is limited to the population of blue , star - forming galaxies . 
 the population of blue galaxies becomes more luminous with increasing redshift , and thus the median color of the field galaxy population does not change . 
 the evolution of the population of blue galaxies is reflected in the larger fraction of galaxies at higher redshift exhibiting spectral signatures of ongoing star formation . 
 in contrast to the results of heyl et al . 
 ( 1996 ) , but in agreement with hammer et al . 
 ( 1996 ) , we find that the star formation is long - lived . 
 we do not see evidence for short - term bursts of star formation . 
 we are unable to detect any evolution of the population of galaxies with @xmath138 ( [ ] ) @xmath142 10 . the fact that the evolution which we observe in our @xmath23- and @xmath7-band selected survey is consistent with the results of the surveys of lilly et al . 
 ( 1995 ) , ellis et al . 
 ( 1996 ) , cowie et al . 
 ( 1996 ) , and lin et al . 
 ( 1996 ) adds to the already strong evidence that a consistent picture of the evolution of the galaxy lf is emerging . 
 in particular , it is quite reassuring that our lfs agree well with those of lin et al . 
 ( 1996a ) since both used the @xmath23 and @xmath7 bands and should therefore have very similar systematic effects . 
 the lfs of the two superclusters show significant differences from the field galaxy lf , despite considerable overall similarity . 
 since the superclusters are @xmath214 denser than the field , we are likely to be observing the influence of the environment on galaxy formation and evolution . 
 the most prominent difference is an excess of very bright galaxies ( @xmath208 ) relative to the best - fitting schechter function , which accurately describes the field lf over the observed absolute magnitude range . 
 these very bright galaxies are found in very dense regions of the superclusters and have spectra dominated by an old , red stellar population . in the corona 
 borealis supercluster , the characteristic magnitude @xmath102 is @xmath210 brighter than in the field . 
 @xmath102 for the abell 2069 supercluster is , however , very close to the value in the field . we have also presented suggestive evidence that there is a sharp upturn in the supercluster lf for @xmath215 . 
 while there is also a suggestion of an upturn in the local field galaxy lf for the least luminous galaxies in our survey , it does not appear as dramatic as the upturn seen in the supercluster lf , but more data are needed before the possible difference can be quantified . 
 we are grateful to the kenneth t. and eileen l. norris foundation for their generous grant for construction of the norris spectrograph . 
 we thank the staff of the palomar observatory for the expert assistance we have received during the course of the survey , david hogg for many enlightening discussions , and the referee for a careful reading of this paper and helpful suggestions . 
 this work has been supported by an nsf graduate fellowship ( tas ) and nsf grant ast-92213165 ( wlws ) .","we measure the field galaxy luminosity function ( lf ) as a function of color and redshift from @xmath0 to @xmath1 using galaxies from the norris survey of the corona borealis supercluster . 
 the data set consists of 603 field galaxies with @xmath2 and spans a wide range in apparent magnitude ( @xmath3 ) , although our field galaxy lf analysis is limited to 493 galaxies with @xmath4 . 
 we use the observed @xmath5 colors of the galaxies to compute accurate corrections to the rest @xmath6 and @xmath7 bands . 
 we find that our local @xmath7-band lf , when normalized to counts in high galactic latitude fields , agrees well with the local lf measured in the las campanas redshift survey . 
 our @xmath6-band local lf , however , does not match the @xmath8-band lf from the stromlo / apm survey , having a normalization 1.6 times higher . 
 we see compelling evidence that the @xmath6-band field galaxy lf evolves with redshift . 
 the evolution is strongest for the population of star - forming galaxies with [ ] @xmath93727 rest - frame equivalent widths greater than 10 . 
 the population of red , quiescent galaxies shows no sign of evolution to @xmath1 . 
 the evolution of the lf which we observe is consistent with the findings of other faint galaxy redshift surveys . 
 the fraction of galaxies with [ ] emission increases rapidly with redshift , but the fraction of galaxies with strong h@xmath10 absorption , a signature of a burst of star - formation , does not . 
 we thus conclude that the star formation in distant galaxies is primarily long - lived . 
 we also compute the lfs of the corona borealis supercluster ( @xmath11 , 419 galaxies with @xmath12 ) and the abell 2069 supercluster ( @xmath13 , 318 galaxies with @xmath14 ) . 
 the shapes of the two supercluster luminosity functions are broadly similar to the shape of the local luminosity function . 
 however , there are important differences . 
 both supercluster lfs have an excess of very bright galaxies . 
 in addition , the characteristic magnitude of the corona borealis supercluster lf is roughly half a magnitude brighter than that of the local field galaxy lf , and there is a suggestion of an upturn in the lf for galaxies fainter than @xmath15 .",arxiv
"over the past few years rapidity gaps , i.e. pseudorapidity regions without hadronic activity , have been observed in hadronic collisions at both the hera @xmath7 collider  @xcite and in @xmath8 collisions at the fermilab tevatron  @xcite . 
 such rapidity gaps are widely attributed to the exchange of color singlet quanta between incident partons  @xcite , the exchange of two gluons in a color singlet state being the simplest such model  @xcite . at the tevatron , a fraction @xmath9 of all dijet events with jet transverse energies @xmath10  gev and jet separations of more than three units of pseudorapidity exhibit rapidity gaps between the jets . 
 this observation is particularly striking since it demonstrates that color singlet exchange effects in qcd events are relevant at momentum transfers of order 1,000  gev@xmath6 , raising the hope that perturbative methods can be used for quantitative descriptions . 
 a gap fraction of order one percent was in fact predicted by bjorken  @xcite , in terms of a fraction @xmath11 of dijet events which are due to @xmath0-channel color - singlet exchange and a survival probability @xmath12 of rapidity gaps of order 10%  @xcite , [ eq : ps ] f_gap = f_s p_s . here 
 the survival probability estimates the fraction of hard dijet events without an underlying event , i.e. without soft interactions between the other partons in the scattering hadrons . 
 such multiple interactions would fill the rapidity gap produced in the hard scattering process . 
 for @xmath13 elastic scattering , bjorken estimated the color - singlet fraction @xmath14 in terms of the imaginary part of the two - gluon @xmath0-channel exchange amplitude , which is known to dominate the forward scattering amplitude for @xmath0-channel color - singlet exchange . in impact parameter space , at impact parameters small 
 compared to @xmath15 , the result is f_s^impact & = & 29    & & 12 |433 - 2n_f|^2 = 0.15 . 
 [ eq : fbjorken ] here 2/9 is the relative color factor of the two - gluon color - singlet to the one - gluon color - octet exchange cross section and @xmath16 is an infrared cutoff parameter which regularizes the two - gluon loop - integral . 
 this model for the calulation of the color singlet fraction @xmath14 , with the two gluon - exchange amplitude replaced by its imaginary part , will be called the two - gluon exchange model in the following .    in this model 
 , the color singlet fraction grows with the color charge of the scattered partons . for @xmath2 and @xmath3 elastic scattering @xmath14 
 would be larger by factors @xmath17 and @xmath18 , respectively  @xcite . 
 this results in a substantial decrease of the observable gap fraction as the contribution from gluon induced dijet events is reduced , _ 
 e.g. _ by increasing the average transverse momentum of the observed jets and thereby the feynman-@xmath19 values of the incident partons . 
 such measurements have recently been reported by both the cdf  @xcite and the d0  @xcite collaborations , and no such effect is observed . 
 in fact , the d0 data are compatible with a slight increase of the gap fraction with increasing jet @xmath20 , casting doubt on the validity of the two - gluon exchange model  @xcite .    in this paper 
 we reconsider the basic ideas behind the two - gluon exchange model . 
 we demonstrate its limitations and show that , even when starting from this perturbative picture of rapidity gap formation , the determination of the color singlet exchange fraction @xmath14 is essentially nonperturbative . 
 we start from a basic feature of the two - gluon exchange model : unitarity fixes the imaginary part of the @xmath0-channel two - gluon exchange amplitude in terms of the born amplitude and this imaginary part dominates @xmath0-channel color singlet exchange  @xcite . rewriting this relationship in terms of phase shifts , 
 the one- and two - gluon exchange amplitudes are found to be too large to be compatible with unitarity . 
 phase shift unitarization leads to a more realistic description , in which the total differential cross section remains unchanged compared to the born result , but with @xmath0-channel color singlet exchange fractions which differ substantially from the expectations of the two - gluon exchange model . 
 these features are demonstrated analytically for fixed values of the strong coupling constant , @xmath21 , in section  [ sec2 ] . in section  [ sec3 ] 
 we then perform a numerical analysis for running @xmath21 , showing that the key properties of the fixed-@xmath21 results remain unchanged . 
 the predicted color singlet fractions are found to very strongly depend on the regularization of gluon exchange at small momentum transfer , however , and thus can not be reliably calculated within perturbation theory . 
 within our unitarized model the non - perturbative effects can be summarized in terms of two parameters , the survival probability of gaps , @xmath22 , and a universal coulomb phase shift , @xmath23 . 
 implications for the formation of gaps at the tevatron are analyzed in section  [ sec4 ] . 
 in particular we calculate how the gap fraction between two hard jets varies with jet transverse energies and jet pseudorapidity separation and then compare predicted fractions with tevatron data  @xcite . 
 our conclusions are given in section  [ sec5 ] . 
 consider the elastic scattering of two arbitrary partons , @xmath24 and @xmath25 , p(i_1)+p(j_1)p(i_2)+p(j_2 ) , at momentum transfer @xmath26 . here 
 @xmath27 denote the colors of the initial and final state partons . 
 the cross section and the partial wave amplitudes are completely dominated by the forward region , @xmath28 , where the rutherford scattering amplitude , [ eq : mborn ] m = -8_s t^at^a = 8_s f_c = m_0f_c , provides an excellent approximation . 
 note that helicity is conserved in forward scattering , hence spin need not be considered in the following . 
 the only process dependence arises from the color factor @xmath29 .      in order to study unitarity constraints 
 , we need to diagonalize the amplitude in both momentum / coordinate space and in color space . 
 the first step is most easily achieved by transforming to impact parameter space , [ eq : fourier ] t(*b * ) = ( * q * ) e^-i*q * . neglecting multi - parton production processes , _ 
 i.e. _ inelastic channels , unitarity of the @xmath30-matrix implies the relation [ eq : unitarity1 ] t(*b * ) =    @xmath31 . 
 ( [ eq : unitarity1 ] ) represents a matrix relation in color space . 
 more fully it can be written as t(*b*)_i_2 j_2 , i_1 j_1 = _ i , j t(*b*)_i_2 j_2 , i j t^(*b*)_i j , i_1 j_1 , [ eq : unitarity2 ] where the sum runs over the dimension of the color space , @xmath32 for @xmath33 and @xmath13 scattering and @xmath34 ( 64 ) for @xmath2 ( @xmath3 ) elastic scattering .    since the color factors can be written as hermitian matrices , the right - hand side of eq . 
 ( [ eq : unitarity2 ] ) represents a simple matrix product of the color matrices . 
 this product is easily diagonalized by decomposing the color factors @xmath35 into a linear combination of projection operators onto the irreducible color representations which are accessible in the @xmath36-channel , [ eq : col.factor ] f_c = ( f_c)_i_2j_2,i_1j_1 = _ k f_k ( p_k)_i_2j_2,i_1j_1 = _ k f_k p_k . 
 for the case of quark - antiquark elastic scattering , for example , with color decomposition @xmath37 , the color factor can be written in terms of gell - mann matrices as ( f_c)_i_2j_2,i_1j_1 = ( ^a2 ) _ i_2i_1 ( ^a2 ) _ 
 j_1j_2 = 49_j_1i_1_i_2j_2- 13(^a2 ) _ 
 j_1i_1 ( ^a2 ) _ 
 i_2j_2 = 43p_1 - 16 p_8 . for all cases , @xmath13 , @xmath33 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 elastic scattering , 
 the decomposition into @xmath36-channel projectors is summarized in table  [ tab : colorop ] . 
 this color decomposition , combined with the transformation to impact parameter space , diagonalizes the unitarity relation for elastic scattering amplitudes . 
 .representations and color operators for qcd elastic scattering . 
 the indices of the projection operators @xmath38 in the last column represent the dimensionalities of the irreducible color representations in the @xmath36-channel . 
 results for the @xmath39 decomposition are taken from ref . 
 @xcite . [ cols=""^,<,<,^"",options=""header "" , ] 
 both the d0  @xcite and the cdf  @xcite collaborations at the tevatron have analyzed the fraction of dijet events with rapidity gaps , as a function of both the transverse energy , @xmath20 , and the pseudorapidity separation , @xmath40 , of the two jets . 
 as these phase space variables change , the composition of dijet events varies , from mostly gluon initiated processes at small @xmath20 and @xmath41 ( and , hence , small feynman-@xmath19 , @xmath42 ) to @xmath13 scattering at large values . 
 a dependence of the gap fraction on the color structure of the scattering partons would thus be reflected in a variation with @xmath20 and @xmath41 . 
 bjorken s two gluon exchange model , which is equivalent to the small @xmath43 region in our analysis , predicts a larger fraction of color singlet exchange events for gluon initiated processes  @xcite ( see fig .  [ 
 fig : fs.vs.psi ] for @xmath44 ) . 
 the gap fraction should thus decrease with increasing @xmath20 or @xmath41 . 
 the opposite behavior is expected in statistical models of color rearrangement  @xcite . here 
 the eight color degrees of freedom for gluons , as compared to three for quarks , make it less likely for gluon initiated processes that @xmath0-channel color singlet exchange is achieved by random color rearrangement . 
 this would lead to a smaller gap fraction at small @xmath42 and therefore small @xmath20 or @xmath41 .    in the unitarized rpwe framework , 
 the dependence on the regularization parameters is sufficiently strong to encompass both scenarios . 
 this is demonstrated in figs . 
 [ fig : fgap.exp.d0 ] and [ fig : fgap.exp.cdf ] , where the results of the running coupling analysis for three choices of the regularization parameters are compared with tevatron data , taken at @xmath45  gev . 
 the data correspond to dijet events with two opposite hemisphere jets of @xmath46  gev , @xmath47 ( cdf ) or @xmath48  gev , @xmath49 ( d0 ) . 
 d0 data are taken from ref . 
 @xcite and show the fraction of dijet events with rapidity gaps . 
 cdf  @xcite shows the ratio of gap fractions in individual @xmath41 and @xmath20 bins to the overall gap fraction in the acceptance region . for comparing our calculation with the data we fix the survival probability @xmath22 in eq . 
 ( [ eq : ps ] ) to reproduce the overall gap fraction in the acceptance region , which was measured as @xmath50 for the d0 sample and @xmath51 for the cdf sample . 
 required survival probabilities strongly depend on regularization parameters and vary between 1.9% and 5.5% , which is on the low side of previous estimates  @xcite . for a given choice of regularization parameters , predictions for the @xmath20 or @xmath41 dependence of the gap fraction 
 are quite similar for the cdf and d0 cuts . to the extent that the two data sets are consistent within errors , it is not yet possible to discriminate between different choices of regularization parameters , i.e. to obtain sensitivity to the non - perturbative dynamics . 
 d0 data somewhat favor color singlet fractions which grow with @xmath42 and which are more in line with expectations from color evaporation models  @xcite . note that our unitarized gluon exchange model , with @xmath52  gev and @xmath53  gev is able to describe this trend , even though it is an extension of the two - gluon exchange model . 
 cdf data slightly prefer a gap fraction which decreases with increasing @xmath41 and , hence , with larger @xmath42 . the unitarized gluon exchange model , with @xmath54  gev and @xmath55  gev describes such a situation . 
 comparison with fig . 
 [ fig : fs.reg.dep ] shows that this set of parameters predicts a much smaller gap fraction for @xmath13 scattering than for gluon initiated processes , which is qualitatively similar to the two - gluon exchange model  @xcite . 
 indeed , the shape of the gap fraction for the two gluon exchange model is very similar to the long - dashed curves in fig .  [ 
 fig : fgap.exp.cdf ] . 
 clearly , the data are not yet precise enough to unambiguously distinguish between these different scenarios . on the theoretical side , 
 the variation of the rpwe predictions with model parameters highlights the limitations of a perturbative approach to the color singlet exchange probability . taking the phase @xmath23 and the survival probability @xmath22 as free parameters , 
 the unitarized two - gluon exchange model is clearly capable of fitting the present tevatron data , however . 
 the formation of rapidity gaps in hadronic scattering events is a common occurrence , and its ubiquity asks for a theoretical explanation within qcd . 
 the formation of gaps between two hard jets at the tevatron is particularly intriguing and is commonly being explained in terms of color singlet exchange in the @xmath0-channel , be it via an effective color singlet object like the `` pomeron '' or via a statistical color rearrangement , in terms of multiple soft gluon exchange . 
 `` pomeron '' exchange models build on the observation that color singlet exchange in the @xmath0-channel can be achieved in qcd via the exchange of two gluons , with compensating colors  @xcite . 
 when trying to build a quantitative model for the formation of rapidity gaps  @xcite , one encounters infrared divergences in the color singlet hard scattering amplitude , which in a full treatment would be regularized by the finite size and the color singlet nature of physical hadrons  @xcite . in turn , this indicates that non - perturbative information may be indispensable for a quantitative understanding of the hard color singlet exchange process . 
 we have analyzed this question within a particular model , based on the unitarization of single gluon exchange in the @xmath0-channel . 
 the low - nussinov model  @xcite corresponds to a truncation of the unitarization at order @xmath56 . 
 we find that , for any reasonable range of regularization parameters , the two - gluon exchange approximation violates partial wave unitarity , and thus a fully unitarized amplitude is needed for phenomenological applications . 
 the unitarization of hard elastic quark and gluon scattering is not unique , of course , but any acceptable method must preserve the successful description of hard dijet events by perturbative qcd . 
 the phase shift approach used here fulfills this requirement : the unitarization does not change the born - level predictions for the color averaged differential cross sections . as a corollary , 
 the color - inclusive dijet cross section is independent of the regularization parameters which need to be introduced for the full phase shift analysis . 
 the situation is entirely different when considering the @xmath0-channel color singlet exchange component which is introduced by the exchange of two or more gluons or by unitarization . 
 the @xmath0-channel color singlet exchange fraction , @xmath14 , is strongly affected by the full unitarization and deviates from the expectations of the two - gluon exchange approximation , changing even the qualitative predictions of the low - nussinov model . 
 these strong unitarization effects are reflected by a strong dependence on the precise regularization procedure . 
 this cutoff dependence , which parameterizes non - perturbative effects , does not allow to make quantitative predictions for the color singlet exchange fractions in particular partonic subprocesses . 
 these limitations , which have been demonstrated here for the two - gluon exchange approximation to the pomeron , may be generic to pomeron exchange models , and should be analyzed more generally .    in spite of these limitations , we find some intriguing features of the unitarized gluon exchange amplitudes . 
 for all partonic subprocesses and for all regularization parameters , the color singlet exchange fractions can be described in terms of a single universal phase , @xmath57 , which absorbs all non - perturbative effects . 
 this suggests a unified phenomenological description of the rapidity gap data , via the gap survival probability @xmath22 and the phase @xmath57 . 
 such an analysis goes beyond the transverse momentum and pseudorapidity dependence of rapidity gap fractions which have just become available , and should best be performed directly by the experimental collaborations .

"lease take a look at the images in the top row of fig . 
 [ fig : fig1 ] . 
 which object stands out the most ( i.e. , is the most salient one ) in each of these scenes ? 
 the answer is trivial . 
 there is only one object , thus it is the most salient one . 
 now , look at the images in the third row . 
 these scenes are much more complex and contain several objects , thus it is more challenging for a vision system to select the most salient object . 
 this problem , known as _ salient object detection ( and segmentation ) _ , has recently attracted a great deal of interest in computer vision community . 
 the goal is to simulate the astonishing capability of human attention in prioritizing objects for high - level processing . 
 such a capability has several applications in recognition ( e.g. ,  @xcite ) , image and video compression ( e.g. ,  @xcite ) , video summarization ( e.g. ,  @xcite , media re - targeting and photo collage ( e.g. ,  @xcite ) , image quality assessment ( e.g. ,  @xcite ) , image segmentation ( e.g. ,  @xcite ) , content - based image retrieval and image collection browsing ( e.g. ,  @xcite ) , image editing and manipulating ( e.g. ,  @xcite ) , visual tracking ( e.g. ,  @xcite ) , object discovery ( e.g. ,  @xcite ) , and human - robot interaction ( e.g. ,  @xcite ) .    a large number of saliency detection methods have been proposed in the past 7 years ( since  @xcite ) . in general , a salient object detection model involves two steps : 1 ) _ selecting objects to process _ 
 ( i.e. , determining saliency order of objects ) , and 2 ) _ segmenting the object area _ 
 ( i.e. , isolating the object and its boundary ) . 
 so far , models have bypassed the first challenge by focusing on scenes with single objects ( see fig .  [ 
 fig : fig1 ] ) . 
 they do a decent job on the second step as witnessed by very high performances on existing biased datasets ( e.g. , on asd dataset  @xcite ) which contain low - clutter images with often a single object at the center . 
 however , it is unclear how current models perform on complex cluttered scenes with several objects . despite the volume of past research 
 , this trend has not been yet fully pursued , mainly due to the lack of two ingredients : 1 ) suitable benchmark datasets for scaling up models and model development , and 2 ) a widely - agreed objective definition of the most salient object . in this paper 
 , we strive to provide solutions for these problems . 
 further , we aim to discover which component might be the weakest link in the possible failure of models when migrating to complex scenes .    some related topics , closely or remotely , to visual saliency modeling and salient object detection include : object importance  @xcite , object proposal generation  @xcite , memorability  @xcite , scene clutter  @xcite , image interestingness  @xcite , video interestingness  @xcite , surprise  @xcite , image quality assessment  @xcite , scene typicality  @xcite , aesthetic  @xcite , and attributes  @xcite . 
 one of the earliest models , which generated the _ first wave _ of interest in image saliency in computer vision and neuroscience communities , was proposed by itti _ 
 et al . _ 
 this model was an implementation of earlier general computational frameworks and psychological theories of bottom - up attention based on center - surround mechanisms . in  @xcite , 
 itti _ et al . 
 _ showed examples where their model was able to detect spatial discontinuities in scenes . 
 subsequent behavioral ( e.g. ,  @xcite ) and computational studies ( e.g. ,  @xcite ) started to predict fixations with saliency models to verify models and to understand human visual attention . 
 second wave _ of interest appeared with works of liu _ et al . _ 
 @xcite and achanta _ et al . _ 
 @xcite who treated saliency detection as a binary segmentation problem with 1 for a foreground pixel and 0 for a pixel of the background region . 
 since then it has been less clear where this new definition stands as it shares many concepts with other well - established computer vision areas such as general segmentation algorithms ( e.g. ,  @xcite ) , category independent object proposals ( e.g. ,  @xcite ) , fixation prediction saliency models ( e.g.  @xcite ) , and general object detection methods . 
 this is partly because current datasets have shaped a definition for this problem , which might not totally reflect full potential of models to _ select and segment salient objects in an image with an arbitrary level of complexity_.        reviewing all saliency detection models goes beyond the scope of this paper ( see  @xcite ) . 
 some breakthrough efforts are as follows . 
 et al . _ 
 @xcite introduced a conditional random field ( crf ) framework to combine multi - scale contrast and local contrast based on surrounding , context , and color spatial distributions for binary saliency estimation . 
 et al . _ 
 @xcite proposed subtracting the average color from the low - pass filtered input for saliency detection . 
 et al . _ 
 @xcite used a patch - based approach to incorporate global context , aiming to detect image regions that represent the scene . 
 et al . _ 
 @xcite proposed a region contrast - based method to measure global contrast in the lab color space . in  @xcite , 
 wang _ et al . _ estimated local saliency , leveraging a dictionary learned from other images , and global saliency using a dictionary learned from other patches of the same image . 
 et al . _ 
 @xcite observed that decomposing an image into perceptually uniform regions , which abstracts away unnecessary details , is important for high quality saliency detection . in  @xcite , 
 et al . _ utilized the difference between the color histogram of a region and its immediately neighboring regions for measuring saliency . 
 et al . _ 
 @xcite defined a measure of saliency as the cost of composing an image window using the remaining parts of the image , and tested it on pascal voc dataset  @xcite . 
 this method , in its essence , follows the same goal as in  @xcite . 
 et al . _ 
 @xcite proposed a graphical model for fusing generic objectness  @xcite and visual saliency for salient object detection . 
 shen and wu  @xcite modeled an image as a low - rank matrix ( background ) plus sparse noises ( salient regions ) in a feature space . 
 more recently , margolin _ et al . _  @xcite integrated pattern and color distinctnesses with high - level cues to measure saliency of an image patch . 
 some studies have considered the relationship between fixations and salincy judgments similar to  @xcite . 
 for example , xu et al . 
 @xcite investigated the role of high - level semantic knowledge ( e.g. , object operability , watchability , gaze direction ) and object information ( e.g. , object center - bias ) for fixation prediction in free viewing of natural scenes . 
 they constructed a large dataset called `` object and semantic images and eye - tracking ( osie ) '' . 
 indeed they found an added value for this information for fixation prediction and proposed a regression model ( to find combination weights for different cues ) that improves fixation prediction performance . 
 koehler et al . 
 @xcite collected a dataset known as the ucsb dataset . 
 this dataset contains 800 images . 
 one hundred observers performed an explicit saliency judgment task , 22 observers performed a free viewing task , 20 observers performed a saliency search task , and 38 observers performed a cued object search task . 
 observers completing the free viewing task were instructed to freely view the images . in the explicit saliency judgment task , observers were instructed to view a picture on a computer monitor and click on the object or area in the image that was most salient to them . _ salient _ was explained to observers as something that stood out or caught their eye ( similar to  @xcite ) . 
 observers in the saliency search task were instructed to determine whether or not the most salient object or location in an image was on the left or right half of the scene . 
 finally , observers who performed the cued object search task were asked to determine whether or not a target object was present in the image . 
 then , they conducted a benchmark and introduced models that perform the best on each of these tasks . 
 a similar line of work to ours in this paper has been proposed by mishra _ 
 et al . _ 
 @xcite where they combined monocular cues ( color , intensity , and texture ) with stereo and motion features to segment a region given an initial user - specified seed point , practically ignoring the first stage in saliency detection ( which we address here by automatically generating a seed point ) . 
 ultimately , our attempt in this work is to bridge the interactive segmentation algorithms ( e.g. ,  @xcite ) and saliency detection models and help transcend their applicability . 
 perhaps the most similar work to ours has been published by li _ 
 _  @xcite . in their work , they offer two contributions . _ first _ , they collect an eye movement dataset using annotated images from the pascal dataset  @xcite and call their dataset pascal - s . 
 _ second _ , they propose a model that outperforms other state - of - the - art salient object detection models on this dataset ( as well as four other benchmark datasets ) . 
 their model decouples the salient object detection problem into two processes : 1 ) _ a segment generation process _ , followed by 2 ) _ a saliency scoring mechanism _ using fixation prediction . here , 
 similar to li _ et al . 
 _ , we also take advantage of eye movements to measure object saliency but instead of first fully segmenting the scene , we perform a shallow segmentation using superpixels . 
 we then only focus on segmenting the object that is most likely to attract attention . 
 in other words , the two steps are similar to li _ et al . _ but are performed in the reverse order . 
 this can potentially lead to better efficiency as the first expensive segmentation part is now only an approximation . 
 we also offer another dataset which is complimentary to li _ et al . 
 _ s dataset and together both datasets ( and models ) could hopefully lead to a paradigm shift in the salient object detection field to avoid using simple biased datasets . 
 further , we situate this field among other similar fields such as general object detection and segmentation , objectness proposal generation models , and saliency models for fixation prediction . 
 several salient object detection datasets have been created as more models have been introduced in the literature to extend capabilities of models to more complex scenes . 
 table  [ tab : db ] lists properties of 19 popular salient object detection datasets . although these datasets suffer from some biases ( e.g. , low scene clutter , center - bias , uniform backgrounds , and non - ambiguous objects ) , they have been very influential for the past progress . 
 unfortunately , recent efforts to extend existing datasets have only increased the number of images without really addressing core issues specifically background clutter and number of objects . 
 majority of datasets ( in particular large scale ones such as those derived from the msra dataset ) have scenes with often one object which is usually located at the image center . 
 this has made model evaluation challenging since some high - performing models that emphasize image center fail in detecting and segmenting the most salient off - center object  @xcite . 
 we believe that now is the time to move on to more versatile datasets and remedy biases in salient object datasets . 
 in this section , we briefly explain how salient object detection models differ from fixation prediction models , what people consider the most salient object when they are explicitly asked to choose one , what are the relationships between these judgments and eye movements , and what salient object detection models actually predict . 
 we investigate properties of salient objects from humans point of view when they are explicitly asked to choose such objects . 
 we then study whether ( and to what extent ) saliency judgments agree with eye movements . while it has been assumed that eye movements are indicators of salient objects , so far few studies ( e.g. ,  @xcite ) have directly and quantitatively confirmed this assumption . 
 moreover , the level of agreement and cases of disagreement between fixations and saliency judgments have not been fully explored . 
 some studies ( e.g. ,  @xcite ) , have shown that human observers choose to annotate salient objects or regions first but they have not asked humans explicitly ( labelme data was analyzed in  @xcite ) and they have ignored eye movements . knowing which objects humans consider as salient is specially crucial when outputs of a model are going to be interpreted by humans . 
 there are two major differences between models defining saliency as `` where people look '' and models defining saliency as `` which objects stand out '' . 
 _ first _ , the former models aim to predict points that people look in free - viewing of natural scenes usually for 3 to 5 seconds while the latter aim to detect and segment salient objects ( by drawing pixel - accurate silhouettes around them ) . in principle a model that scores well on one problem should not score very well on the other . an optimal model for fixation prediction should only highlight those points that a viewer will look at ( few points inside an object and not the whole object region ) . 
 since salient object detection models aim to segment the whole object region they will generate a lot of false positives ( these points belong to the object but viewers may not fixate at them ) when it comes to fixation prediction . on the contrary 
 , a fixation prediction model will miss a lot of points inside the object ( i.e. , false negatives ) when it comes to segmentation . 
 _ second _ , due to noise in eye tracking or observers saccade landing ( typically around 1 degrees and @xmath0 30 pixels ) , highly accurate pixel - level prediction maps are less desired . 
 in fact , due to these noises , sometimes blurring prediction maps increases the scores  @xcite . on the contrary , producing salient object detection maps that can accurately distinguish object boundaries are highly desirable specially in applications . due to these 
 , different evaluation and benchmarks have been developed for comparing models in these two categories .    in practice , 
 models , whether they address segmentation or fixation prediction , are applicable interchangeably as both entail generating similar saliency maps . 
 for example , several researches have been thresholding saliency maps of their models , originally designed to predict fixations , to detect and segment salient proto - objects ( e.g. ,  @xcite ) .          in our previous study 
 @xcite , we addressed what people consider as the most outstanding ( i.e. , salient ) object in a scene . while in  @xcite we studied the explicit saliency problem from a behavioral perspective , here we are mainly interested in constructing computational models for automatic salient object detection in arbitrary visual scenes . 
 a total of 70 students ( 13 male , 57 female ) undergraduate usc students with normal or corrected - to - normal vision in the age range between 18 and 23 ( mean = 19.7 , std = 1.4 ) were asked to draw a polygon around the object that stood out the most . 
 participants annotations were supposed not to be too loose ( general ) or too tight ( specific ) around the object . 
 they were shown an illustrative example for this purpose . 
 participants were able to relocate their drawn polygon from one object to another or modify its outline . 
 we were concerned with the case of selection of the single most salient object in an image . 
 stimuli were the images from the dataset by bruce and tsotsos ( 2005 )  @xcite 681 pixels . 
 images in this dataset have been presented at random to 20 observers ( in a free - viewing task ) for 4 sec each , with 2 sec of delay ( a gray mask ) in between . ] . 
 see fig . 
 [ fig : sampleio - am ] for sample images from this dataset . 
 we first measured the degree to which annotations of participants agree with each other using the following quantitative measure : @xmath1    where @xmath2 and @xmath3 are annotations of @xmath4-th and @xmath5-th participants , respectively ( out of @xmath6 participants ) over the @xmath7-th image . above measure 
 has the well - defined lower - bound of 0 , when there is no overlap in segmentations of users , and the upper - bound of 1 , when segmentations have perfect overlap . 
 [ fig : exp1].left shows histogram of @xmath8 values . 
 participants had moderate agreement with each other ( mean @xmath9 ; std @xmath10 ; significantly above chance ) . 
 inspection of images with lowest @xmath8 values shows that these scenes had several foreground objects while images with highest annotation agreement had often one visually distinct salient object ( e.g. , a sign , a person , or an animal ; see fig .  [ 
 fig : sampleio - am ] ) . 
 we also investigated the relationship between explicit saliency judgments and freeviewing fixations as two indicators of visual attention . 
 here we used shuffled auc ( sauc ) score to tackle center - bias in eye movement data  @xcite . for each of 120 images , we showed that a map built from annotations of 70 participants explains fixations of free viewing observers significantly above chance ( sauc of @xmath11 , chance @xmath12 , @xmath13-test @xmath14 ; fig . 
 [ fig : exp1].right ) . 
 the prediction power of this map was as good as the itti98 model  @xcite . 
 hence , we concluded that explicit saliency judgments agree with fixations . 
 [ fig : sampleio - am ] shows high- and low - agreement cases between fixations and annotations .    here 
 , we merge annotations of all 70 participants on each image , normalize the resultant map to [ 0 1 ] , and threshold it at 0.7 to build our first benchmark saliency detection dataset ( called bruce - a ) . 
 prevalent objects in bruce and tsotsos dataset are man - made home supplies in indoor scenes ( see  @xcite for more details on this dataset ) . 
 similar results , to link fixations with salient objects , have been reported by koehler _ 
 _  @xcite . as in  @xcite 
 , they asked observers to click on salient locations in natural scenes . 
 they showed high correlation between clicked locations and observers eye movements ( from a different group of subjects ) in free - viewing . while the most salient  @xcite , important  @xcite , or interesting  @xcite object may tell us a lot about a scene , eventually there is a subset of objects that can minimally describe a scene . 
 this has been addressed in the past somewhat indirectly in the contexts of saliency  @xcite , language and attention  @xcite , and phrasal recognition  @xcite . 
 based on results from our saliency judgment experiment  @xcite , we then decided to annotate scenes of the dataset by judd _ 
 et al . _ 
 the reason for choosing this dataset is because it is currently the most popular dataset for benchmarking fixation prediction models  @xcite . 
 it contains eye movements of 15 observers freely viewing 1003 scenes from variety of topics . 
 thus , using fixations we can easily determine which object , out of several annotated objects , is the most salient one . 
 we only used 900 images from the judd dataset and discarded images without well - defined objects ( e.g. , mosaic tiles , flames ) or images with very cluttered backgrounds ( e.g. , nature scenes ) . figure  [ fig : figdiscarded ] shows examples of discarded scenes . 
 we asked 2 observers to manually outline objects using the labelme  @xcite open annotation tool ( http://new-labelme.csail.mit.edu/ ) . 
 observers were instructed to accurately segment as many objects as possible following three rules : 1 ) discard reflection of objects in mirrors , 2 ) segment objects that are not separable as one ( e.g. , apples in a basket ) , and 3 ) interpolate the boundary of occluded objects only if doing otherwise may create several parts for an occluded object . 
 these cases , however , did happen rarely . 
 observers were also told that their outline should be good enough for somebody to recognize the object just by seeing the drawn polygon . 
 observers were paid for their effort . 
 [ fig:1 ] shows sample images and their annotated objects . to determine which object is the most salient one , we selected the object at the peak of the human fixation map .          here 
 we explore some summary statistics of our data . on average , 
 36.93% of an image pixels was annotated by the 1st observer with a std of 29.33% ( 44.52% , std=29.36% for the 2nd observer ) . 
 27.33% of images had more than 50% of their pixels segmented by the 1st observer ( 34.18% for the 2nd ) . the number of annotated objects in a scene ranged from 1 to 31 with median of 3 for the 1st observer ( 1 to 24 for the 2nd observer with median of 4 ; fig . 
 [ fig : stat].left ) . 
 the median object size was 10% of the total image area for the 1st observer ( 9% for the 2nd observer ) . 
 [ fig : stat].left ( inset ) shows the average annotation map for each observer over all images . 
 it indicates that either more objects were present at the image center and/or observers tended to annotate central objects more . 
 overall , our data suggests that both observers agree to a good extent with each other . 
 finally , in order to create one ground truth segmentation map per image , we asked 5 other observers to choose the best of two annotations ( criteria based on selection of annotated objects and boundary accuracy ) . 
 the best annotation was the one with max number of votes ( 611 images with 4 to 1 votes ) . 
 next , we quantitatively analyzed the relationship between fixations and annotations ( note that we explicitly define the most salient object as the one with the highest fraction of fixations on it ) . 
 we first looked into the relationship between the object annotation order and the fraction of fixations on objects . 
 [ fig : stat].middle shows fraction of fixations as a function of object annotation order . in alignment with previous findings  @xcite we observe that observers chose to annotate objects that attract more fixations . but 
 here , unlike  @xcite which used saliency models to demonstrate that observers prioritize annotating interesting and salient objects , we used actual eye movement data . 
 we also quantized the fraction of fixations that fall on scene objects over the judd - a annotations , and observed that in about 55% of images , the most salient object attracts more than 50% of fixations ( mean fixation ratio of 0.54 ; image background=0.45 ; fig . 
 [ fig : stat].right ) . 
 the most salient object ranged in size from 0.1% to 90.2% of the image size ( median=10.17% ) . 
 the min and max aspect ratio ( w / h ) of bounding boxes fitted to the most salient object were 0.04 and 13.7 , respectively ( median=0.94 ) . 
 judd dataset is known to be highly center - biased  @xcite , in terms of eye movements  @xcite , due to two factors : 1 ) the tendency of observers to start viewing the image from the center ( a.k.a viewing strategy ) , and 2 ) tendency of photographers to frame interesting objects at the image center ( a.k.a photographer bias ) . here 
 we verify the second factor by showing the average annotation map of the most salient object in fig . 
 [ fig : meps ] . our datasets seem to have relatively less center - bias compared to msra-5k and cssd datasets . 
 note that other datasets mentioned in table i are also highly center - biased . to count the number of images with salient objects at the image center , we defined the following criterion . 
 an image is on - centered if its most salient object overlaps with a normalized ( to [ 0 1 ] ) central gaussian filter with @xmath15 . 
 this gaussian filter is resized to the image size and is then truncated above 0.95 . utilizing this criterion 
 , we selected 667 and 223 on - centered and off - centered scenes , respectively . 
 partitioning data in this manner helps scrutinize performance of models and tackle the problem of center - bias .    to further explore the amount of center - bias in bruce - a and judd - a datasets , we first calculated the euclidean distance from center of bounding boxes , fitted to object masks , to the image center . 
 we then normalized this distance to the half of the image diagonal ( i.e. , image corner to image center ) . 
 [ fig : arearatio].left shows the distribution of normalized object distances . 
 as opposed to msra-5k and cssd datasets that show an unusual peak around the image center , objects in our datasets are further apart from the image center . 
 [ fig : arearatio].right shows distributions of normalized object sizes . 
 a majority of salient objects in bruce - a and judd - a datasets occupy less than 10% of the image . on average , objects in our datasets are smaller than msra-5k and cssd making salient object detection more challenging . 
 we also analyzed complexity of scenes on four datasets . to this end 
 , we first used the popular graph - based superpixel segmentation algorithm by felzenszwalb and huttenlocher  @xcite to segment an image into contiguous regions larger than 60 pixels each ( parameter settings : @xmath16 = 1 , segmentation coefficient @xmath17 = 300 ) . 
 the basic idea is that the more superpixels an image contains , the more complex and cluttered it is  @xcite . by analogy to scenes , an object with several superpixels is less homogeneous , and hence is more complex ( e.g. , a person vs. a ball ) . 
 [ fig : stats ] shows distributions of number of superpixels on the most salient object , the background , and the entire scene . 
 if a superpixel overlapped with the salient object and background , we counted it for both . 
 in general , complexities of backgrounds and whole scenes in our datasets , represented by blue and red curves , are much higher than in the other two datasets . 
 the most salient object in judd - a dataset on average contains more superpixels than salient objects in msra-5k and cssd datasets , even with smaller objects . 
 the reason why number of superpixels is low on the bruce - a dataset is because of its very small salient objects ( see fig .  [ 
 fig : stats].right ) .    further , we inspected types of objects in judd - a images . 
 we found that 45% of images have at least one person in them and 27.2% have more than two people . on average 
 each scene has 1.56 persons ( std = 3.2 ) . in about 27% of images , annotators chose a person as the most salient object . 
 we also found that 280 out of 900 images ( 31.1% ) had one or more text in them . 
 other frequent objects were animals , cars , faces , flowers , and signs . 
 in general , it is agreed that for good saliency detection , a model should meet the following three criteria : 1 ) _ high detection rate_. there should be a low probability of failing to detect real salient regions , and low probability of falsely detecting background regions as salient regions , 2 ) _ high resolution_. saliency maps should have high or full resolution to accurately locate salient objects and retain original image information as much as possible , and 3 ) _ high computational efficiency_. saliency models with low processing time are preferred . here , we analyze these factors by proposing a simple baseline salient object detection model .    we propose a straightforward model to serve two purposes : 1 ) _ to assess the degree to which our data can be explained by a simple model_. this way our model can be used for measuring bias and complexity of a saliency dataset , and 2 ) _ to gauge progress and performance of the state of the art models_. by comparing performance of best models relative to this baseline model over existing datasets and our datasets , we can judge how powerful and scalable these models are . note that we deliberately keep the model simple to achieve above goals . 
 our model involves the following two steps : + _ * step 1 * _ : given an input image , we compute a saliency map and an over - segmented region map . 
 for the former , we use a fixation prediction model ( traditional saliency models ) to find spatial outliers in scenes that attract human eye movements and visual attention . here , we use two models for this purpose : aws  @xcite and hounips  @xcite , which have been shown to perform very well in recent benchmarks and to be computationally efficient  @xcite . as controls , we also use the generic _ objectness _ measure by alexe _ 
 et al . _ 
 @xcite , as well as the human fixation map to determine the upper - bound performance . 
 the reason for using fixation saliency models is to obtain an quick initial estimation of locations where people may look in the hope of finding the most salient object . 
 these regions are then fed to the segmentation component in the next step . 
 it is critical to first limit the subsequent expensive processes onto the right region . 
 for the latter , as in the previous section , we use the fast and robust algorithm by felzenszwalb and huttenlocher  @xcite with same parameters as in section  [ statistics ] . 
 _ * step 2 * _ : the saliency map is first normalized to [ 0 1 ] and is then thresholded at @xmath18 ( here @xmath18 = 0.7 ) 
 . then all unique image superpixels that spatially overlap with the truncated saliency map are included . 
 here we discarded those superpixels that touch the image boundary because they are highly likely to be part of the background . 
 finally , after this process , the holes inside the selected region will be considered as part of the salient object ( e.g. , filling in operation ) . 
 [ fig : samples ] illustrates the process of segmentation and shows outputs of our model for some images from msra-5k , bruce - a , and judd - a datasets . 
 the essential feature of our simple model is dissociating saliency detection from segmentation , such that now it is possible to pinpoint what might be the cause of mistakes or low performance of a model , i.e. , or . 
 this is particularly important since almost all models have confused these two steps and have faded the boundary . 
 note that currently there is no training stage in our model and it is manually constructed with fixed parameters . 
 the second stage in our model is where more modeling contribution can be made , for example by devising more elaborate ways to include or discard superpixels in the final segmentation . 
 one strategy is to learn model parameters from data . 
 some features to include in a learning method are size and position of a superpixel , a measure of elongatedness , a measure of concavity or convexity , distance between feature distributions of a superpixel and its neighbors , etc . to some extent , 
 some of these these features have already been utilized in previous models  @xcite . 
 another direction will be expanding our model to multi scale ( similar to  @xcite ) . 
 we exhaustively compared our model to 8 state of the art methods which have been shown to perform very well on previous benchmarks  @xcite . 
 these models come from 3 categories allowing us to perform cross - category comparison : 1 ) _ salient object detection models _ including cbsal  @xcite , svo  @xcite , pca  @xcite , goferman  @xcite , and fts  @xcite , 2 ) _ generic objectness measure _ by alexe _ 
 et al . _ 
 @xcite , and 3 ) _ fixation prediction models _ including aws  @xcite and hounips  @xcite . 
 we use two widely adopted metrics :    * * precision - recall ( pr ) curve : * for a saliency map @xmath19 normalized to @xmath20 $ ] , we convert it to a binary mask @xmath21 with a threshold @xmath22 . @xmath23 and @xmath24 are then computed as follows given the ground truth mask @xmath25 : @xmath26 [ eqn : precision_recall ] to measure the quality of saliency maps produced by several algorithms , we vary the threshold @xmath22 from 0 to 255 . on each threshold , @xmath23 and @xmath24 values 
 are computed . 
 finally , we can get a precision - recall ( pr ) curve to describe the performance of different algorithms . 
 + we also report the f - measure defined as : @xmath27 + here , as in  @xcite and  @xcite , we set @xmath28 to weigh precision more than recall . * * receiver operating characteristics ( roc ) curve : * we also report the false positive rate ( @xmath29 ) and true positive rate ( @xmath30 ) during the thresholding a saliency map : @xmath31 where @xmath32 and @xmath33 denote the opposite ( complement ) of the binary mask @xmath21 and ground - truth , respectively . 
 the roc curve is the plot of @xmath30 versus @xmath29 by varying the threshold @xmath22 . 
 results are shown in fig . 
 [ fig : bruce ] . 
 consistent with previous reports over the msra-5k dataset  @xcite , cbsal , pca , svo , and alexe models rank on the top ( with f - measures above 0.55 and aucs above 0.90 ) . 
 fixation prediction models perform lower at the level of the map . 
 fts model ranked on the bottom again in alignment with previous results . 
 our models work on par with the best models on this dataset with all f - measures above 0.70 ( max with alexe model about 0.73 ) . moving from this simple dataset ( because our simple models ranked on the top ; see also the analysis in section  [ statistics ] ) to more complex datasets ( middle column in fig . 
 [ fig : bruce ] ) we observed a dramatic drop in performance of all models . 
 the best performance now is 0.24 belonging to the pca model . 
 we observed about 72% drop in performance averaged over 5 models ( cbsal , fts , svo , pca , and alexe ) from msra-5k to bruce - a dataset . 
 note in particular how map model is severely degraded here ( poorest with f measure of 0.1 ) since objects are now less at the center . 
 our best model on this dataset is the salbase - human ( f - measure about 0.31 ) . 
 surprisingly , auc results are still high on this dataset since objects are small thus true positive rate is high at all levels of false positive rate ( see also performance of map ) . patterns of results over judd - a dataset are similar to those over bruce - a with all of our models performing higher than others . 
 the lowest performance here belongs to fts followed by the two fixation prediction models . 
 our salbase - human model scores the best with the f - measure about 0.55 . among our models that used a model to pick the most salient location , salbase - aws scores higher over bruce - 
 a and judd - a datasets possibly because aws is better able to find the most salient location . 
 the average drop from msra-5k to judd - a dataset is @xmath0 41% ( for 5 saliency detection models ) . 
 [ fig : f - measure2 ] shows that these findings are robust to f - measure parameterization .

 performance of the best model is highlighted in boldface font . [ cols=""^,^,^,^ "" , ]      to study the dependency of results on saliency map thresholding ( i.e. , how many superpixels to include ) , we varied the saliency threshold @xmath18 and calculated f - measure for salbase - human and salbase - aws models ( see fig . 
 [ fig : salthreshold ] ) . 
 we observed that even higher scores are achievable using different parameters . 
 for example , since objects in the judd - a dataset are larger , a lower threshold yields a better accuracy . 
 the opposite holds over the bruce - a dataset .      to investigate the dependency of results on segmentation parameters 
 , we varied the parameters of the segmentation algorithm from too fine ( @xmath16 = 1 , k = 100 , min = 20 ; many segments ; over - segmenting ) to too coarse ( @xmath16 = 1 , k = 1000 , min = 800 ; fewer segments ; under - segmenting ) . 
 both of these settings yielded lower performances than results in fig .  [ 
 fig : bruce ] . results with another parameter setting with @xmath16 = 1 , k = 500 , and min = 50 are shown in fig . 
 [ fig : res_500_50 ] . scores and trends are similar to those shown in fig . 
 [ fig : bruce ] , with salbase - human and salbase - aws being the top contenders .    . 
 stars correspond to points shown in fig . 
 [ fig : bruce ] . note that even higher accuracies are possible with different thresholds over our datasets . 
 corresponding f - measure values over msra-5k for salbase - aws model are : 0.62 , 0.67 , 0.70 , 0.73 , and 0.62.,width=321,height=143 ]      analysis of cases where our model fails , shown in fig . 
 [ fig : failure2 ] , reveals four reasons : _ first _ , on bruce - a dataset when humans look at an object more but annotators chose a different object . 
 _ second _ , when a segment that touches the image border is part of the salient object . 
 _ third _ , when the object segment falls outside the thresholded saliency map ( or a wrong one is included ) . 
 _ fourth _ , when the first stage ( i.e. , fixation prediction model ) pick the wrong object as the most salient one ( see fig . 
 [ fig : rrr ] , first column ) . regarding the first problem , 
 care must be taken in assuming what people look is what they choose as the most salient object . 
 although this assumption is correct in a majority of cases ( fig . 
 [ fig : exp1 ] ) , it does not hold in some cases . 
 with respect to the second and third problems , future modeling effort is needed to decide which superpixels to include / discard to determine the extent of an object . 
 the fourth problem points toward shortcomings of fixation prediction models . 
 indeed , in several scenes where our model failed , people and text were the most salient objects . 
 person and text detectors were not utilized in the saliency models employed here . 
 [ fig : rrr ] shows a visual comparison of models over 12 scenes from the judd - a dataset . 
 cbsal and svo generate more visually pleasant maps . 
 goferman highlights object boundaries more than object interiors . 
 pca generates center - biased maps . some models ( e.g. , goferman , fts ) generate sparse saliency maps while some others generate smoother ones ( e.g. , svo , cbsal ) . 
 aws and hounips models generate pointy maps to better account for fixation locations . 
 in this work , we showed that : 1 ) explicit human saliency judgments agree with free - viewing fixations ( thus extending our previous results in  @xcite ) , 2 ) our new benchmark datasets challenge existing state - of - the - art salient object detection models ( in alignment with li  _ et al . 
 _ s dataset  @xcite ) , and 3 ) a conceptually simple and computationally efficient model ( @xmath00.2 s for @xmath34 saliency and segmentation maps on a pc with a 3.2 ghz intel i7 cpu and 6 gb ram using matlab ) wins over the state of the art models and can be used as a baseline in the future . 
 we also highlighted a limitation of models which is the main reason behind their failure on complex scenes . 
 they often segment the wrong object as the most salient one . 
 previous modeling effort has been mainly concentrated on biased datasets with images containing objects at the center . here , we focused on this shortcoming and described how unbiased salient object detection datasets can be constructed . 
 we also reviewed datasets that can be used for saliency model evaluation ( in addition to datasets in table  [ tab : db ] ) and measured their statistics . 
 no dataset exists so far that has all of object annotations , eye movements , and explicit saliency judgments . 
 bruce - a has fixations , and only explicit saliency judgments but not all object labels . 
 judd - a , osie , and pascal - s datasets have annotations and fixations but not explicit saliency judgments . here , we chose the object that falls at the peak of the fixation map as the most salient one . 
 ucsb dataset lacks object annotations but it has fixations and saliency judgments using clicks ( as opposed to object boundaries in bruce - a ) . future research by collecting all information on a large scale dataset will benefit salient object detection research . 
 here we suggested that the most salient object in a scene is the one that attracts the majority of fixations ( similar to  @xcite ) . 
 one can argue that the most salient object is the one that observers look at first . while in general , these two definitions may choose different objects , given the short presentation times in our datasets ( 3 sec on judd , 4 sec on bruce ) we suspect that both suggestions will yield to similar results . 
 our model separates detection from segmentation . 
 a benefit of this way of modeling is that it can be utilized for other purposes ( e.g. , segmenting interesting or important objects ) by replacing the first component of our model . 
 further , augmented with a top - down fixation selection strategy , our model can be used as an active observer ( e.g. ,  @xcite ) . 
 our analysis suggests two main reasons for model performance drop over the judd - a dataset : the _ first reason _ that the literature has focused so far is to avoid incorrectly segmenting the object region ( i.e. , increasing true positives and reducing false positives ) . 
 therefore , low performance is partially due to inaccurately highlighting ( segmenting ) the salient object . 
 the _ second reason _ that we attempted to highlight in this paper ( we believe is the main problem causing performance drop as models performed poorly on judd - a compared to msra-5k ) is segmenting the wrong object ( i.e. , not the most salient object ) . 
 note that although here we did not consider the latest proposed salient object detection models in our model comparison ( e.g. ,  @xcite ) , we believe that our results are likely to generalize compared to newer models . 
 the rationale is that even recent models have also used the asd dataset  @xcite ( which is highly center - biased ) for model development and testing . 
 nontheless , we encourage future works to use our model ( as well as li et al.s model ) as a baseline for model benchmarking .    two types of cues can be utilized for segmenting an object : appearance  @xcite ( i.e. , grouping contiguous areas based on surface similarities ) and boundary  @xcite ( i.e. , cut regions based on observed pixel boundaries ) . 
 here we mainly focused on the appearance features . 
 taking advantage of both region appearance and contour information ( similar to  @xcite ) for saliency detection ( e.g. , growing the foreground salient region until reaching the object boundary ) is an interesting future direction . in this regard 
 , it will be helpful to design suitable measures for evaluating accuracy of models for detecting boundary ( e.g. ,  @xcite ) . 
 our datasets allow more elaborate analysis of the interplay between saliency detection , fixation prediction , and object proposal generation . obviously , these models depend on the other . on one hand , 
 it is critical to correctly predict where people look to know which object is the most salient one . on the other hand , labeled objects in scenes can help us study how objects guide attention and eye movements . 
 for example , by verifying the hypotheses that some parts of objects ( e.g. , object center  @xcite ) or semantically similar objects  @xcite ) attract fixations more , better fixation prediction models become feasible .

 while the notion of most salient object is sensible when multiple objects exist in a scene , current datasets for evaluation of saliency detection approaches often have scenes with only one single object . 
 we introduce three main contributions in this paper : first , we take an in - depth look at the problem of salient object detection by studying the relationship between where people look in scenes and what they choose as the most salient object when they are explicitly asked . 
 based on the agreement between fixations and saliency judgments , we then suggest that the most salient object is the one that attracts the highest fraction of fixations . 
 second , we provide two new less biased benchmark datasets containing scenes with multiple objects that challenge existing saliency models . 
 indeed , we observed a severe drop in performance of 8 state - of - the - art models on our datasets ( 40% to 70% ) . 
 third , we propose a very simple yet powerful model based on superpixels to be used as a baseline for model evaluation and comparison . 
 while on par with the best models on msra-5k dataset , our model wins over other models on our data highlighting a serious drawback of existing models , which is convoluting the processes of locating the most salient object and its segmentation . 
 we also provide a review and statistical analysis of some labeled scene datasets that can be used for evaluating salient object detection models . 
 we believe that our work can greatly help remedy the over - fitting of models to existing biased datasets and opens new venues for future research in this fast - evolving field .

"our aim in physics is not only to calculate some observable and get a correct number but mainly to understand a physical picture responsible for the given phenomenon . 
 it very often happens that a theory formulated in terms of fundamental degrees of freedom can not answer such a question since it becomes overcomplicated at the related scale . 
 thus a main task in this case is to select those degrees of freedom which are indeed essential . 
 for instance , the fundamental degrees of freedom in crystals are ions in the lattice , electrons and the electromagnetic field . nevertheless , in order to understand electric conductivity , heat capacity , etc . 
 we instead work with `` heavy electrons '' with dynamical mass , phonons and their interaction . in this case 
 a complicated electromagnetic interaction of the electrons with the ions in the lattice is `` hidden '' in the dynamical mass of the electron and the interactions among ions in the lattice are eventually responsible for the collective excitations of the lattice - phonons , which are goldstone bosons of the spontaneously broken translational invariance in the lattice of ions . as a result , 
 the theory becomes rather simple - only the electron and phonon degrees of freedom and their interactions are essential for all the properties of crystals mentioned above . 
 quite a similar situation takes place in qcd . 
 one hopes that sooner or later one can solve the full nonquenched qcd on the lattice and get the correct nucleon and pion mass in terms of underlying degrees of freedom : current quarks and gluon fields . 
 however , qcd at the scale of 1 gev becomes too complicated , and hence it is rather difficult to say in this case what kind of physics , inherent in qcd , is relevant to the nucleon mass and its low - energy properties . in this lecture 
 i will try to answer this question . 
 i will show that it is the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry which is the most important qcd phenomenon in this case , and that beyond the scale of spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry light and strange baryons can be viewed as systems of three constituent quarks which interact by the exchange of goldstone bosons ( pseudoscaler mesons ) , vector and scalar mesons ( which could be considered as a representation of a correlated goldstone boson exchange ) and are subject to confinement . 
 at low temperatures and densities the @xmath6 chiral symmetry of qcd lagrangian is spontaneously broken down to @xmath7 by the qcd vacuum ( in the large @xmath8 limit it would be @xmath9 ) . 
 a direct evidence for the spontaneously broken chiral symmetry is a nonzero value of the quark condensates for the light flavors @xmath10 which represent the order parameter . that this is indeed so , we know from three sources : current algebra , qcd sum rules , and lattice gauge calculations . 
 there are two important generic consequences of the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry ( sbcs ) . 
 the first one is an appearance of the octet of pseudoscalar mesons of low mass , @xmath11 , which represent the associated approximate goldstone bosons ( in the large @xmath8 limit the flavor singlet state @xmath12 should be added ) . 
 the second one is that valence ( practically massless ) quarks acquire a dynamical mass , which have been called historically constituent quarks . 
 indeed , the nonzero value of the quark condensate itself implies at the formal level that there should be rather big dynamical mass , which could be in general a moment - dependent quantity . 
 thus the constituent quarks should be considered as quasiparticles whose dynamical mass comes from the nonperturbative gluon and quark - antiquark dressing . 
 the flavor - octet axial current conservation in the chiral limit tells that the constituent quarks and goldstone bosons should be coupled with the strength @xmath13 @xcite , which is a quark analog of the famous goldberger - treiman relation . 
 we can not say at the moment for sure what is the microscopical mechanism for sbcs in qcd . 
 any sufficiently strong scalar interaction between quarks will induce the sbcs ( e.g. the instanton - induced interaction contains the scalar part , or it can be generated by monopole condensation , etc . ) . 
 all these general aspects of sbcs are well illustrated by the nambu and jona - lasinio model @xcite , where the constituent mass is generated by the scalar part of some nonperturbative local gluonic interaction between current quarks while its pseudoscalar part gives rise to a relativistic deeply - bound pseudoscalar @xmath14 systems as goldstone bosons . 
 accordingly one arrives at the following interpretation of light and strange baryons in the low - energy regime . 
 the highly nonperturbative gluodynamics gives rise to correlated quark - antiquark structures in the baryon sea ( virtual mesons ) . at the same time the current valence quarks get dressed by the quark condensates and by the meson loops . 
 the strongly - correlated quark - antiquark pairs in the pseudoscalar channel manifest themselves by virtual pseudoscalar mesons , while the weakly - correlated pairs in other channels - by vector , etc mesons . 
 when one integrates over the meson fields in the baryon wave function one arrives at the simple qqq fock component with confined constituent quarks and with residual interaction between them mediated by the corresponding meson fields @xcite . 
 the complimentary description of the vector - meson fields as well as of the scalar ones as arising from the correlated goldstone bosons is also possible , which does not contradict , however , to their interpretation as weakly bound @xmath14 systems . 
 the coupling of the constituent quarks and the pseudoscalar goldstone bosons will ( in the @xmath15 symmetric approximation ) have the form @xmath16 within the nonlinear realization of chiral symmetry ( it would be @xmath17 within the linear @xmath18-model chiral symmetry representation ) . 
 a coupling of this form , in a nonrelativistic reduction for the constituent quark spinors , will  to lowest order  give rise the @xmath19 structure of the meson - quark vertex , where @xmath20 is meson momentum . 
 thus , the structure of the potential between quarks `` @xmath21 '' and `` @xmath22 '' in momentum representation is    @xmath23    where @xmath24 is dressed green function for chiral field which includes both nonlinear terms of chiral lagrangian and fermion loops , @xmath25 is meson - quark formfactor which takes into account the internal structure of quasiparticles . at big distances ( @xmath26 ) , one has @xmath27 and @xmath28 . 
 it then follows from ( [ 2 ] ) that @xmath29 , which means that the volume integral of the goldstone boson exchange ( gbe ) interaction should vanish ,    @xmath30    this sum rule is not valid in the chiral limit , however , where @xmath31 and , hence , @xmath32 . 
 the sum rule ( [ 1 ] ) is trivial for the tensor component of the pseudoscalar - exchange interaction since the tensor force component automatically vanishes on averaging over the directions of @xmath33 . 
 but for the spin - spin component the sum rule ( [ 1 ] ) indicates that there must be a strong short - range term . 
 indeed , at big interquark separations the spin - spin component of the pseudoscalar - exchange interaction is @xmath34 , it then follows from the sum rule above that at short interquark separations the spin - spin interaction should be opposite in sign as compared to the yukawa tail and very strong :    @xmath35    _ it is this short - range part of the goldstone boson exchange ( gbe ) interaction between the constituent quarks that is of crucial importance for baryons : it has a sign appropriate to reproduce the level splittings and dominates over the yukawa tail towards short distances . 
 _ in a oversimplified consideration with a free klein - gordon green function instead of the dressed one in ( [ 2 ] ) and with @xmath36 , one obtains the following spin - spin component of @xmath37 interaction :    @xmath38    in the chiral limit only the negative short - range part of the gbe interaction survives . 
 as a representation of a multiple correlated goldstone - boson - exchange one can include the exchange by a scalar flavor - singlet `` @xmath18''-meson as well as by vector mesons . 
 the `` @xmath18''-meson exchange does not play a principal role in baryons since it does not contain the spin - spin and tensor - force component . 
 its attractive central potential as well as a weak spin - orbit force can be effectively included into confining interaction in baryons . however , these forces are of significant importance in nn system at medium range . 
 the coupling of constituent quarks with the octet vector meson field @xmath39 in the @xmath40 - symmetric approximation is    @xmath41    where @xmath42 and @xmath43 are the vector- and tensor coupling constants . a coupling of this form - to lowest order - will give rise the spin - spin , tensor , spin - orbit , and central interactions between the constituent quarks . 
 it is very instructive to compare signs of the spin - spin and tensor components of pseudoscalar- and vector - exchange interactions . 
 the spin - spin and tensor components of the pseudoscalar - exchange interaction arise from the @xmath44 structure of the pseudoscalar - meson  constituent quark vertex as :    @xmath45 . \label{3.2}\ ] ]    the coupling of the vector - meson to constituent quark gives @xmath46 structure of the vertex . 
 therefore the spin - spin and tensor components of the vector - meson exchange interaction arise as    @xmath47 . \label{3.3}\ ] ]    comparing ( [ 3.2 ] ) with ( [ 3.3 ] ) one observes that the spin - spin component of the vector - exchange has the same sign as the spin - spin component of the pseudoscalar - exchange interaction and is `` two times stronger '' while their tensor components have opposite signs .    the @xmath46 structure of the vector - meson  constituent quark vertex also suggests that the spin - spin component of the vector - meson - exchange interaction should satisfy the same sum rule ( [ 1 ] ) as the pseudoscalar - exchange interaction . 
 then similar to pseudoscalar - exchange interaction there should be a short - range term in the vector - meson exchange interaction of the form ( [ 1.1 ] ) . 
 again , if one neglects the spatial structure of the meson - quark vertex and uses a free green function for the vector - meson field , this short range term is described by a @xmath48 - function piece similar to equation ( [ 3 ] ) . 
 summarizing , both vector- and pseudoscalar - exchange interactions produce the short - range spin - flavor force ( [ 1.1 ] ) while their tensor forces largely cancel each other in baryons . 
 this observation is crucial for the present model . 
 + the spin - orbit component associated with the vector - meson exchange interaction is big and empirically very important in nn system . 
 so the question is why this spin - orbit force is big in nn system and becomes inessential in baryons , where the spin - orbit splittings are generally very small ( see e.g. at @xmath49 , @xmath50 , ... ls multiplets ) . 
 the reason for this remarkable phenomenon is an explicit flavor dependence of the vector - meson - exchange ls force . 
 consider for simplicity the @xmath51 case , i.e. an exchange by @xmath2- and @xmath3-mesons between u and d quarks . 
 the @xmath2-meson is isovector and the @xmath2-meson exchange potential contains the factor @xmath52 . 
 the @xmath3-meson is isoscalar and the @xmath3-exchange interaction does not contain the isospin - dependent factor . in @xmath53 
 nn partial wave the isospin of the two - nucleon system is @xmath54 and the isospin matrix element for the @xmath2-meson exchange potential is @xmath55 . thus both @xmath3- and @xmath2-meson exchange spin - orbit forces contribute with the same sign in nn system . numerically the contribution from @xmath3-exchange is 2.5 - 3 times bigger than from the @xmath2-meson exchange spin - orbit force . 
 now let us consider @xmath53 state of two light quarks in baryon . 
 in the present case the isospin of the quark pair is @xmath56 , due to the presence of the color part of wave function . 
 then for the @xmath2-meson exchange one obtains @xmath57 . 
 thus the @xmath2-meson exchange spin - orbit force obtains opposite sign and becomes strongly enhanced in baryons . as a result one observes a strong cancellation of the @xmath2- and @xmath3-meson exchange spin - orbit forces in baryons and the net weak spin - orbit interaction does not induce appreciable splittings in baryons . 
 numerical details about both the tensor- and spin - orbit force cancellation in baryons can be found in ref . 
 summarizing previous sections one concludes that the pseudoscalar- and vector - meson exchange interactions produce strong flavor - spin interaction ( [ 1.1 ] ) at short range while the net tensor and spin - orbit forces are rather weak . 
 that the net spin - orbit and tensor interactions between constituent quarks _ in baryons _ should be weak also follows from the typically small splittings in ls - multiplets , which are of the order 10 - 30 mev . 
 these small splittings should be compared with the hyperfine splittings produced by spin - spin force , which are of the order of @xmath58 splitting . 
 thus , indeed , in baryons it is the spin - spin interaction ( [ 1.1 ] ) between constituent quarks is of crucial importance . 
 consider first , for the purposes of illustration , a schematic model which neglects the radial dependence of the potential function @xmath59 in ( [ 1.1 ] ) , and assume a harmonic confinement among quarks as well as @xmath60 . in this model 
 @xmath61    note , that contrary to the color - magnetic interaction from perturbative one - gluon exchange , the chiral interaction is explicitly flavor - dependent . 
 it is this circumstance which allows to solve the long - standing problem of ordering of the lowest positive - negative parity states . 
 if the only interaction between the quarks were the flavor- and spin - independent harmonic confining interaction , the baryon spectrum would be organized in multiplets of the symmetry group @xmath62 . in this case 
 the baryon masses would be determined solely by the orbital structure , and the spectrum would be organized in an _ alternative sequence of positive and negative parity states , _ i.e. in this case the spectrum would be : ground state of positive parity ( @xmath63 shell , @xmath64 is the number of harmonic oscillator excitations in a 3-quark state ) , first excited band of negative parity ( @xmath65 ) , second excited band of positive parity ( @xmath66 ) , etc .    the hamiltonian ( [ 4 ] ) , within a first order perturbation theory , reduces the @xmath62 symmetry down to @xmath67 , which automatically implies a splitting between the octet and decuplet baryons ( e.g. the @xmath68 resonance becomes heavier than nucleon ) . 
 let us now see how the pure confinement spectrum above becomes modified when the gbe hamiltonian ( [ 4 ] ) is switched on . for the octet states 
 @xmath69 , @xmath70 , @xmath71 , @xmath72 ( @xmath63 shell ) as well as for their first radial excitations of positive parity @xmath73 , @xmath74 , @xmath75 , @xmath76 ( @xmath66 shell ) the expectation value of the hamiltonian ( [ 4 ] ) is @xmath77 . 
 for the decuplet states @xmath68 , @xmath78 , @xmath79 , @xmath80 ( @xmath63 shell ) the corresponding matrix element is @xmath81 . in the negative parity excitations ( @xmath65 shell ) in the @xmath69 , @xmath70 and @xmath71 spectra ( @xmath82 - @xmath83 , @xmath84 - @xmath85 and @xmath86 - @xmath87 ) the contribution of the interaction ( [ 4 ] ) is @xmath88 . the first negative parity excitation in the @xmath70 spectrum ( @xmath65 shell ) @xmath89 - @xmath90 is flavor singlet and , in this case , the corresponding matrix element is @xmath91 . 
 the latter state is unique and is absent in other spectra due to its flavor - singlet nature . 
 these matrix elements alone suffice to prove that the ordering of the lowest positive and negative parity states in the baryon spectrum will be correctly predicted by the chiral boson exchange interaction ( [ 4 ] ) . 
 the constant @xmath92 may be determined from the n@xmath93 splitting to be 29.3 mev . 
 the oscillator parameter @xmath94 , which characterizes the effective confining interaction , may be determined as one half of the mass differences between the first excited @xmath95 states and the ground states of the baryons , which have the same flavor - spin , flavor and spin symmetries ( e.g. @xmath73 - @xmath69 , @xmath74 - @xmath70 , @xmath75 - @xmath71 ) , to be @xmath96 mev . 
 thus the two free parameters of this simple model are fixed and we can make now predictions .    in the @xmath69 , @xmath70 and @xmath71 sectors the mass difference between the lowest excited @xmath97 states ( @xmath73 , @xmath74 , and @xmath75 ) and @xmath98 negative parity pairs ( @xmath82 - @xmath83 , @xmath84 - @xmath85 , and @xmath86 - @xmath87 , respectively ) will then be @xmath99 whereas for the lowest states in the @xmath70 system ( @xmath74 , @xmath89 - @xmath90 ) it should be    @xmath100    this simple example shows how the chiral interaction provides different ordering of the lowest positive and negative parity excited states in the spectra of the nucleon and the @xmath70-hyperon . 
 this is a direct consequence of the symmetry properties of the boson - exchange interaction @xcite . 
 namely , completely symmetric fs state in the @xmath73 , @xmath74 and @xmath75 positive parity resonances from the @xmath66 band feels a much stronger attractive interaction than the mixed symmetry state in the @xmath82 - @xmath83 , @xmath84 - @xmath85 and @xmath86 -@xmath87 resonances of negative parity ( @xmath65 shell ) . 
 consequently the masses of the positive parity states @xmath73 , @xmath74 and @xmath75 are shifted down relative to the other ones , which explains the reversal of the otherwise expected `` normal ordering '' . 
 the situation is different for @xmath89 - @xmath90 and @xmath74 , as the flavor state of @xmath89 - @xmath90 is totally antisymmetric . because of 
 this the @xmath89 - @xmath90 gains an attractive energy , which is comparable to that of the @xmath74 , and thus the ordering suggested by the confining oscillator interaction is maintained . 
 note that the problem of the relative position of positive - negative parity states can not be solved with other types of hyperfine interactions between constituent quarks ( the colour - magnetic and instanton - induced ones ) . 
 in the semirelativistic chiral constituent quark model @xcite the dynamical part of the hamiltonian consists of linear pairwise confining interaction with the string tension fixed to the known value 1 gev / fm from regge slopes ( which also follows from the heavy quarkonium spectroscopy and lattice calculations ) , and the chiral interaction , mediated by pseudoscalar , scalar and vector - meson exchanges . both the flavor - octet and flavor - singlet pseudoscalar- and 
 vector - meson exchanges are taken into account . 
 the coupling constants of constituent quarks with mesons are fixed from the empirically known @xmath101 , @xmath102 , and @xmath103 coupling constants . 
 the `` sigma - meson ''  constituent quark coupling constant is taken to be equal the pion 
 constituent quark coupling constant , as constrained by chiral symmetry . for the constituent quark 
 masses one takes typical values @xmath104 mev , @xmath105 mev and do not fit them . 
 the short - range behaviour of the interaction is determined by the cut - off parameters @xmath70 in the constituent quark  meson form - factors , which are taken in monopole form . in order to avoid a proliferation of free parameters , by assuming independent values of @xmath70 for each meson , we adopt the linear scaling prescription @xmath106 , where @xmath107 is meson mass , for pseudoscalar- and vector mesons .    the kinetic - energy operator is taken in relativistic form , @xmath108 . 
 the semirelativistic three - quark hamiltonian was solved along the stochastical variational method @xcite in momentum space . for the whole q - q potential the model involves a total of 4 free parameters whose numerical values 
 are determined from the fit to all 35 confirmed low - lying states .    in fig . 
 1 we present the ground states as well as low - lying excited states in @xmath64 , @xmath68 , @xmath70 , @xmath71 , @xmath72 , and @xmath80 spectra . from the results of fig . 
 1 it becomes evident that within the chiral constituent quark model a unified description of both nonstrange and strange baryon spectra is achieved in good agreement with phenomenology . 
 it is instructive to learn how the spin - spin interaction ( [ 1.1 ] ) affects the energy levels when it is switched on and its strength is gradually increased ( fig . 
 2 ) . starting out from the case with confinement only , one observes that the degeneracy of states is removed and the inversion of ordering of positive and negative parity states is achieved in the @xmath64 spectrum , as well as for some states in the @xmath70 spectrum , while the ordering of the lowest positive - negative parity states is opposite in @xmath64 and @xmath70 spectra . 
 it is clear that the fock components @xmath109 ( including meson continuum ) can not be completely integrated out in favour of the meson - exchange @xmath37 potentials for some states above or near the corresponding meson thresholds . 
 such components in addition to the main one @xmath110 could explain e.g. an exceptionally big splitting of the flavor singlet states @xmath111 , since the @xmath89 lies below the @xmath112 threshold and can be presented as @xmath112 bound system @xcite . 
 note , that in the case of the present approach this old idea is completely natural and does not contradict a flavor - singlet @xmath110 nature of @xmath89 , while it would be in conflict with naive constituent quark model where no room for mesons in baryons . 
 an admixture of such components will be important in order to understand strong decays of some excited states . 
 while technically inclusion of such components in addition to the main one @xmath110 in a coupled - channel approach is rather difficult task , it should be considered as one of the most important future directions . 
 what is an intuitive picture of the nucleon in the low - energy regime ? 
 the goldstone bosons as well as vector meson fields couple to valence quarks . 
 thus the nucleon consists mostly of 3 constituent quarks which are very big objects due to their meson clouds ( see fig . 
 3 ) . these constituent quarks are all the time in strong overlap inside the nucleon . 
 that is why the short - range part of chiral interaction ( which is represented by the contact term in the oversimplified representation ) is so crucially important inside baryons . 
 when constituent quarks are well separated and there is a phase space for meson propagation , the long - range yukawa tails of meson - exchange interactions become very important . 
 it is these parts of meson exchange which produce the necessary long- and intermediate - range attraction in two - nucleon system . 
 if one ascribes a short - range central repulsion in the nn system to the central part of @xmath3 exchange between nucleons , then one should increase the @xmath103 coupling constant by factor 3 as compared to its empirical value , as it is usually done in phenomenological one - boson - exchange nn potentials . 
 evidently the short - range repulsion in the nn system should be connected with the nucleon structure in the low - energy regime and within the quark picture should be related to fermi - nature of constituent quarks and to the specific interactions between them . 
 so far , all studies of the short - range @xmath4 interaction within the constituent quark model were based on the one - gluon exchange interaction between quarks . 
 they explained the short - range repulsion in the @xmath4 system as due to the colour - magnetic part of oge combined with quark interchanges between 3q clusters @xcite . 
 it has been shown , however , that there is practically no room for colour - magnetic interaction in light baryon spectroscopy and any appreciable amount of colour - magnetic interaction , in addition to chiral interaction , destroys the spectrum @xcite . 
 this conclusion is confirmed by recent lattice qcd calculations @xcite . 
 if so , the question arises which interquark interaction is responsible for the short - range @xmath4 repulsion . 
 below i show that the same short - range part of chiral interaction ( [ 1.1 ] ) which causes e.g. @xmath113 splitting and produces good baryon spectra , also induces a short - range repulsion in @xmath4 system when the latter is treated as 6q system @xcite .    at present 
 one can use only a simple nonrelativistic @xmath114 ansatz for the nucleon wave function when one applies the quark model to @xmath4 interaction . 
 thus one needs first an effective nonrelativistic parametrization of chiral interaction interaction which would provide correct nucleon mass , @xmath113 splitting and the nucleon stability with this ansatz . for that one can use the nonrelativistic parametrization @xcite which satisfies approximately the conditions above .        where @xmath116 is a collective ( generator ) 
 coordinate which is the separation distance between the two wells ( it should not be mixed with the relative motion jacobi coordinate ) , @xmath117 is the lowest expectation value of the 6q hamiltonian at fixed @xmath116 , and @xmath118 is a mass of two well - separated nucleons ( @xmath119 ) calculated with the same hamiltonian .    at the moment we are interested in what is the @xmath4 interaction at zero separation between nucleons . 
 it has been proved by harvey that when @xmath120 , then in both @xmath121 and @xmath122 partial waves in the @xmath4 system only two types of orbital 6q configurations survive @xcite : @xmath123_o>$ ] and @xmath124_o>$ ] , where @xmath125_o$ ] is young diagram , describing spatial permutational symmetry in 6q system . 
 there are a few different flavor - spin symmetries , compatible with the spatial symmetries above : @xmath126_o[33]_{fs}$ ] , @xmath127_o[33]_{fs}$ ] , @xmath127_o[51]_{fs}$ ] , @xmath127_o[411]_{fs}$ ] , @xmath127_o[321]_{fs}$ ] , and @xmath127_o[2211]_{fs}$ ] . 
 thus , in order to evaluate the @xmath4 interaction at zero separation between nucleons it is necessary to diagonalize a @xmath5 hamiltonian in the basis above and use the procedure ( [ 6 ] ) .    from the adiabatic born - oppenheimer approximation ( [ 6 ] ) we find that @xmath128 is highly repulsive in both @xmath121 and @xmath122 partial waves , with the core being of order 1 gev . 
 this repulsion implies a strong suppression of the @xmath4 wave function in the nucleon overlap region .    due to the specific flavor - spin symmetry of chiral interaction between 
 quarks the configuration @xmath129_o[51]_{fs}$ ] becomes highly dominant among other possible 6q configurations at zero separation between nucleons ( however , the `` energy '' of this configuration is much higher than the energy of two well - separated nucleons , that is why there is a strong short - range repulsion in @xmath4 system ) . 
 the symmetry structure of this dominant configuration induces `` an additional '' effective repulsion , related to the `` pauli forbidden state '' in this case , and the s - wave @xmath4 relative motion wave function has a node at short range@xcite . 
 the existence of a strong repulsion , related to the energy ballance , discussed above , suggests , however , that the amplitude of the oscillating @xmath4 wave function at short range will be strongly suppressed . 
 thus , within the chiral constituent quark model one has all the necessary ingredients to understand microscopically the @xmath4 interaction . 
 there appears strong short - range repulsion from the same short - range part of chiral interaction which also produces hyperfine splittings in baryon spectroscopy . 
 the long- and intermediate - range attraction in the @xmath4 system is automatically implied by the yukawa part of pion - exchange and correlated two - pion exchanges ( @xmath18-exchange ) between quarks belonging to different nucleons . 
 the necessary tensor and spin - orbit force comes from the pseudoscalar- and vector - exchange yukawa tails . 
 what will be a short - range interaction in other @xmath130 and @xmath131 systems ? in the chiral limit there is no difference between all octet baryons : @xmath132 . 
 thus if one explains a strong short - range repulsion in @xmath4 system as related mostly to the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry , as above , then the same short - range repulsion should persist in other @xmath130 and @xmath131 systems @xcite . 
 of course , due to the explicit chiral symmetry breaking the strength of this repulsion should be essentially different as compared to that one in @xmath4 system . 
 one can naively expect that it will be weaker .

 the flavor - spin structure and sign of the short - range part of the spin - spin force reduces the @xmath0 symmetry down to @xmath1 , induces hyperfine splittings and provides correct ordering of the lowest states with positive and negative parity . 
 there is a cancellation of the tensor force from pseudoscalar- and vector - exchanges in baryons . 
 the spin - orbit interactions from @xmath2-like and @xmath3-like exchanges also cancel each other in baryons while they produce a big spin - orbit force in nn system . 
 a unified description of light and strange baryon spectra calculated in a semirelativistic framework is presented . 
 it is demonstrated that the same short - range part of spin - spin interaction between the constituent quarks induces a strong short - range repulsion in @xmath4 system when the latter is treated as @xmath5 system . 
 thus one can achieve a simultaneous understanding of a baryon structure and baryon - baryon interaction in the low - energy regime .
