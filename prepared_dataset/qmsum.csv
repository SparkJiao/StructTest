"What did Kirsty Williams AM say about her plan for quality assurance?
Lynne Neagle AM: Good morning, everyone. Welcome to the Children, Young People and Education Committee. We've received apologies for absence from Suzy Davies and there is no substitute. Janet Finch-Saunders is joining us from the Assembly offices in Colwyn Bay via video conference. Can I ask Members if there are any declarations of interest, please? No. Okay. Item 2, then, this morning is a post-legislative scrutiny session on the Higher Education (Wales) Act 2015. I'm very pleased to welcome Kirsty Williams AM, Minister for Education, and Huw Morris, who is director of the skills, higher education and lifelong learning group in Welsh Government. Thank you, both, for attending, and thank you for the paper that you provided in advance. I will just start the questioning by asking whether you are planning to repeal the 2015 higher education Act, or will it be amended by the post-compulsory education and training Bill?
Kirsty Williams AM: Thank you very much, Chair. I'm very pleased to be with the committee again this morning, although it's in slightly unusual circumstances. As a piece of post-legislative scrutiny, this was a Bill that was taken forward by a different Minister in a different administration, but I think it is really valuable work in the context of the question you just set out: what can we learn from the implementation of this piece of legislation as we move forward with our reform journey and with this Government and my proposals to introduce a new commission for tertiary education? There is much, at the moment, that lies within the 2015 Act that we will look to bring forward into the new legislation, but there are certainly experiences--and I'm sure we'll come on to some of the evidence that has been received about what's worked, what perhaps hasn't worked--that we all want to reflect on and be mindful of as we take forward the new Bill, including the report of this committee as part of it. So, it is our intention that this Bill will be superceded by the new PCETR Bill.
Lynne Neagle AM: Okay, thank you. We've got a series of questions now from Sian Gwenllian.
Sian Gwenllian AM: Good morning. Do you believe that the Act has fulfilled all the Government's objectives? Where are the weaknesses?
Kirsty Williams AM: Diolch yn fawr, Sian. As I've said, it's a bit difficult to place myself in the mind of the previous Minister when this legislation was first envisaged and then taken through. You'll be aware that there were four main reasons for the introduction of the Bill: around regulation of institutions in Wales; safeguarding the contribution made to public good arising from Welsh Government's financial support for the sector; maintaining a focus on fair access; and preserving and protecting the principle of institutional autonomy. I think the evidence that has been received by the committee to date shows that there are different views about the effectiveness of whether all four strategic aims have been achieved. I think those strategic aims are still really, really important and certainly will underpin our thought process going forward, but we have to recognise the higher education and research Bill across the border in England, the implementation of new student support measures in Wales, as well as the report that was done by Ellen Hazelkorn, I think, means it is appropriate that we move forward with different proposals, not just regulation of the HE sector but the post-compulsory sector as a whole. We will look to see what we can do to strengthen or whether there is more that we need to do to achieve those four objectives, because I think those four objectives are still very, very relevant. But we have to have legislation now that is fit for the circumstances we currently find ourselves in and, hopefully, futureproofs us for how we want to see the sector develop in the future.
Sian Gwenllian AM: Do you feel perhaps that the legislation itself hasn't been strong enough, and that you then have had to drive some of these objectives through the annual remit letter, rather than through legislation, and that's why the strengthening is required?
Kirsty Williams AM: Certainly, I see the remit letter as a really, really important way in which national priorities and the priorities of an elected Government can be clearly stated, communicated to the Higher Education Funding Council for Wales, and then HEFCW use their powers to ensure that that happens. So, certainly, I see the remit letter as being a very important mechanism for ensuring, as I said, that those national priorities are clearly articulated, and then change happens.
Sian Gwenllian AM: Has the current legislation been framed around institutional autonomy so that it's not possible for institutions to fulfil any national outcomes, and is that going to be an element of the new Bill?
Kirsty Williams AM: Well, certainly, the 2015 Act contains numerous provisions that protect universities'privileges and autonomy. And that's really important, and those are principles that I am committed to in any legislation that I bring forward. We'll certainly be looking to see how we can carry those protections into the forthcoming Bill, but, at the same time, we do have to ensure appropriate regulation and accountability of institutions for their public funding and the privileges that they enjoy. And I think there are a number of ways in which that can happen. We have a very positive working relationship with the Higher Education Funding Council for Wales, and I am very fortunate to have a very positive working relationship with the sector. The remit letters are a really important way in which we can lay out those national priorities. I don't think there's anything in the legislation per se that prevents those national priorities being articulated and being acted upon.
Sian Gwenllian AM: I don't think that's what HEFCW has said in their evidence. They've said that the Bill has been framed in a way where it's not possible for institutions to fulfil any requirements. You're talking about the remit letter; maybe you need to have that discussion there, but, in terms of the Bill itself, you can't make them fulfil any national outcomes. Shouldn't there be a discussion looking to move in a direction where there are national outcomes being set through legislation, because there is public money going into that?
Kirsty Williams AM: Well, I don't know whether we need national outcomes through legislation, because those national priorities, potentially, will change over time. What is really important, and what we will be seeking to do in the new legislation, is look to move to a system of outcome agreements. So, there is a very clear expectation that the commission will have, in regulating the sector, and co-ordinating and funding the sector, to create a system of outcome agreements, where those outputs will reflect national priorities, and that's one of the things that we've consulted on, and will look to take forward in the new legislation.
Sian Gwenllian AM: Okay. That's clear enough. What about private providers? The Act, or the Act as it stands, makes it a requirement for a regulated institution to be a charity, and that means it's not possible to regulate alternative private providers under the Act, even though they can provide higher education in Wales. What is your view on this, and will the new legislation continue with the requirement of being a charity?
Kirsty Williams AM: Okay. So, I think, first of all, it's important to make the distinction between the scale of private providers, and what could be termed as'unregulated providers'in the Welsh system, as opposed to the English system. And I think that's a really important distinction to make. So, currently, under the current legislation, unregulated providers can only access Welsh Government student support if they're designated on a case-by-case basis. So, we do have a circumstance where--and a process in place, to manage this. So, we have a specific designation policy, which is operated on our behalf by HEFCW. Only six organisations were designated on a case-by-case basis in the 2018-19 academic year, so the scale here is small. Three of those were further education colleges. So, when we talk about a private provider, perhaps people would have a view of a private university, but, actually, three of those were FE colleges, which we would all be familiar with. And the three private providers were the Centre for Alternative Technology, the training arm of the Church in Wales and the Newport and District Group Training Association. All three of those are actual charities. So, in order for their courses to be specifically designated, the three crucial questions that those providers have to answer are: quality--is what they're providing to students of a good quality; the financial viability of the institution, again, to try to protect the interests of the students who may find themselves embarking on a course in an institution that isn't viable; as well as their contribution to private--sorry, not to private good--public good. And we are considering how that part of the sector will be regulated in the forthcoming legislation. But, Huw, I don't know if there's anything else to add?
Huw Morris: Well, just to say that there are a very small number of private providers, as the Minister has outlined, and, in comparison with England, where I think the last figures said that there were between 300 and 400 private providers in England, you get a sense of the differences that exist there. And, if you look at what happened over recent years, it has been those small private providers across the UK who have been most financially challenged and a number of them have stopped their operations, with consequences for the students. So, we've been keen to put students at the front of things to make sure that the institutions that they're enrolling with are strong and have good quality.
Sian Gwenllian AM: Okay. So, what you're saying is that you will continue with a charitable status, or not--
Kirsty Williams AM: At this stage--
Sian Gwenllian AM: --or are you still thinking about it?
Kirsty Williams AM: Well, at this stage, I think the charitable status will continue to be an important part of what we will take forward.
Sian Gwenllian AM: Just turning finally to part-time fees and postgraduate fees, do you have an intention to regulate this part in the new legislation?
Kirsty Williams AM: I have to say that, at present, we've not identified an urgent reason to designate these courses as qualifying courses for the purposes of a fee limit. And there are a number of reasons for that. Actually, the current Act--the 2015 Act--does not permit the fee regulation of postgraduate courses, other than PGCE courses for IT purposes. In the case of part-time courses, I'm currently content that fee levels are not exceeding the amount of student support made available by the Welsh Government. So, I think we are, at this moment, relaxed about that, and there are some difficulties around deciding and introducing fee limits on postgraduate courses. I think what's really important to me is the success at the moment of attracting people to postgraduate and part-time study in Wales, as a result of our reforms to student finance. But, clearly, we'll need to keep that under review. But, at this current moment, the Act precludes fee regulation in some areas and there's not a pressing policy need that we've identified to date.
Lynne Neagle AM: Okay. Thank you. Okay, we're going to move on now to some questions about the level of ambition in the higher education Act and any lessons for the PCET Bill, from Janet Finch-Saunders.
Janet Finch-Saunders AM: Thank you. To what extent has the 2012 university funding system limited Welsh Government's policy leverage over the sector, and how has the HE Act addressed this beyond the levers offered by fee and access plans?
Kirsty Williams AM: Of course, the Act was introduced as a direct result of the changing scenario around finance and the different ways in which, because of the reduction in HEFCW's budget, the level of influence that HEFCW would be able to exert over institutions through the imposition of terms and conditions of funding--. So, the Act was introduced in part to address that shift in influence and the Act also has provided HEFCW with a range of new powers of intervention and sanctions in the case of non-compliance by institutions. Personally, I wholeheartedly believe that tertiary education providers should contribute to national goals and outcomes as part of what I'd describe as a civic mission. I'm determined that any legislation that I bring forward and any commission that I establish will be empowered to enable that to happen through its regulatory and funding powers. Of course, the funding situation has shifted again now because of the introduction of what is commonly known as the Diamond reforms, but our new system of student finance does again shift the parameters of influence that HEFCW or any new tertiary commission could have. But, as I said earlier, it's not to say that institutions have had a free reign. We have been able to use the remit letter and our relationship with HEFCW to progress agendas that we would want to see. So, for instance, you'll be aware, in my remit letter, I am concerned about issues around how people working in the sector are paid. We've been able to successfully see all institutions sign up to becoming living wage employers, all institutions sign up to the Welsh Government's code of ethical procurement. So, it's not to say that the Act has meant that we've had no influence, but there are opportunities now, because of the change in financial circumstances once again, to look at that in any forthcoming legislation.
Janet Finch-Saunders AM: Thank you, Minister. Do you share HEFCW's views on the benefits of having national targets to get institutions to address national priorities? Is this something you wish you could do?
Kirsty Williams AM: Well, it's not something I wish I could do; I think that we're doing it. Self-praise is no recommendation, but, because of the working relationship that we have, I think we're seeing some success in using the remit letter to influence national outcomes. So, I've just talked about living wage; we're also using our remit letter to drive transparency over senior leaders'pay, the gender pay gap within institutions. For instance, as part of this Government's commitment to improving mental health, we've been able to use the remit letter and some funding to be able to drive change and some improvements in mental health in the higher education sector. These are national priorities and we're acting upon them and we're using the multiple levers we have at the moment to engage in universities. And, I have to say, universities have risen to that challenge, and I'm very grateful to them for doing that.
Janet Finch-Saunders AM: Thank you. Are there plans to give the proposed new PCET funding body more effective policy levers to align the sector to the social, economic and civic needs of Wales? And, if so, how will this be done?
Kirsty Williams AM: Well, as I said in answer earlier, I'm determined that we ensure a sense of civic mission for the entirety of the sector, including our institutes of higher education. You'll be aware, Janet, that, in the consultation exercises that have been undertaken by the Government so far on PCET reform, we will be introducing more formal outcome agreements, whereby institutions might be given by the commission very clear expectations of how they're expected to contribute to national priorities.
Janet Finch-Saunders AM: Thanks. We've heard that the HE Act, by focusing on individual institutions, did not encourage collaboration, even for widening access activity. Was this a missed opportunity and how will this be taken forward in the PCET Bill?
Kirsty Williams AM: I think we can strengthen our sector by closer collaboration. I think what sets us apart in Wales is that this Government is determined to create a legislative regime and a regulation regime that encourages collaboration and co-operation, which is in stark contrast to the marketisation and the competition that we see being regulated for and legislated for across the border in England. That's one of the reasons why we are going to introduce the new PCET reforms--to create collaboration, not just between different higher education institutes but actually across the sector. So, this is a prime opportunity where we can create a framework that demands and encourages collaboration, not just, as I said, in between individual institutions but across the entirety of the sector. We're doing that because that means we can avoid duplication, we can fill gaps that there currently are and we can create a system that allows for a seamless passage for students to move between the different parts of post-compulsory education that are currently available, where, sometimes, those students find barriers.
Lynne Neagle AM: Okay, Janet?
Janet Finch-Saunders AM: Thank you--that's great, thank you.
Lynne Neagle AM: We've got some questions now around HEFCW's powers of intervention from Dawn Bowden.
Dawn Bowden AM: Thank you, Chair. We received substantial evidence from HEFCW suggesting that powers were inflexible and hard to use--I think HEFCW called them'threatening'--saying that they make sanctions difficult to use and so on. Are you satisfied that HEFCW's powers are useful on a preventative day-to-day basis?
Kirsty Williams AM: If I may disagree slightly, I don't think their powers are frightening. It's very clear what powers are available to HEFCW, and they're certainly more than just the ability to, maybe, lean on an institution. Clearly, there is a system by which there is the ability to, you know, ramp up and escalate levels of intervention in the sector by HEFCW, but I certainly wouldn't describe them as inflexible or not having weight.
Dawn Bowden AM: I think they were saying it was difficult to use for swift interventions--they found it a bit cumbersome. They explained to us that they often take informal measures or actions in their role as regulator, and they've explained that the small size of the sector enables good relationships to be developed. How can such measures work in the tertiary education body when there clearly will be many more than the 10 providers?
Kirsty Williams AM: Well, looking ahead to the new Bill, I would want to see and be very keen to ensure that there are sufficiently flexible--did you use the word soft--and soft regulatory powers that the commission could exercise. Those powers, for instance, could include the ability to offer advice and guidance, rather than, maybe, punitive interventions, and powers to undertake enhanced monitoring of institutions to ensure compliance with regulatory conditions. So, I would expect the commission to be able to have a series of abilities to intervene, from the soft, flexible type, which is non-punitive but actually allows people to go in and support institutions, through to something that would be, as I said, more punitive, if they felt that an institution was in danger of not providing quality or financial failure.
Hefin David AM: Can I just come in there, on the point that was made? The issue that seemed to me to come from HEFCW and from the universities is that the dial seems to have only three steps. So, rather than having a graduated series of actions that they can take, it seems to step from--what did he call it--a'meeting without coffee'to--
Kirsty Williams AM: That's a very HEFCW thing to say.
Hefin David AM: --potentially institutions going bankrupt, and there don't seem to be many steps in between that. I'd invite you to say whether you'd like to remedy that in future.
Kirsty Williams AM: I think, as I said at the beginning of the session, this is why this post-legislative scrutiny is useful, because we can reflect on that feedback. As I said, I would expect to be able to ensure that the commission had a range of powers that could address--from that soft power and those early conversations to being able to, as I said, issue, perhaps, advice and guidance to an institution, so there would be a more graduated escalation. Huw, is there anything else that I've missed out?
Huw Morris: Just to build on what the Minister has said, there's a range of ways in which we interact with all institutions that are going to be in the tertiary sector, and some of that is about providing information. So, HEFCW provides information--it sends around circulars, it produces reports and it holds events. There's staff, management and leadership development activity, which can create a culture amongst the leaders of institutions, but also amongst their governing bodies, to help them move in a particular direction. We would hope that's in the direction of the civic university approach that the Minister has outlined. We use those mechanisms and informal interactions with FE college principals, with the work-based learning provider network, with sixth forms and others, and we would want to see, I hope, in the tertiary sector some alignment of those things. When things go badly wrong, there are a range of mechanisms. I think what stands behind HEFCW's comments is that before we had a loan-based system of student finance, there was a system of block grant allocations and conditions could be attached to those grant allocations by HEFCW. I don't think we're going to be going back to that system in the foreseeable future because of the pressures on public finances--
Hefin David AM: That wasn't how I understood it. I understood it to be the fact that you use these informal powers and then the next step up is quite a severe sanction and there's not much in between those.
Huw Morris: So, in--. Shall I carry on?
Kirsty Williams AM: Of course, yes.
Huw Morris: In the Hazelkorn review, there's quite a lot of focus on that and looking to learn from other national systems where outcome agreements provide a broader measure of the range of things the institutions do and a mechanism for tracking how things are done through the provision of information back to the institution to help them know how they're doing. And potentially, in some of these other institutions, funding is linked to some of those things.
Kirsty Williams AM: And, of course, what always has to be--. What we have to strike the balance of as well is at what point those powers seem to be--and the ability to direct--interfering with the principle of autonomy within an institution. So, there's that balance to be struck, isn't there, about creating a regulatory regime, which I'm very keen and the Act attempted to do, which was to enshrine institutional autonomy, and that's really, really important, but also a regulatory regime, the ability to influence and to develop and to deliver national outcomes and the power to intervene in that sector, which you know, better than probably anybody else in this room, guards that institutional autonomy very, very, very dear indeed. And that's the balance that we need to try and strike as we go forward with the new commission proposals.
Lynne Neagle AM: Okay. Thank you. Dawn.
Dawn Bowden AM: Thank you, Chair. I think, in terms of the levels of measures--and I understand what you're saying--but I think what HEFCW were saying was that they try as far as possible to use informal measures and they are able to do that because of the size of the sector--just 10 institutions to work with. The post-16 sector, however many we're talking--50 plus providers--it's probably going to be less likely that they would be able to have that sort of relationship with the leaders in those institutions. So, the informal measures might not be as prevalent as they are currently, possibly.
Kirsty Williams AM: Yes, but also, what's incumbent upon me as the Minister is to ensure that the commission is set up in a way where it can have that relationship with the sector, because what's really important to remember is that HEFCW will be replaced. We're not asking HEFCW suddenly to go from regulating a small number of institutions to suddenly regulating 50. We'll be creating a commission that will be structured in such a way that it can have those relationships. Because, of course, whilst HEFCW will face changes, our relationship with and how we manage the FE sector and the apprenticeship sector will also shift. So, the point is that we need to create a commission that will still be able to be close to the sector, close enough to be able to provide that soft regulation, those really important relationships in a way--. So, it has to be created in such a way and resourced in such a way that it allows that to happen, and that's my intention.
Dawn Bowden AM: Okay. Well, then, of course, the University of Wales said to us that they felt that there was the potential for HEFCW to issue directions enforceable by injunction to remedy minor matters. So, I think, from what you're saying, you wouldn't be expecting that to happen. Just the fact that they've got the power doesn't necessarily mean that that's what they're going to do.
Kirsty Williams AM: Well, I think it's important to recognise when HEFCW can enforce its directions by way of an injunction. If they were to do that because a university was breaking fee limits or because there were real questions about the quality of the provision or whether a university was not complying with the financial management code--personally, I wouldn't describe those as minor matters, as a Minister, if we had an institution that was significantly falling down on quality and HEFCW were using these powers to intervene. I wouldn't describe that as a minor matter.
Dawn Bowden AM: No. That's fair enough. And, actually, on that point, we've had some recent high-profile issues in Swansea and Trinity St David, and HEFCW still haven't yet used their powers of intervention. Do you find that surprising?
Kirsty Williams AM: I think what they have done in these circumstances is, perhaps, used their ability to support those institutions through what, undoubtedly, have been challenging times. Given the fact that there are ongoing legal processes attached to Swansea University, I think it would not be appropriate for me to comment any further, because there are still matters in train with regard to that institution. But clearly, our expectation on HEFCW is to ensure that they are using their powers to support those universities, and I would expect them, if they felt necessary, to use the full remit of their powers if they felt that that was what they needed to do. Now, I have to trust their professional judgment that that has not been necessary to date, but our expectation is that they would do that if they felt it was necessary.
Dawn Bowden AM: Okay. Thank you. Thank you, Chair.
Lynne Neagle AM: Hefin David has some questions now on fee and access plans.
Hefin David AM: Are you concerned that neither the regulator nor the sector seem to have any confidence in fee and access plans?
Kirsty Williams AM: I think the concept of a fee and access plan is an important concept. Whether we can do them better, whether we can reflect on what's happened to date and create a better system of what's included in a fee and access plan and how those fee and access plans can be monitored, there's an opportunity to do that in forthcoming legislation.
Hefin David AM: So, have you been aware of specific issues yourself? Have they brought them to you?
Kirsty Williams AM: Well, no, not in the sense that they've brought them to me to talk about specifically. From my perspective, fee and access plans are focused very much on inputs, and, really, I'd like to think about outputs and outcomes, more importantly--what are the outcomes of the fee and access plan, not necessarily just how much money has been spent on them. I think, certainly, to really understand the success of the fee and access plan, you have to question whether an annual basis is an appropriate timescale for a university to be working to, and whether we could have something that was focused over a longer period of time. Because, when you think about it, you write the plan and then you're into it, and then, the next thing you know, you're writing your next year's plan. So, I think there's an opportunity there to look to restructure. So, do I see a place for fee and access plans going forward, as part of our outcome agreements? Yes, I do. Can we do them differently to make them more effective? Yes, I think we can.
Hefin David AM: So, why would introducing outcome agreements make them work any better?
Kirsty Williams AM: Well, I think they're going to be a part of an outcome agreement--part of that wider expectation. So, fee and access plans are there to address an issue around, primarily, changing the nature of people who go to university and making sure that nobody is put off from pursuing that. So, that's part of a wider piece of work that I'd want to see as an outcome agreement. But, as I said, I think looking at outcomes for students and outcomes of that activity, rather than the inputs of the activity, over a longer period of time, is probably a more effective way of doing it. I think it's still--. In a way, it's difficult to make a final judgment on whether fee and access plans in their current format have worked, because we need to know what'll happen to those students in the future. But undoubtedly, despite the limitations of them, I do think we're making progress in terms of access, but I don't think we can necessarily point to the fee and access plans as being the driver for some of those improvements.
Hefin David AM: No, I appreciate that, and some of the things you're saying reflect some of the discussions we've had, but what was clear is that the process and bureaucratic nature of the way you present fee and access plans doesn't work, particularly given the fact that, four years on, early fee and access plans are still being evaluated. There's a real problem there. So, what you're saying--can I just pin down what you're saying--is that we may be moving away from yearly fee and access plans to something that's longer term and outcome focused.
Kirsty Williams AM: That's my preference. So, I think the principle--I'd like to think we can all agree around the principle of what a fee and access plan is hoping to achieve, but I think there are better ways of doing it, and I think we should take the opportunity of reform to look at how we can do it better.
Hefin David AM: So, with that in mind, I think we're talking about the future of the Bill, the consultation on the PCET reforms closed in summer 2018--with these important issues in mind and things that are currently ongoing, have you had further dialogue since then with key stakeholders like, for example, Universities Wales and others?
Kirsty Williams AM: On the Bill or on fee and access plans in particular?
Hefin David AM: I'm thinking about fee and access plans as an issue that suggests that there is a need for deep consultation, so with that in mind, with things like that, have you had further discussion?
Kirsty Williams AM: Oh my goodness me, civil servants in the department are constantly in discussion with a range of stakeholders as we continue to develop legislative proposals. I meet on a regular basis with both HEFCW--I meet separately with the vice-chancellors, and I've been very keen to develop a stronger working relationship with chairs, and perhaps we'll come on to issues of governance later. So, we are constantly discussing with stakeholders all options for change--
Hefin David AM: I suppose the message I'm getting as chair of the cross-party group on higher education is that there could still be more direct consultation with stakeholders. That's the message I've received. Now, I've got no evidence to say it has or hasn't happened, but that's the message I've received.
Huw Morris: If I could just chip in for a moment, the Minister's outlined that there is very extensive, ongoing communication both ways with the sector, but the challenge of preparing a Bill is the balancing act between gathering in information--and there's been a general consultation process and a technical consultation process--and wanting to make sure that the Bill that's laid next year hasn't been discussed with anybody else before it comes to be considered by the Senedd. So, the broad principles have been discussed, but specific details of what goes into a Bill or policy instructions that inform a Bill haven't been the subject of consultation--
Hefin David AM: Because that happens at Stage 1.
Huw Morris: Indeed, yes.
Hefin David AM: Okay. Sorry, can I move on to the next item?
Lynne Neagle AM: Oh, you're going on to the next section.
Hefin David AM: Yes, unless there's anything specific--
Lynne Neagle AM: Yes, I just wanted to clarify, if we're moving to a longer term approach to this, how will the new body be able to establish that things are actually working, that the powers are working, if we're working on a five-year time frame?
Kirsty Williams AM: As we've heard, we can't really properly assess fee and access plans in the current arrangements, because it takes time for those cohorts of students to go through and activities to go through. Being able to move to a system where fee and access plans, for instance, could be over a three-year period I think allows universities to be more strategic in some of their investments and some of their activities around fee and access. In a single-year plan, it's almost knee-jerk, it's the need to demonstrate that you're doing something, and doing that within that period of time, rather than a more strategic view--. Can I just say, I know it's not quite subject to this, but we're really moving forward in terms of access and broadening access into the HE sector. For me, student financial support is one aspect of it, but if we're really thinking about social mobility and attracting people into higher education that have never been part of higher education before, our early figures would suggest--they're early figures, and they're subject to change, but in terms of our change to our student support regime, we have seen a 58 per cent increase in the number of postgraduates applying for student support in Wales. When you think about it, when many of us went to university, a degree was the thing that set you apart. Now that more and more students are going to university, it is that postgraduate qualification that sets you apart, but your ability to carry on studying is often limited by access to financial support, so a 58 per cent increase in postgraduate I think is great for those individuals, but it's also great for our economy. We've seen a 35 per cent increase in part-time undergraduates that have been supported by the Student Loans Company; the Open University have reported a 67 per cent increase in students from Wales's most economically disadvantaged areas registering with them; a 57 per cent increase in disabled students; and a 30 per cent increase in black, minority ethnic learners. So, I think that's a really, really positive basis for our sector to continue to work on broadening access.
Lynne Neagle AM: Okay, thank you. Sorry, Hefin--carry on.
Hefin David AM: I'll move on to managing risk, if that's okay. The feedback from Universities Wales suggests that, with the outcome of the 2015 Act, institutions with the strongest track records are more highly regulated than the riskier private alternative providers. Do you think that Act has struck the right balance?
Kirsty Williams AM: I think the Act has created a system where the level of regulation is proportional to the amount and the nature of public moneys received by institutions.
Hefin David AM: Okay. Those were the words used by Universities Wales--
Kirsty Williams AM: No, no, I'm not disagreeing. My view is: I believe that the Act has struck that proportionality. When you look at public moneys going into institutions, I think that the Act is proportionate, myself.
Hefin David AM: So, do you think it's in the interests of students, then, to be at private institutions--? I've seen those private institutions and how they operate; I've seen them at first-hand--they don't operate to the same rigour as public institutions, and they're less regulated.
Huw Morris: Can I just chip in? I think that the category'private'covers quite a wide range of things, and many private institutions are also charities. We don't have the presence of some of the large private charities that are present in other countries, but Stanford and Harvard would count as private universities. So, I think we need to be careful in focusing on the inherent quality of things. We've made charitable status a key reference point in the operation of things at the moment. I think there has been attention drawn to some private providers, particularly in England, but I wouldn't tar them all with the same brush, necessarily.
Hefin David AM: But they fall outwith--if they're not charitable providers running validated courses, for example, they fall outwith the strength of regulation that is currently in place on the universities in Wales.
Kirsty Williams AM: So, we would regulate them on a course-by-course basis, so it's back to the issue of proportionality, isn't it? So, you are automatically regulated for all your courses, if you're one of our main universities, but there is a process that is run by HEFCW on a course-by-course basis to validate alternative providers. And as Huw said, I think we should recognise the nature of that is very, very, very small in Wales, and there is a process to ensure quality provision. If there were concerns about the quality of that provision, that course could be deregulated.
Hefin David AM: And I'm aware that there are a small number of private institutions in Wales, but are you concerned that in the future the landscape may change, particularly with the opportunity to recruit more part-time students? Do you think the landscape may change in future and that the 2015 Act, as designed, wasn't equipped for that, and will the next Act, then, be equipped?
Kirsty Williams AM: I think it's right to say that maybe the previous legislation didn't futureproof for changes. I'm not anticipating a mass influx of alternative providers, in the sense that we've seen across the border, but we will need to ensure that the new commission has powers to regulate and to futureproof.
Hefin David AM: Okay. Thank you, Chair.
Lynne Neagle AM: Dawn.
Dawn Bowden AM: Thank you. We had some evidence from the University and College Union that were concerned about the governance of universities, actually, as being a bigger problem than the regulatory framework in many ways. Can you tell us, perhaps, how the HE Act addresses the issue of poor governance, or is it really just limited to responding to the symptoms rather than the poor governance itself?
Kirsty Williams AM: Well, I think it's true and fair to say that the Bill does not directly address issues around governance in the sector. HEFCW do have well-established assurance practices in relation to governance that would predate the 2015 legislation. But governance--we've talked briefly about some recent history within the sector that I think has certainly brought the issue of governance to the fore once again, and I think there are two important things that we're trying to do about that in the current time, prior to any legislative changes. The first is, as I just said to Hefin, I have sought to have a more direct relationship with chairs of universities and have that one-to-one relationship with them, not in the presence of their vice-chancellors. I challenge them, they challenge me, and I think we've deliberately tried to establish a regular routine of that since I took office. And you'll be aware that, collaboratively--and I'm glad that this has been done in this way because I think if you do it this way, we're more likely to get some success and change--Universities Wales and HEFCW have worked together to undertake an independent review of governance. And I think it's really important that parties have come together to recognise the issues and to agree to take action, because I think if we'd have tried to impose something, we'd have more resistance. So, there is an independent review going on at the moment--
Dawn Bowden AM: Is that the risk review process in--?
Kirsty Williams AM: That's the Gillian Camm review. This is a review that, as I said, Universities Wales and HEFCW have agreed to do together. It's chaired by Gillian Camm, who is the chair of the Leadership Foundation for Higher Education, and she is doing an independent review to advise on changes to governance. And I welcome that, I'm very supportive of that, and that's happening at the moment. As I said, I'm glad that there's been recognition from within the sector themselves that they need to make sure, and they need to give confidence, that governance arrangements are what they should be.
Dawn Bowden AM: So, is that something that you're going to be taking into the PCET Bill, do you think?
Kirsty Williams AM: Yes, absolutely. We're exploring how the Bill could introduce a regulatory condition in respect of good governance, and a commission would be able to set expectations with regard to good governance. I think one of the concerns for me--and I know that this is a concern that is shared by the UCU--is the diversity of governance and who finds themselves in these really important positions. HEFCW don't hold figures on it, but from an approximation that I've asked officials to do for me, currently in the universities that we have, I would say that men make up around 56 per cent of membership of universities'governing bodies; women--44 per cent; BME--as low as 4 per cent. Of course, in individual institutions, it does vary, but I think there is some way to go to making sure that our governing bodies are diverse and that there's an opportunity to look at the student voice in governance going forward, the staff voice in governance going forward, and these are things that we hope to have discussions on whilst we bring the legislation forward.
Dawn Bowden AM: But also, I guess--sorry, Chair--a greater understanding, that anybody going in to become a governor of one of these institutions has a greater understanding of what is expected of them. Do you think that that's a gap that needs to be plugged?
Huw Morris: One of the things that HEFCW have led on with AdvanceHE, the body that encompasses the leadership foundation, is a development programme for governing bodies, and that started earlier--well, it's been going on for some time, but it was recommenced earlier this year, with a session for all of the chairs of universities in Wales. And I believe--I'll need to check this--that there are plans to engage with each of the governing bodies, because, as you rightly say, and this lies behind a lot of what we've been discussing, the activities of these institutions have become much more complex over recent years, and so there is a need for that training and development and understanding also of the fast-changing nature of that activity.
Dawn Bowden AM: Thank you.
Lynne Neagle AM: Okay, just before we move on, can I ask whether it's your plan to legislate on that, as they've done in Scotland?
Kirsty Williams AM: As I said, I don't want to pre-empt scrutiny of the Bill, because we need to be able to come to the committee and do that in the entirety, rather than picking off individual bits of it, but we are absolutely exploring how the Bill could introduce a regulatory condition with regard to governance.
Lynne Neagle AM: Okay, thank you very much. We've got some questions now from Sian on quality assurance.
Sian Gwenllian AM: Okay. We've heard evidence regarding the difficulties caused by HEFCW having a legal duty to quality-assure all the provision in two further education colleges. That sounds to me like some kind of an anomaly or an unintended consequence of the Act. Could you clarify that and explain the situation in that instance?
Kirsty Williams AM: Thank you. My understanding--and as I said, it's a bit difficult, because I can't put myself into the thought process of the Minister at the time and what his expectation was. But, certainly, my understanding is that it was not an unintended consequence, it was an expectation built into the Act that HEFCW and Estyn would work together on these matters. The Act built on what were the quality assessment arrangements in the 1992 Act, which required HEFCW to secure arrangements for the assessment of the quality of education provided by funding institutions. So, as a consequence of that approach, HEFCW's quality assessment duty currently encompasses all the education provided by or on behalf of a regulated institution. So, it is complicated, and Huw can help me out here if I get it wrong, but my understanding is that it was not an unintended consequence, that was the expectation of what would happen when the legislation was passed. Huw.
Huw Morris: I would completely agree with what the Minister has said.
Kirsty Williams AM: As always. [Laughter. ] At least in public, Huw.
Huw Morris: There is the expectation that they will work together in concert. There's a lot of joint operation. I think, going forward, we would expect that to continue. We're looking to the new Bill to try to make that clearer. That was a theme in the general and technical consultation exercises that we've engaged in over the last couple of years.
Sian Gwenllian AM: So, you're happy, therefore, that that partnership has worked. Are you happy with that?
Kirsty Williams AM: Certainly, in our consultation for the upcoming Act, we've generally heard, certainly from our further education colleges, that they've been quite content with the arrangements. No concerns about it, certainly from further education colleges.
Huw Morris: There are differences in the systems of quality assurance as they've historically applied to FE and HE, but I understand that that has meant that, as FE colleges become more interested in HE, they've had to learn new ways, and that's taken a little bit of time. But, I'm not aware of any dissatisfaction.
Sian Gwenllian AM: Okay, which moves us on to this idea of having one quality assurance body or one quality assurance framework. Is that your intention and how will that work in practice?
Kirsty Williams AM: I am aware, and we've listened to stakeholders'concerns regarding proposals to introduce a single quality assessment body. As I said, we recognise that stakeholders are broadly content with the current situation with regard to Estyn and QAA. So, we've been listening to that, following the technical consultation, and policy officials are working through options in regard to ensuring what quality assurance will look like in the commission. As I said, I don't want to pre-empt bringing forward the legislation, but the principles underlying any assurance regime would need to be coherent, need to be effective and need to be comprehensive. What we're also very clear about, and I think it is important to say, is that any quality framework covering higher education will be compatible with ENQA, which I think is really, really important going forward. And by an extension of that, it would be compatible with current UK-wide baseline standards. So, we don't want to create specific problems for the HE sector in Wales.
Sian Gwenllian AM: But, you have touched on this, there is substantial concern in the sector about this offer to move to one assurance body for the tertiary sector. One vice-chancellor has told us:
Kirsty Williams AM: Well, sometimes, I think it is necessary, maybe, to cause a stir. If we don't change things, it does beg the point of,'Why are any of us here if we're not here to sometimes move things forward?'And change is challenging always, but I would like to reassure all of our vice-chancellors and our sector as a whole that we're not going to do anything in the quality assurance regime that would risk what is the very high reputation and standards that Welsh universities currently comply with or would set them apart from institutions across the border or in a European context. Huw.
Huw Morris: I agree, obviously. I think the fear is misplaced, but coming back to another theme in the conversation so far about futureproofing, what we're seeing in the figures that the Minister outlined to you earlier about the growth in postgraduate and the growth in part-time is the desire of a greater number of people at different ages to engage in higher and tertiary education, and quite often that will be in a workplace or it will be in a non-conventional institutional setting. Historically, the quality assurance regimes for work-based learning have tended to sit with Estyn; the assurance regimes for the universities have sat with the QAA. There's quite a lot of learning that all sides have got to engage in if we're going to be able to have continued high quality in these new areas that are being explored. That's an issue not just in Wales. The Augar report, which was published earlier this year in England, drew attention to this as being a major problem in the relationship over the border between Ofsted and the QAA. So, I think we're not looking to impose one institution on anybody, but we are looking to encourage greater synergy in the ways in which quality assurance and enhancement is undertaken in those different areas of activity.
Sian Gwenllian AM: And finally, therefore, looking at overseas providers. Currently, of course, universities can award their degrees to students being taught by providers overseas. We know this created problems for the University of Wales in 2011. They faced a scandal; that's probably the best word to use there. Will the new Bill address these issues?
Kirsty Williams AM: Well, certainly transnational education does present real opportunities for Welsh institutions, but if not managed appropriately and regulated appropriately can cause real risks to reputation to our sector. When I meet with vice-chancellors in universities in different parts of the world, and when I am visiting different countries, one of the great things that I'm able to say is that we have a sector that provides fantastic quality of teaching, excellence in research and a wonderful student experience, and that is undermined if institutions find themselves undertaking TNE activities that put that at risk. So, it's an important consideration for the health of the whole sector that any TNE undertaken by a Welsh institution has the appropriate quality guarantees built into that because it's a problem not just for an individual institution, but it could undermine the very strong reputation that the Welsh sector has as a whole. Huw, was there anything further about TNE?
Huw Morris: Well, just to say that we are live to that, as I know HEFCW and the QAA are. We've had conversations with both in the recent past. There is quality assurance of offshore activity through the QAA. When they visit institutions with their reviews they will look at a selection of those overseas activities and there are periodic thematic reviews of the activity in particular countries. I think we would hope and believe that HEFCW, in its conversations with the QAA, would be keeping that under review to minimise the risk and maximise the opportunities.
Sian Gwenllian AM: So, you're not actually looking to use the new legislation to strengthen the regulation around this.
Huw Morris: The arrangements at the moment are that HEFCW uses the QAA to do the reviews and the inspections. I don't think we're currently looking to mandate the detail of how that should happen. The system at the moment works through co-operation between the institutions and the regulator to make sure the quality assurance system is improving and enhancing things. I think we would look to that as a primary mechanism.
Sian Gwenllian AM: Okay. Thank you.
Lynne Neagle AM: Okay. Thank you. Are there any other questions from Members? No. Okay. Well, can I thank you both for attending this morning and answering all our questions? As usual, you will be sent a transcript to check for accuracy following the meeting, but thank you both for your attendance this morning.
Kirsty Williams AM: Thank you.
Lynne Neagle AM: Item 3 then is papers to note. Paper to note 1 is a letter from the Minister for Education regarding the revised additional learning needs implementation plan. Paper to note 2 is additional information from HEFCW, following the meeting on 18 July, in relation to our post-legislative scrutiny of the Higher Education (Wales) Act. And paper to note 3 is a letter from us to the Welsh Local Government Association on the Childcare Funding (Wales) Act 2019. This is the letter that we agreed we would send last week. Can I ask Members if they're happy to note those? Yes. Thank you very much. Item 4 then. Can I propose, in accordance with Standing Order 17. 42, that the committee resolves to meet in private for the remainder of the meeting and for item 1 on 2 October? Are Members content? Thank you.","Kirsty Williams AM shared that the government had listened to stakeholders'concerns regarding proposals to introduce a single quality assessment body. And she stressed that the principles underlying any assurance regime would need to be coherent, effective and comprehensive. Besides, the quality framework should cover higher education to make it compatible with ENQA, which was considered as highly important going forward, since it would be compatible with current UK-wide baseline standards to avoid specific problems for the HE sector in Wales. Although it might cause a stir, a change must be made in the new situation. Huw Morris also suggested that greater synergy would be encouraged in the ways in which quality assurance and enhancement was undertaken in different areas of activity.",qmsum
"Summarize Marketing's presentation on functional requirements.
Project Manager: Okay. Um welcome to our second meeting. This is the functional design meeting. And I hope you all had a good individual working time. Okay, let's get started. Okay, here's the agenda for the meeting. After the opening um I am going to fulfil the role of secretary, take the meeting minutes. And we're gonna have three presentations, one from each of you. Then we're gonna discuss some new project requirements. Um gonna come to a decision on the functions of the remote control. And then we're gonna close up the meeting. And we're gonna do this all in about forty minutes. {gap} Okay. First I want to discuss the goals of this meeting. First we need to determine the user requirements and the question that we can ask ourselves is what needs and desires are to be fulfilled by this remote control. And then we're going to determine the technical functions, what is the effect of the apparatus, what actually is it supposed to do, what do people pick up the remote and use it for. And then lastly we're going to determine its working design, how exactly will it perform its functions, that's the whole technical side of {disfmarker}'Kay I'll just give you a minute,'cause it looks like you're making some notes.
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Project Manager:'Kay. Oh, well let's go ahead and,
User Interface: {vocalsound} {vocalsound}
Project Manager: {gap} back, previous.
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: So what I wanna do right now is hear from all three of you, on your research that you just did. Who would like to start us off?'Kay.
User Interface: I don't mind going first.
Project Manager: Okay. Um do you have a PowerPoint or no?
User Interface: Yeah, it's in the {disfmarker} should be in the m Project.
Project Manager: Okay.
Marketing: Do you want us to do our PowerPoints now or {disfmarker}
User Interface: You know you could you could do it yourself actually.
Project Manager: Oh.
Industrial Designer: Did you send it?
Project Manager: Save it in the project documents.
User Interface: Put it in Project Documents,
Project Manager: Okay.
User Interface: yeah.
Project Manager: Mm-mm-mm. This one?
User Interface: Sure. {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Okay.
User Interface: Yeah.
Industrial Designer: Okay. Great.
User Interface: Okay. Um well, the function {vocalsound} of a remote control, as what uh we've been informed, is basically to send messages to the television set, for example, switch it on, switch it off, go to this channel, go to channel nine, turn the volume up, etcetera. Um some of the considerations is just um for example the what it needs to include it's the numbers, you know, zero to nine, so you can move to a channel, the power button on slash off, the channel going up and down, volume going up and down, and then mute, a mute function. And then functions for V_H_S_, D_V_D_, for example, play, rewind, fast-forward, stop, pause, enter. And enter would be for like, you know, the menus. {vocalsound} And then other menus for D_V_ as well as T_V_, whether that means like um we can go and decide the brightness of the screen, things like that, all the more complicated functions of menus.
Project Manager: {gap}
User Interface: And we can decide if that's what we want, {gap}, um if we want to include that on the remote, if that's something that would stay on the T_V_ itself, for example.
Project Manager: Okay. Okay.
User Interface: These are two examples. Um and you can see on the left, it's got a lot more buttons,
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
User Interface: and I don't know if you can read it, but it says, step, go to, freeze, um slow, repeat, program, mute, and so those are some of the buttons and so it gives you an idea of s one example. And then on the right, it's a lot more simpler, it's got volume, it's got the play the like circle set, which is play, rewind, but it's also what is {disfmarker} fast-forward is also like next on a menu. So you have functions that are d uh duplicating.
Project Manager: Right.
User Interface: And you have a mute button and then the numbers and the eject, and the power button. So that gives you two different kinds, a more complex and more simple version. Okay.
Project Manager: Ready.
User Interface: And then lastly, it's just the questions that we want to consider like what functions do we want it to include, and how simple, complex it should be? And what functions it needs to complete. Uh, what are needed to complete insulation process,'cause, you know, that's something that also has to be considered and it's gonna be hopefully a one-time thing, when you set it up it should be set to go, but we have to include the functions that can allow it to set up i in the first place.
Project Manager: {gap}
User Interface: So that's it.
Project Manager: Alright. Very good presentation. Thank you. You speak with such authority on the matter.
User Interface: Mm. Left.
Project Manager: {vocalsound} Okay. Who would like to um follow that one up? Now, that we've discussed {disfmarker}
Marketing: I can go.
Project Manager: Okay. Do you want me to run it or you wanna {disfmarker}
Marketing: Yeah, you should run it.
Project Manager: Okay. {vocalsound} Functional requirements.
Marketing: {vocalsound} Mm yes.
Project Manager:'Kay. Alright. Now we have Courtney with the functional requirements.
Marketing: Yes, okay so we tested a hundred subjects in our lab, and we just we watched them and we also made them fill out a questionnaire, and we found that the {vocalsound} users are not typically happy with current remote controls. Seventy five percent think they're ugly. Eighty percent want {disfmarker} they've {disfmarker} are willing to spend more, which is good news for us um if we make it look fancier, and basically w we just need something that really I mean there's some other points up there, but they {disfmarker} it needs to be snazzy and it {disfmarker} but yet simple.
User Interface: {gap} Wait.
Marketing: So that's really what we need to do. And we need we need it to be simple, yet it needs to be high-tech looking. So {disfmarker}
User Interface: And that meaning what?
Marketing: Like {disfmarker} They like I guess use the buttons a lot.
User Interface: Okay.
Marketing: Yeah.
User Interface: {gap}
Marketing: I don't know. It's from my uh research.
Project Manager: Okay, what do you m
User Interface: Right.
Marketing: My team wasn't very clear.
Project Manager: Oh, I'm sorry.
User Interface: Only use ten percent of the buttons.
Project Manager: What do you mean by um the current remote controls do not match well with the operating behaviour of the user, like they have to press the buttons.
Marketing: {vocalsound} That's okay. I I think it's like the engineering versus user,
Project Manager: Okay.
Marketing: whereas like the engineering she showed that the engineering ones are more complex
Project Manager: Oh, right.
Marketing: and users don't really need all of the buttons that are contained on there, because they only use ten percent of the buttons really.
Project Manager: The buttons. Okay.
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Yeah. Okay.
Industrial Designer: We only use ten per cent of our brains. {vocalsound}
User Interface: {vocalsound} {vocalsound}
Marketing: Good point.
Project Manager: It works.
Marketing: It's a necessary evil.
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} yeah.
Project Manager: {vocalsound} Ready for the next slide?
Marketing: Mm-hmm. {vocalsound} And so people say that they typically lose it, as you yourself know, because you probably lose your remote control all the time,
Project Manager: Hmm.
Marketing: much like any small appliance like a cellphone,
User Interface: Lost.
Marketing: and they {disfmarker} we need something simple, because most people, well thirty four percent say that it's just too much time to learn how to use a new one, and we don't want to go {disfmarker} we don't want to vary too far from the normal standard remote,
User Interface: S
Marketing: but I mean they do need to be able to identify it, and R_S_I_, I'm not very sure what that is.
Project Manager: It's okay. It's very important. {vocalsound}
Marketing: Yes, it is important for the remote control world.
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
User Interface: Wait, is that like your {disfmarker} ergonomics like your hand movements or something?
Marketing: Sh
Project Manager: Could be, yeah.
Marketing: Uh possibly.
Industrial Designer: Do we really need t to provide more information on what R_S_I_ is?
User Interface: Like {disfmarker} {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Oh.
Marketing: Uh yeah, that's what my web site said, I
User Interface: Channel, volume, power.
Project Manager: I think that's a pretty good guess though.
Marketing: don't know.
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Marketing: Yeah, I would assume so.
User Interface: It's like if you're holding it {disfmarker}
Marketing: I think we're supposed to know it as remote control experts.
Project Manager: Yeah. It's okay. {vocalsound}
Marketing: {vocalsound} But also s so the channel, the volume and the power buttons are the most important on our company website you can find like the specific statistics concerning to how much each button is used, but those are the definitely the top ones.
Project Manager: Okay. Next slide?
Marketing: Yes. And so personally I think that we need a modern eye-catching design, but it it really needs to be simple. So saying from y your slide, your presentation, the engineering versus the user-specified remotes, I think that we should go with something that's more user-friendly.
Project Manager: User-friendly.
Marketing: Where the engineering ones, the boxes, tend to make it look more complicated than it really is. Um the functionality of the product really needs to be considered as to like what type of buttons do we really need on it. And it needs to be open to a wide range of consumers, so even though we need a small number of buttons, we also need to take in {disfmarker} like are most people going to be using it for a D_V_D_ player, a TiVo, what what exactly are we using it for, as well as the age range. So we need a hip, but not a corny marketing scheme for promoting our product.
User Interface: {gap}
Marketing: And also we found {disfmarker} our team found that speech recognition is {disfmarker} it's like an up-and-coming thing they really {disfmarker} consumers are really interested in it, and since our findings found that people are willing to pay more money for a remote for it to be more high-class we could consider it.
Project Manager: And so just to {disfmarker} just to clarify by speech recognition you mean they would say, channel five, and the thing would go to channel five?
Marketing: I guess so, yeah.
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Okay.
User Interface: {gap} to just say, where are you, and thing beeps, you know. {vocalsound}
Project Manager: {vocalsound} Oh, that'd be lovely.
Marketing: Yeah, I guess we can interpret it like, we can just try out different types of speech recognition within our remote programme.
User Interface: Yeah.
Project Manager: {vocalsound} Didn't they {disfmarker} um didn't our rival companies manufacture a remote that you would press the button on the T_V_ and it would {disfmarker} the remote would beep so if you have lost it {disfmarker}
User Interface: It's kinda like what the remote phone used to do.
Project Manager: Mm. Oh, yeah, that's true.
User Interface: You know like go to the base.
Project Manager: We could definitely include that if we wanted to.
User Interface: Yeah.
Project Manager: If it's within our price. Okay. Are we ready for our last presentation, Amber?
Industrial Designer: Yeah, I'm just trying to move it.
Project Manager: Okay.
Industrial Designer:'Kay. I think it should be there, working design.
User Interface: Working design.
Project Manager: There we go.
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Project Manager:'Kay.
Industrial Designer:'Kay. Uh I didn't get a chance to complete this one,'cause some of the tools that I was given were frustrating.
Project Manager: Oh my bad. {vocalsound}
Marketing: Oh that's fine.
Industrial Designer: Uh okay, so method method of our design, I think I just start listing th some of the things that we actually need to put into this.
User Interface: Help me.
Industrial Designer: We need a power source, we're gonna need a smart chip if we're gonna make it multi-functional. Um extra functions will probably need an additional chip. Either that or the smart chip will have to be extremely smart.
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Marketing: What exactly is a smart chip?
Industrial Designer: Usually a smart chip is just a chip that's been programmed and designed so that it can complete a fair range of functions.
User Interface: Well, how much extra would the additional chip be? Is that gonna push us over our production costs?
Industrial Designer: I wouldn't think so,'cause we could probably get it from like, in bulk, from a a newer company. And they tend to sell their chips pretty cheap.
User Interface: Mm-hmm.
Project Manager: Okay. Ready?
Industrial Designer: Um yep, nothing here.
Project Manager: That's okay.
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: Um power source, I figured, batteries,'cause they're easily available. Typically a remote has either two double A_s or four triple A_s, sometimes three. Uh it really kinda depends on the size of the actual remote itself.
User Interface: {gap}
Industrial Designer: Um a large on-off button, {vocalsound} demographically we're moving towards an older generation of people, so a large on-off button would probably be good.
User Interface: {vocalsound} {gap}
Project Manager: Hmm.
Industrial Designer: Selection button for various entertainment devices, so you want something that will permit you to select the D_V_D_ player or the T_V_ or the stereo system. Um smart chip that perverts {disfmarker} uh that permits, sorry, universal application again, something that'll allow us to skip over between devices, and that's kinda it.
Project Manager: {gap}
Industrial Designer: Uh this is my fifty second design.
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: Power source over here. We're gonna have a switch obviously between the power source and the rest of it, and you're gonna need the switch. Um extra bulb could just be for flashiness, um subcomponent which would be like a way of diverting the power to different parts of the the device. Um the chip and of course the infra-red bulb, so it can communicate with the various devices that it needs to talk to.
Marketing: So what exactly we are looking at, is this like the front of the remote?
Industrial Designer: This is just like a rough schematic.
Project Manager: So this would be the front?
Industrial Designer: So this is the internal workings.
Project Manager: So the red would be the front of the remote though, right?
Marketing: Oh okay.
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
Project Manager: Okay.
User Interface: Yeah, that's gonna be what's communicating with the T_V_, but the other bulb, I think, is good to just to indicate, I'm doing something, it's sort of like a reassurance.
Project Manager: The l {vocalsound} the light up kind of {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Yeah, so you don't have to stare at that infra-red,
Marketing: Like that we know the battery's working.
Project Manager: Yeah.
Industrial Designer:'cause you know when the battery starts dying in your remote currently, you have to actually stare at that bulb and go, okay, when I push this button, is it working?
Project Manager: Hmm. It'd probably be lighting up the key too,
Marketing: Okay.
Industrial Designer: We can skip that whole thing.
Project Manager: right?
Industrial Designer: Yep.
Project Manager:'Kay.
User Interface: Yeah.
Marketing: Yeah.
Industrial Designer: So you can put it in the dark. {vocalsound}
Project Manager: The buttons.
Marketing: Yeah, and that's good.
Project Manager: Okay.
Marketing: We should make it glow in the dark. {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Yeah, definitely.'Kay nex R Ready?
Industrial Designer: Yeah, that's it.
Project Manager:'Kay, any p'Kay?
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Marketing: Mm'kay.
Project Manager: Anything you wanna add for personal preferences though, you f you said already that we needed a large on-off button, you think. Anything else?
Industrial Designer: I think that that's a good idea, because you know that's one of the most important buttons.
User Interface: Just {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Okay.
User Interface: Well, should it be larger buttons in general, you know like uh the examples that I had, they were swi quite small. So should we try and go for something that has l larger buttons?
Marketing: I think we should. Like I think that would be in a as in {disfmarker} like in {disfmarker} for the design, sorry, um. I think we should definitely go with buttons that don't look like a normal remote,'cause most remotes have small square buttons,
Project Manager: Mm.
Marketing: I think we should do something like maybe bigger and round like bubbles.
User Interface: Ovals. Yeah, yeah.
Project Manager: Okay. Okay, let's talk about all of our {disfmarker} We'll come to decision later about all the components that we need to include, let's um wrap up this one, and {vocalsound} I'm gonna go back to my PowerPoint,'cause we need to discuss the new project requirements which you might've already seen flashed up on the screen a bit earlier. {vocalsound} Wait, come back. Alright. Sorry, let's go through this. Alright. Here we go. New product requirements. First it's only going to be a T_V_ remote. We're trying not to over-complicate things. So no D_V_D_, no TiVo, no stereo.
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} Okay.
Project Manager: It's not gonna be multi-functional.
User Interface: {gap}
Project Manager: Hey. And we th need to promote our company more, so we need to somehow include our colour and our company slogan on the remote. We're trying to get our name out there in the world. Okay.
User Interface: {gap}
Project Manager: And you know what teletext is?
User Interface: Yeah.
Project Manager: {gap} in States we don't have it, but um it's like they just have this channel where just has news and weather, kind of sports,
User Interface: I know.
Marketing: What is it?
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: it's very um bland looking, it's just text on the screen,
User Interface: Yeah,
Project Manager: not even {disfmarker}
User Interface: it's like black, black and white kind of {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Yeah, just black with just text.
Marketing: Like running along the bottom?
Project Manager: Yeah.
Industrial Designer: You can also get the kind of the T_V_ guide so {disfmarker}
User Interface: It'll give you the sports.
Marketing: Wait, is it like the Weather Channel where it's got like the ticker running on the bottom or something?
Project Manager: Kind of.
User Interface: Except the entire screen.
Project Manager: Yeah it's the whole screen.
Industrial Designer: It's the entire screen is just running information at random.
Project Manager: So anyway {disfmarker}
User Interface: You can pick sports, you can pick the news, you entertainment,
Industrial Designer: Seemingly.
User Interface: you know it's like {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Right.
Marketing: So it's like a separate channel from like what you're watching?
Project Manager: Right. But it's becoming out-dated now, because of the Internet.
User Interface: Yeah.
Project Manager: Nobody needs to go to the teletext channel to check the news, {vocalsound} and we have twenty four hour news channels now too, so {disfmarker} Those are our new product requirements. Alright. Mm-hmm.
Industrial Designer: Okay.
Marketing: Okay.
Industrial Designer: So, do we have to include the company colour within that?
Project Manager: Yes. It's part of the logo. Okay.
User Interface: Company colour being yellow. {vocalsound}
Project Manager: What we're going to do right now is come to some decisions, definitive that we can all agree on, about um the target group and the functions and just definite things that we need to do and then we'll close up the meeting. So. Alright. {gap} Whatever. Okay. So our target group is {disfmarker} You mentioned um older people? Would it just be universal for everyone, you think?
User Interface: Mm-hmm.
Project Manager: Because I think even if something has large buttons, as long as they are not childishly large, like even technically {disfmarker}
User Interface: It's gonna make it nicer. Yeah.
Project Manager: non-technically challenged people are gonna use it. I mean they want something user-friendly, so {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Mm well, even if we kept the regular standard size of remote, if we reduced the buttons down to the ones that people are saying that they use the most often and a couple extra,
Project Manager: Yeah.
Industrial Designer:'cause they're saying they only use ten per cent of them,
Project Manager: Yeah.
Industrial Designer: then we should be able to accommodate fairly decent sized buttons.
Project Manager: Okay, so we want um for our target group would we say, I mean, young and old, all age ranges, all um, not kids obviously, right? Or kids?
Marketing: No, kids need to know how to use a remote, I would think.
Industrial Designer: Most of them will intuitively pick it up though.
Project Manager: {gap}
Marketing: They gotta change between Disney Channel, Cartoon Network.
Project Manager: Okay, so we're going to go anywhere from kids to adult in the age range {disfmarker}
Marketing: Yeah, I think we need it all.
Project Manager: Um what about technic technical um specifications, like how how technically literate are these people who are going to be using our remote?
Industrial Designer: {gap}
Marketing: Um I would say we should say dumber than the average person.
Project Manager: Okay.
User Interface: We should go for the lowest denominator.
Marketing: Yeah.
Project Manager: Right, okay. So so they need no technical experience to operate {disfmarker}
User Interface: High school educated.
Industrial Designer: {gap} how'bout little to no, because there is no way that you are gonna be able to make it no.
Project Manager: Okay. And we also need to determine the specific functions of this, just to get it all out on paper. So we said it needs to send messages to the T_V_, needs to change the channel, turn on and off, just basic simple stuff like this. So if you have something just say it and we'll add it to my meeting minutes.
User Interface: Well it's channel, on-off button, volume, mute.
Project Manager: Mm-hmm, volume.
Marketing: And channel. Yeah. Those are the most important ones.
Project Manager: Right. And we wanna keep um {disfmarker} I'll make a note here that we wanna keep the number of buttons down. Correct, because people only use ten percent.
Marketing: Yeah.
Project Manager:'Kay. Hey, what else?
User Interface: Um.
Project Manager: Um.
Industrial Designer: Do we want this thing to be able to be found easily?
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: I think so. What do you {disfmarker}
Marketing: Sure, yeah.
User Interface: {gap}
Project Manager: A finding kind of device or {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: And
Marketing: I need {disfmarker} we we need a like homing device.
Project Manager: Yeah, ho homing device. {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: like if this is gonna get lost underneath the coach, how are we going to accommodate the quick ability to find it?
User Interface: Oh right yeah okay.
Project Manager: Mm'kay.
User Interface: Tracking.
Project Manager: Okay.
Marketing: Because people really are looking for a remote that's more high-tech.
Project Manager: Right.
Industrial Designer: What if we gave it a charger? And on the charger, just like a phone, like you get a portable phone and it's got a charger, and if you d leave your phone somewhere, you push the button to find it, and it finds th the phone beeps for you.
User Interface: But you got a base.
Marketing: Do you think people'll really go for that though?
Industrial Designer: It's useful for the remote phone.
Marketing: Because {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Hmm.
Marketing: Yeah.
Project Manager: Would that add to our costs at all, I wonder?
Marketing: I would think so, because you'd have to develop a base.
Project Manager: Right.
User Interface: Well, if you have the base, you could start putting in a charger and then you have a different kind of battery.
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
Marketing: Hmm.
Industrial Designer: Rechargeable batteries are cheaper usually.
User Interface: Yeah.
Project Manager: Okay. I I think we can make a decision about that later. Uh we'll still put that as a point that we need to discuss. So that would include battery source {disfmarker} Power source rather. Is it going to have a charger, or is it going to be run strictly off batteries? And we also need to deal with the issue you mentioned of speech recognition, if we want that.
Marketing: Right.
User Interface: Well, then we could {disfmarker}
Marketing: Do w
User Interface: If we have the speech recognition then we can start aiming at a like another kind of more handicapped disabled uh demo demographic.
Project Manager: Mm.
Marketing: Well, th there's the people who desire speech recognition, there's the different demog demographics have different desires, I don't know if you guys ge
Project Manager: You could um {disfmarker} we could hook it up.
Marketing: It wouldn't copy onto the the thing'cause it's black,
Project Manager: Oh.
Marketing: but all the different age groups have different desires for speech recognition. So {vocalsound} basically older people don't really care.
User Interface: {gap}
Marketing: It's really the people twenty five to thirty five. I feel those are the people that really watch a lot of T_V_ though.
Project Manager: Mm-hmm.
Marketing: They're the ones that get addicted to soap operas and
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: And if and if we introduced it when they're this age, they're going to probably always buy a remote that has {disfmarker}
User Interface: Well {disfmarker}
Marketing: just sitcoms and stuff. Right.
User Interface: Well, then then do you put the voice recognition {disfmarker} do you put the r like receiver on the actual television, in the base, or in the actual remote,
Marketing: So {disfmarker}
User Interface:'cause then you've already got remote in your hand, why you just gonna speak to the remote,
Project Manager: Right.
User Interface: whereas if you just speak in general and you don't have to have the remote in your hand and like talk at it.
Project Manager: Yeah. {gap} and the speech recognition could be part of the lost and found device, too. If we said, find remote, locate remote, or something.
Marketing: Right.
Project Manager: A certain phrase then it could beep. I dunno. Just throwing it out there.
Marketing: Yeah.
Project Manager: Well {disfmarker} {vocalsound}
Marketing: {vocalsound}
User Interface: Still {gap} fifteen minutes.
Project Manager: Okay, anything else we wanna discuss?
User Interface: Um. Well, do we wanna include the numbers like zero through nine? Can we conceive of leaving them out?
Project Manager: Um.
Marketing: Wait, on the remote itself?
Project Manager: {gap}
User Interface: Yeah, like you have one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, zero.
Project Manager: How how,
Marketing: Well, we definitely need those.
Project Manager: yeah, how would you leave those out?
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
User Interface: Well, I don't know, I mean, if you can {gap} like well {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Unless you could say the channel.
User Interface: I don't know, if there's just a way of leaving them out?
Industrial Designer: I think people would find that too foreign.
Project Manager: Yeah, that's true.
Marketing: Yeah.
Project Manager: And also remember that in this day in age we need, you know, like a hundred button, too.
Marketing: You definitely need {disfmarker}
Project Manager: I used to have a remote that did not even go up past like fifty. {vocalsound} So I couldn't {disfmarker} whenever I got cable, I had to get a new T_V_.
Industrial Designer: It's when we get satellite.
Project Manager: Mm. {gap} get your own remote, or digital cable.
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
Project Manager:'Kay. Um. I guess, we're gonna discuss the project financing later, making sure that we can fit all of the stuff that we want to on our budget. Um.
Industrial Designer: Yeah,'cause I don't have any material pricing information available to me at the moment, so {disfmarker}
Project Manager:'Kay. And don't forget we need to include the colour of our company and the logo.
User Interface: The colour being yellow?
Marketing: Wait.
Project Manager: I'm guessing. And the R_R_.
User Interface: And how do we {disfmarker}
Marketing: I feel like a ye I feel like a yellow one would be too garish.
Industrial Designer: R_ the double R_.
Project Manager: We could just have the logo in yellow,
User Interface: Can't make it entirely {disfmarker}
Project Manager: or maybe a yellow light for the keys.
Industrial Designer: Or is the l
Marketing: Or put like stripes, oh yeah, yellow lights.
Industrial Designer: Yeah, {vocalsound} yellow could be and it could {disfmarker} doesn't have to be huge.
User Interface: Well if you have like a {vocalsound} {disfmarker}
Marketing: Yeah.
User Interface: Hang on. If you have this sort of strip kind of down at the bottom {gap} the base of it, just like yellow with the R_R_.
Project Manager: Right. So we've simplified, we don't need all those um play, fast-forward, rewind,
User Interface: Right, yeah.
Project Manager: or no menu buttons.
Marketing: Yeah.
Project Manager: So we've pretty much pared it down to on-off, volume, mute, channel up and down, um the numbers {disfmarker} Yeah. {vocalsound}
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Marketing: Yeah.
Project Manager: {vocalsound} Um can we go back to {disfmarker} I'm gonna look really quickly back at those
User Interface: Two examples.
Project Manager: examples and see if there is anything.
User Interface: Yeah.
Project Manager: Which one is yours, technical functions or functional requirement?
User Interface: Oh, it's a {disfmarker} Yeah.
Project Manager: Okay.
Marketing: Yeah, audi audio settings and screen settings, we need those like audio settings mono, stereo, pitch, screen settings like brightness, colour, or do we just want that accessed accessed from the television itself?
Project Manager: The T_V_. I think that that's fine just for the T_V_. I mean how often does the average user need to do that kind of stuff?
User Interface: Well, the other option is sort of like down at the bottom, like farther away, you just have this sort of box inset where it's like the buttons that you don't use as much, but occasionally you will use.
Project Manager: Hmm.
User Interface: and so it's like {disfmarker}
Marketing: Yeah,'cause we need to {disfmarker} we definitely need to have buttons for like sub-titles and things like that. It's'cause the foreign film market is expanding and stuff, and like on television like I know f k living in Los Angeles it's tons of Spanish network television if it has English sub-titles it's definitely helpful.
Project Manager: Couldn't we do that all through one button, something, a menu button, that pops up with a menu on the T_V_ that says, you know, audio, video, whatever, language,
User Interface: I don't {disfmarker} well, I don't know.
Project Manager: you know?
User Interface: Right.
Marketing: So we need up, down, and side-to-side buttons.
Project Manager: For the menus.
User Interface: Well, that could be {disfmarker} No you could just double up with like the channel or the volume buttons.
Industrial Designer: Mm-hmm.
Project Manager: That's true.
User Interface: Channel is just up and down.
Marketing: Yeah, okay. Okay, yeah.
User Interface: And then add a {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Something that looks mayb you know.
Marketing: Such as, yeah, the one the one over there on the left the engineering centred one.
Project Manager: Y right, right right right.
User Interface: Yeah.
Project Manager: That one?
User Interface: So we just have it like {disfmarker} add a menu button then for the various things needed,
Project Manager: Right.
User Interface: including v voice recognition if we have any like settings for voice recognition now
Project Manager: In the middle perhaps.
User Interface: included in the menu.
Project Manager: Yep.
Marketing: Ooh, I just got an idea for a design.
Project Manager: {gap} good. Anybody have anything else they'd like to bring up in this meeting?
Industrial Designer: I had something, but I forgot.
Project Manager: {vocalsound} Okay. {gap} get out of here. Let's go back to the meeting closure then and see what we need to do next. Mm. Alright. After this meeting we're gonna be sent a questionnaire and summary again which we need to reply to that e-mail. And then we're gonna have lunch break. And after lunch thirty minutes of individual work time. Um I'm gonna put the minutes {disfmarker} I put the minutes for the first meeting already in the project documents folder, if you'd like to review them. And I'm gonna type up the minutes for this one as well. Um here's what we're each going to do. The I_D_ is going to work on the components concept, um U_I_D_ the user interface concept, and you're going to do some trend watching.'Kay. Specific instructions will be sent to you by your personal coach. And if anybody has anything they would like to add? No? Okay, well, this meeting is officially over. Thank you all.","Marketing first shared the results of their lab tests. It was found that users preferred a fancier but yet simpler remote, and as a result, their product should be high-tech looking but also user-friendly. Since the research found that most users would only use ten percent of the buttons, they decided to only keep the most necessary ones on their remote. Users also claimed that remotes tend to be lost easily. Finally, since speech recognition was popular among users, the remote should have this function as well.",qmsum
"Summarize the whole meeting.
User Interface: Hi.
Industrial Designer: Hi.
Project Manager: Hello.
Marketing: {vocalsound}
User Interface: Oh.
Project Manager: Good morning.
User Interface: Good morning.
Industrial Designer: Morning.
Marketing: Good morning.
Project Manager: Uh before I start with the with the meeting I have a few things to tell you about the the setting we're in, uh because we're uh being watched by uh Big Brother. So um {disfmarker}
Marketing: By Big Brother?
Project Manager: Yeah. {vocalsound} Yeah.
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Marketing: Okay.
Project Manager: This uh {disfmarker} These are cameras, so are these. This thing uh that looks like a pie,
Marketing: Mm-hmm.
Project Manager: are actually all microphones.
Marketing: Yeah. Okay.
Project Manager: So you must be careful with uh with uh all this. And uh as I can see you uh you have placed your laptops uh exactly on the place where it must be. And that has to do with the camera settings, so we don't have our uh laptops in front of the cameras.
Marketing: Of our faces.
Project Manager: And {disfmarker} Indeed. So they can see our faces.
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: {vocalsound} Okay.
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Welcome at the kick-off meeting. My name is uh Danny Wolfs. {vocalsound} Uh this is the agenda for today. Uh first a little opening. Uh I will introduce myself, uh and uh I think it's very uh good to introduce uh yourself. Uh then uh a little bit of acquaintance, acquaintance to uh to to ourselves. So uh we get to know each other. Uh that will be done uh with a tool training from the he these two uh smart boards. Then the project plan. What we're going to do, and how we're going to do it. Uh and discussion about that and a little closing at the end. {vocalsound} Okay uh, my name is uh Danny Wolfs. I'm the Project Manager. What's your name?
User Interface: I'm Juergen Toffs. I'm the User Interface Designer.
Project Manager: User interface, okay.
Industrial Designer: Hi, my name's uh {gap}. I'm the Industrial Designer.
Project Manager: Industrial, yes.
Marketing: I'm uh Tim {gap}. Um my function is the Marketing Expert.
Project Manager: Okay, thank you. First a little about the project aim. Uh the the the aim is to make a new remote control. Uh maybe you have read uh read the website. It's a very uh, yeah, very uh ambitious uh company. They uh they wanna do something else. I w Uh there must be a new remote control. Uh first of all uh it must be original, uh and trendy. That's two things really uh close to each other. But at the same time uh user-friendly. And they have uh {disfmarker} Yeah, that's uh very important uh for them. Uh there are three stages. There is a functional design. So uh what are we going uh to uh to do? What are we going to uh uh make f uh kind of functions in the remote? And why are we going to do it? Then the conceptual design. How are going to do it? {vocalsound} And that's uh really global. Uh because at the detailed design, how, part two, uh we go uh to dig in uh really about how the the te the technical of {disfmarker} If it's uh it's possible technical-wise.
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Uh each stage is uh {vocalsound} uh is broken up in two uh two stages, individual work and a meeting. So it's uh it's very straightforward. {vocalsound} Okay, the tool training. We have two smart boards. {vocalsound} This one is for the presentations, the PowerPoint presentations or the Word presentation of whatever you uh you had. Uh and this is uh only for uh drawing. So uh we uh must let it uh stand on this uh this programme. {vocalsound} This is called a smart board
Marketing: {vocalsound} Speaks for itself.
Project Manager: thing uh {disfmarker} Yeah, it speaks for itself. Um and as you uh may have heard, the documents in the shared folder uh can be uh showed on this screen. Not in y the the My Documents. So if you wanna show something, put it in the shared folder. {vocalsound} Uh {disfmarker} This uh is {gap} very straightforward, with the save, the print, the undo, the blank, the select, the pen. Well, I don't uh gonna explain it all,
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: because I think you know uh how it works. Um we must not forget uh everything we draw on here, uh all must be saved. We we may not delete anything. So uh if you have uh drawn something, save it. Never delete it. That's a very important uh thing.
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Okay. Uh little uh little {vocalsound} kinda exercise to uh know each other.
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: {vocalsound} At uh the white board on the left. Every uh every one of us uh must draw our favourite animal,
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: {vocalsound} and uh tell uh tell us why we uh had uh chosen that animal. Uh important is that we use different colours, {vocalsound} and uh different pen widths. Widths. Widths.
Marketing: I have a question.
Project Manager: Yes?
Marketing: Um this exercise, um did the company board tell you to do it,
Project Manager: Yeah.
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Marketing: or uh did you just make it up yourself?
Project Manager: No no no. It's uh it's uh {vocalsound} {disfmarker} I I I must do it.
Marketing: It's part of the introduction,
Project Manager: Yeah, yeah, yeah.'Cause we uh really don't know each other,
Marketing: okay.
Project Manager: and uh it's kinda new. So getting used to each other, we can uh have a little fun then, before we uh dig in really to the hard stuff.
Marketing: Okay. {vocalsound}
Project Manager: That kind of thing. Would you start with drawing your uh favourite animal?
Marketing: Um, yeah. I don't know really how it works. But maybe you can show us first?
Project Manager: {vocalsound} Okay, okay. Yeah, okay. Drawing goes with uh this thing. Do not touch your hand on uh this little uh thingy here. That's uh important.
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: So hold it uh like this.
User Interface: {vocalsound} {vocalsound}
Marketing: You g you get electrocuted or {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Yeah, kinda. {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: So, {vocalsound} um {disfmarker} You must p p uh push a little uh {disfmarker} Good. Because {disfmarker} And uh wait uh wait a few seconds. It's not uh fully real-time, so uh watch it.
User Interface: Ach. {gap}
Project Manager: Oh yeah. Well I'm gonna paint in the red.
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Oh.
User Interface: Ooph.
Project Manager: That's the background colour. {vocalsound}
Marketing: {vocalsound}
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Well, undo. Um {disfmarker} The pen? No. One minute please. {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Yeah, that's the one. Well, five. Okay. {vocalsound}
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: {vocalsound} My favourite animal huh?
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Marketing: It's like Pictionary? {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Yeah, you can guess what it is.
Marketing: The the one who says it first {vocalsound} gets a raise.
Project Manager: {vocalsound} May uh paint uh next.
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} {vocalsound}
Marketing: {vocalsound}
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Marketing: It's a pork? {vocalsound}
Project Manager: {vocalsound} No, it's not an orc. {vocalsound}
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: You don't see it uh at the ears?
Marketing: Mm yeah, I have it at home. {vocalsound}
Project Manager: You have an orc at home?
User Interface: Very artistic.
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Thank you.
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: So it's a cat. {vocalsound}
Marketing: What's it called?
Project Manager: Simba.'Cause uh we have a cat at home
Marketing: Ah.
Project Manager: and he's called Simba.'Cause he looks like the uh the the lion from The Lion King.
User Interface: Okay. {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Marketing: {vocalsound} Miniature size?
Project Manager: So we uh found it kinda cool to uh name it after a lion.
Marketing: Okay. {vocalsound}
Project Manager: He's happy with us, so uh he's smiling.
User Interface: Wow. He does have body uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Huh.
Project Manager: No, only the face. Because we have we have twen twenty five minutes. So we uh {disfmarker}
Marketing: Okay. We have to speed up.
Project Manager: Yeah.
Marketing: Remember you use uh different colours, and different pen widths.
Project Manager: Yeah. Okay, who wants to go next?
Marketing: I {disfmarker} Okay.
Project Manager: Yeah?
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: So choose a colour, choose a pen width and draw a {disfmarker}
User Interface: You don't have to change the colour and the pen width during uh the drawing.
Marketing: Save it.
Project Manager: Yeah.
User Interface: Or {disfmarker}
Marketing: You have to save it.
Project Manager: Save it, okay.
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Marketing: I've done it. New?'Kay.
User Interface: You have to draw uh push hard on the pen or uh {disfmarker}
Marketing: Mm uh {disfmarker} Not really.
Project Manager: Kind of firm touch.
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Marketing: That one.
User Interface: Oh. Uh hmm.
Marketing: Yeah? Okay. Open. Which one is it? Smart board?
Project Manager: Yeah.
User Interface: Okay.
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Marketing: Okay. And now? Okay. Okay, thanks.'Kay, I've speed up.'Kay, that's fine. Line width.
Industrial Designer: By the way, why was your cat uh red?
Project Manager: Because uh my cat is red uh at home.
User Interface: Oh.
Industrial Designer: Oh, okay. {vocalsound}
Project Manager: And I have red hair, so uh must be red.
User Interface: It's a very bloody cat.
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} Oh, yeah, sure.
User Interface: It's a frog. {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: No, it's a turtle. {vocalsound}
User Interface: {vocalsound} Uh it's an apple. {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Marketing: {vocalsound} It's not an apple.
Industrial Designer: Must be a dog. {vocalsound}
User Interface: A dog? {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
Marketing: Hmm. Colour. {vocalsound} Something like this. Smaller.
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
User Interface: Huh?
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
User Interface: Oh, it is a turtle.
Project Manager: It is a turtle. Why a turtle? Why? Tim?
Marketing: Um {disfmarker}'Cause I liked Teenage Mutant Hero Turtles.
Project Manager: {vocalsound} You watched it a lot?
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Marketing: {vocalsound} Uh?
Project Manager: You watched it a lot?
User Interface: It's uh inside its shell. You'll be uh finished sooner.
Marketing: No, it's uh {disfmarker}
Project Manager: It's a scared turtle.
Marketing: No no. {vocalsound} It's coming up. Mm. Uh.
User Interface: Wow.
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
User Interface: {vocalsound}

User Interface: Yes {gap}. Okay. Wha Thank you.
Marketing: Yeah? Here you go.
User Interface: Yeah. Um {disfmarker}
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
User Interface: How did it work?
Project Manager: Format? And then you have the the current colour,
User Interface: Performance?
Project Manager: you can change. So no red or green.
User Interface: And a pen?
Project Manager: And uh line uh width. I had five.
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Tim had {disfmarker} Uh Tim, what kinda line width did you have?
User Interface: Um {disfmarker}
Marketing: Uh the big lines were like nine.
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Okay. It's a dog.
User Interface: Well, very good. {vocalsound} I just uh thought I'd pick the easiest one.
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} Uh.
Project Manager: Okay. Why a dog? You have a dog at home?
User Interface: Well, we had a dog, a few years ago.
Project Manager: Had a dog?
Marketing: Uh, it's p
Project Manager: Yeah?
User Interface: And and it, {gap} yeah, when it died we didn't get a new one or something.
Project Manager: Ah.
User Interface: But uh {disfmarker}
Marketing: It's pretty good uh {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: You have an artistic uh inner middle.
Marketing: {gap} {vocalsound} An artist.
Project Manager: {gap} {vocalsound}
User Interface: Uh a Graphical User Designer, so {disfmarker}
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: Hmm.
User Interface: Hey.
Marketing: Think you uh picked the wrong uh function. Wrong job.
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
User Interface: {vocalsound} Oh.
Marketing: {vocalsound}
User Interface: No. Can work together. Ah colour.
Project Manager: So I think you can see it's real uh really a easy programme to use. Not difficult at all.
Marketing: Wha
User Interface: {vocalsound} Well,
Project Manager: Okay,
User Interface: it's okay {gap}.
Project Manager: thank you. {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Marketing: {vocalsound} That's enough,
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Marketing: thanks. {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Janus? The last one?
Industrial Designer: Yeah, sure.
User Interface: Yeah.
Industrial Designer: Uh thanks.
Marketing: I wonder.
Project Manager: Yeah. After a cat, a turtle and a dog.
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: I think he's gonna draw an elephant. {vocalsound}
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: I figure I should do something like that,
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: but I'm gonna do something much more difficult.
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Uh-oh.
User Interface: Uh-oh. Oh, he is the artistic {gap} design.
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Marketing: I'm gonna design a remote uh {vocalsound} remote control animal. {vocalsound}
User Interface: {vocalsound} Remote control animal.
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} Exactly. Uh {disfmarker}
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
Marketing: {vocalsound} Oh. {vocalsound}
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
Marketing: Sorry.
User Interface: Well with the interface, it might be easier to ha to draw here and display there uh.
Marketing: Yeah.
Project Manager: {gap}
Marketing: That that might be easier. But at the other hand, uh a pen like that is easy to hold in your hand, and {disfmarker}
Project Manager: No.
Marketing: I think it's easier to draw.
Project Manager: Better to draw with a with {disfmarker}
Marketing: Yeah. With a pen than with a mouse mouse.
User Interface: Than on the, with {disfmarker}
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
User Interface: Yeah, I m I mean like uh like on here, drawing drawing uh. And then displaying on screen, but {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Marketing: Mouth. Oh, okay. Yeah. W with this paper it's too mu too expensive. {vocalsound}
Project Manager: But what is he uh?
User Interface: Too expensive, yeah.
Project Manager: Is it a rabbit?
Industrial Designer: Yes. {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Do you have a rabbit at home?
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: No.
Marketing: It's a rabbit with uh broken legs? {vocalsound}
User Interface: A green rabbit.
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} No. {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Is it a white rabbit f It's the white rabbit from The Matrix.
Industrial Designer: Yeah, exactly. {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Okay, then yeah.
User Interface: There, the g white green rabbit.
Industrial Designer: So.
User Interface: {vocalsound} He's a little bit stoned there. {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Uh I figured this is a pretty b good impression of a rabbit.
Marketing: Yeah. It will do.
Industrial Designer: Uh uh {disfmarker} Uh well.
Project Manager: Okay. Finishing touch and then we're going further.
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Marketing: Project Manager? Uh {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Yeah?
Industrial Designer: Where does the pen go? Just uh {disfmarker}
Marketing: Have you been uh counting the time?
Project Manager: Yeah, a little. {vocalsound}
Marketing: Okay. Let's go on then.
Project Manager: Well, I think the dog is the the most uh artistic.
Industrial Designer: Uh I figured the rabbit was actually the most uh impressive. {vocalsound}
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Don't choose for youself.
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} Oh, sorry. {vocalsound}
Project Manager: That's selfish. Okay, now we're gonna dig into the to the serious stuff.
Marketing: It's pretty abstract.
Project Manager: {vocalsound} Uh the selling price for the remote will be uh twenty five Euro, and the production cost uh may not be more than uh twenty and a half Euro. So uh from my point of view, I don't think it's uh gonna be very uh very high tech, high definition, uh ultra modern uh kinda remote, for twelve uh fift uh twelve and a half Euro.
Marketing: {vocalsound} {vocalsound}
Project Manager: {vocalsound} Uh the profit we must make with uh the new remote is uh fifty million Euro. So that's a lot. We have to sell uh a lot of uh {disfmarker}
User Interface: Yeah, how much is it?
Marketing: Like how much?
User Interface: Hundred million uh remotes or something?
Project Manager: Uh I think uh w when the selling price is twenty five, uh uh you got two million, two million remotes.
User Interface: Oh yeah.
Industrial Designer: Twenty million. Two million, oh yeah, two million. Yeah.
Project Manager: But our marketing range is uh, market range is international. So we have uh virtually the whole world we can sell uh we can sell our r remotes to. At least that uh countries which have uh a television.
Marketing: Yeah.
Project Manager: Um {disfmarker} So now it's time uh for us to uh going uh to discuss a little uh things. You can think about uh experience with a remote control uh yourself, at home. What you think might be uh a useful uh new feature. What uh what can distinguish our new trendy remote control from all the others. Um so uh let's uh let's uh discuss a little. I'm gonna join you at the table. {vocalsound} Well what what's the most uh important thing at a remote control?
User Interface: Um well I think the most important thing of a remote control is that you can switch channels. And my opinion is you should keep it as basic as possible. Uh {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Okay. So not a not a remote control who uh uh which can uh can be used for television and a D_V_D_ and radio and {disfmarker} Or just only {disfmarker}
Marketing: Yeah. I think so. Uh but I have some points. Can I show them on the on the big screen? Maybe?
Project Manager: If you have them on uh {disfmarker} I can uh {disfmarker}
Marketing: Yeah. Yeah, I can find {disfmarker} Uh.
Project Manager: Okay. Oh, in case you want it {disfmarker} This is a dead kind of fly. Between the the the, yeah, the the uh {disfmarker}
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Marketing: Screen?
Project Manager: Yeah, be The screens.
Marketing: Okay.
User Interface: Is it possible to open pen drawings in this uh on this screen?
Project Manager: {vocalsound} No no no. Only {disfmarker} All the drawings go there, at the left uh {disfmarker} {gap}
User Interface: Uh but um which {disfmarker} The ones we made on the {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Oh, that pen drawings. Uh no, I think uh when it is uh in Word and you have saved it in the Shared Documents folder, you can show it there.
User Interface: Oh, only in Word,
Project Manager: Yeah.
User Interface: okay.
Marketing: Okay, I have some uh points from marketing point of view.
Project Manager: Yeah.
Marketing: Um just the standard thing li things like uh intuitive, uh small, fairly cheap. Uh it's pretty cheap, twenty five Euros. Uh brand independent. Um I think, it doesn't have to matter uh which brand your T_V_ or other thing is. Um {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Yeah. Okay. Five minutes.
Marketing: Five minutes?
Project Manager: Yeah.
Marketing: Okay, I'll wrap it up quickly. Um I personally think it has to be multi-purpose.
Project Manager: Yeah.
Marketing: Uh most of the remote c uh remote controls are uh just for one purpose.
Project Manager: Yeah.
Marketing: And uh by making it multi-purpose, it uh has a new feature, adds a new feature to the market, and distinguish from uh from current products.
Project Manager: Mm-hmm.
Marketing: Um maybe some other technology than infrared. Uh I rather find it very annoying um, like when someone is standing in front of the T_V_ then you can't switch it. Um {vocalsound} think about um sending it over radio waves or bluetooth.
Project Manager: Okay. Okay.
Marketing: That might be a little bit uh expensive. Um {disfmarker} And something like an L_C_D_ screen.
User Interface: For what purpose?
Marketing: Um uh like I said here um {disfmarker} Maybe it's easy. It's nice as an added feature feature, that um, {vocalsound} when you're on a certain channel, you can see on the L_C_D_ screen uh what programmes are coming up or {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Okay. So it be uh a multi-purpose uh very technically uh high uh
Marketing: From my point of view, yeah.
Project Manager: remote? Yeah, it must be really uh innovative, technical-wise?
Marketing: Yeah, it has to be uh {disfmarker} Yeah, our company is very uh good in making new innovative uh things.
Project Manager: Yeah. So yeah, I I agree with you.
User Interface: {vocalsound} We {disfmarker}
Marketing: So i i i i
Project Manager: So we must focus on things who are really uh really add something to uh to {disfmarker}
Marketing: To the current market.
Project Manager: Yeah.
Marketing: Look, {vocalsound} you got some cheap uh remote controls there. They just uh {disfmarker} Yeah, you got a dozen of'em.
Project Manager: No.
Marketing: But when you enter a new market with a remote control and
Project Manager: Mm-hmm.
Marketing: uh wanna gain market share
Project Manager: Yeah.
Marketing: you have to do something special, I think.
Project Manager: Yeah. But we have to keep an eye that it's {disfmarker} Uh at the beginning of such a project, it's it's it's very uh cool to talk about, well, this would be cool, that would be cool.
Marketing: Yeah.
Project Manager: {vocalsound} Uh but we must not uh lose uh sight of the the user uh uh friendly uh {disfmarker}
Marketing: Yeah, of course.
User Interface: And and the price. {gap}
Marketing: But it's {disfmarker} But but this is just from marketing uh aspect.
Project Manager: Yeah okay. Yeah. Okay.
Marketing: I don't know anything about user interface or {vocalsound} design.
User Interface: {vocalsound} Okay.
Project Manager: {gap} And that's because we have him. {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} And and him. {vocalsound}
User Interface: And him. {vocalsound}
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Okay, uh next meeting will start in thirty minutes. So uh you uh will have uh individual actions where I presume uh will be some feedback, uh via the m the mail. Um {vocalsound} the the the Industrial uh Designer has to uh look at the working design. {vocalsound} Uh the User Interface Designer has to look at the technical functions. So that's the thing we uh discussed.
User Interface: Yeah. Um one thing uh,
Project Manager: Yeah?
User Interface: we must first agree on uh what we're going to m going to make. Do we {disfmarker} Are we going to use um it it for multiple systems? Or uh {disfmarker} We should have some agreement on that before we {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Okay. Um wha
Marketing: {vocalsound} Mm uh I I don't think we have to be, we have to agree on that. Uh {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: I figure we could get back to it on the next meeting actually.
Marketing: I think th that's a pha Yeah.
User Interface: Okay.
Marketing: That's a phase further.
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
Marketing: Ju just uh make some mock-ups, some some general ideas.
User Interface: Ah okay.
Marketing: And and then we can plan {disfmarker} Yeah.
Project Manager: Yeah.
Marketing: We can plan further, I think.
Project Manager: Yeah. But maybe, because uh you are working on the user requirements, you are working on the technical functions, we uh must uh have a little or kinda uh uh uh {disfmarker} How do you call it? Uh {disfmarker}
User Interface: Consensus on the, what we're gonna do.
Project Manager: Uh a little plan on on what we're going to do. So you don't uh uh come up with the user requirements who don't fit the the the the technical functions at all. Some basic things we co we want to going to do. Uh I think that's well uh {disfmarker} Yeah. Will come in handy.
Marketing: Mm yeah.
User Interface: Yeah.
Marketing: I don't know. You decide. {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Okay.
Marketing: You're the Project Manager.
Project Manager: W {vocalsound} He says {disfmarker}
User Interface: if the technical functions have to be designed, I I've gotta know for what kind of machines they will be.
Project Manager: Yeah.
User Interface: Or do we use it a text screen? Or uh will it be with uh with bluetooth or {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Well, th that's that's really a step further. But if you say uh {vocalsound} is it uh uh one way or multi-purpose, that's a {disfmarker}
User Interface: Okay. Mm-hmm.
Marketing: Uh tha that's a same step further.
Project Manager: Why?
Industrial Designer: Yeah, actually it is.
Marketing: Yeah.
Project Manager: Why?
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} Then looking at individual components,
Marketing: Uh.
Industrial Designer: so that's actually a f step further.
Marketing: Yeah.
Project Manager: Yeah.
Marketing: Like we all have a list of uh things that has to b that have to be in it, or how it has to be like. And then in the next meeting we decide
Project Manager: Yeah.
Industrial Designer: Yeah, we can take it from there.
Marketing: w what it's gonna be.
Project Manager: Okay.
Industrial Designer: Yeah, I agree uh, we can take it from there.
Marketing: A And then you s then you can delete uh
Industrial Designer: Or edit.
Marketing: the o the obsolete uh details.
Project Manager: Okay. So uh
Marketing: I think.
Project Manager: each individually i individually uh must think on what's uh at uh his point of view is the most important. And uh then we're going to fit uh all the pieces together the next meeting.
Marketing: Yeah.
Project Manager: I must finish off now,
Marketing: Yeah.
Project Manager: so it's over. You uh will receive specific specific instructions uh by your personal coach. And I see you in uh thirty minutes. Thank you.
User Interface: Okay.
Industrial Designer: Okay, cheers.
User Interface: Sorry.
Project Manager: {vocalsound} Be careful.
Marketing: Damn.
User Interface: Yes.
Marketing: Success? {vocalsound}
User Interface: Yeah. No. Come up.","Project Manager gave a brief introduction of the new remote control project for television sets. During team building, team members got to know each other by drawing their favorite animals with technical devices. When it came to the financial targets, Project Manager planned that the remote control would be priced at 25 Euros on the premise of the 12. 5-Euro production cost, and the profit is targeted at 50 million Euros. The market range would be international. Then, ideas about new technical features of the remote control were proposed, such as radio waves and bluetooth, in order to distinguish the product from current ones. Finally, some general arrangements for the next meeting about user requirements and technical functions were made by Project Manager and each team member was required to think on the most important thing from their own point of view.",qmsum
"What did the group discuss about differences of care provision in different parts of Wales?
Lynne Neagle AM: Good morning, everyone. Welcome to the Children, Young People and Education Committee. We've received no apologies for absence this morning. Can I ask if there are any declarations of interest from Members, please? No. Okay. Thank you. Item 3 this morning then is a scrutiny session on early childhood education and care, and I'm very pleased to welcome Julie Morgan AM, Deputy Minister for Health and Social Services; Jo-anne Daniels, director of communities and tackling poverty at Welsh Government; and Nicola Edwards, deputy director of the childcare, play and early years division in Welsh Government. Thank you all for your attendance. We're very much looking forward to the session. If you're happy, we'll go straight into questions, and the first ones are from Hefin David.
Hefin David AM: Good morning, Deputy Minister. What are your primary objectives? Is it supporting the development of children or getting parents into work?
Julie Morgan AM: Well, I think you'll be aware from the range of programmes that we've got that we do feel it's important to support both children and parents. There's obviously lots of evidence to show how important the early years are for children, how important they are for their development, and so, that is one of our primary objectives. But we also know how important it is for parents to have stable jobs, reasonably paid, so that can also help with the development of the children. So, we really see it that our plans are for both parents and children, and we believe that a high-quality, early-childhood education and care system can provide that. And, of course, in terms of when we talk about jobs as well, I think it's really important to remember that the childcare system is a big employer as well and a very important employer. So that, actually, itself provides jobs.
Hefin David AM: So, the evidence we've seen suggests that, historically, Governments in the UK and devolved have focused on primarily getting parents into work. So, are you suggesting then that your focus is to change that and move towards early child development?
Julie Morgan AM: No, what I'm saying is that we want to give parents the opportunity to work. We don't want childcare to be a barrier to parents working because we think that working is one the best routes out of poverty, but we do also want to make sure that children have the greatest experience that they can have in the early years. So, we see it as one.
Hefin David AM: Okay. And that's quite a policy challenge to deliver both at the same time.
Julie Morgan AM: The situation as it is is complex, and I think it needs simplifying. It is a challenge, but it's probably one of the most important challenges we've got in Government, because what we offer to families with young children is one of the most important things we do.
Hefin David AM: And in your evidence to the committee, you said that the Welsh Government's approach'will build on a wide variety of programmes that are continually developing in order to support parents, families and children during the early years.'And you've just said you want to simplify that. How do you simplify that, particularly with regard to the provision of funding and the way these things connect from the birth of a child into school? How will simplification look, and what will happen?
Julie Morgan AM: Well, we're not at the stage of being able to say what it will look like at the moment, but we're looking at ways of simplifying, because I think it's absolutely right, it is a very complex system, because it's grown up from all different routes. But we are having lots of pilot projects that are looking at ways of simplifying the system. We have got pathway projects in, I think it's eight local authorities, who are looking at ways of joining up the whole system. So, we are looking at that, and I absolutely except that it is very complex and we want to find ways of making it simpler and easier to understand. So, we are working with local authorities and health boards to see how we can actually work together and simplify things.
Hefin David AM: And it's good to hear that that's your objective. Can I just come back to the first thing you said:'We can't say yet what we're going to do'?
Julie Morgan AM: No.
Hefin David AM: So, when will we have a policy plan and something that we can interrogate in more detail?
Julie Morgan AM: Well, I think we are near getting to an announcement where we will be able to say what direction we're going in, and because we have had--. Some of this work has been going on for a year or so, and we're getting the results of those pathfinder projects coming in. So, when we do have all those results, we will be able to say the direction that we want to go in, and I hope we'll be able to do that very soon.
Hefin David AM: Before Christmas?
Julie Morgan AM: I hope so.
Hefin David AM: Okay. And finally from me--
Julie Morgan AM: I'm sorry I can't say too much about that because we haven't actually--. We need to--.
Hefin David AM: Well, it does sound like something is imminent.
Julie Morgan AM: Yes.
Hefin David AM: Okay. And that's as far as you're willing to go. And if that's as far as you're willing to go, then I'll stop asking.
Lynne Neagle AM: I've got a supplementary from Sian.
Hefin David AM: Okay.
Julie Morgan AM: Yes, that's fine.
Sian Gwenllian AM: I just want to understand a little about the pilot, the pathfinders in eight local authority areas. Is the focus there on the child or is it on parents returning to work?
Julie Morgan AM: The focus is on an early years system, but we've worked both locally and nationally. So, it's looking at both. I mean, actually, I think, perhaps, Nicola, would you like to or one of you like to describe one of the programmes?
Sian Gwenllian AM: And can you just explain the vision? Is it a child-centred early years provision that we're thinking of in these pathfinder--?
Jo-Anne Daniels: So, in'Prosperity for All', we set out that early years was one of the key priority areas, and within that we said that we wanted to create a more joined-up and more responsive system. So, when we talk about a system, we're talking about the services that are provided by health boards, so health visiting, midwifery, speech and language support, other kinds of therapeutic services, as well as all the important services that local authorities are providing, such as support for parenting, advice and guidance, employment support and childcare, obviously. And we've got eight pathfinders. I'll try and remember each of them. So, Flintshire, Newport, Blaenau Gwent, Neath Port Talbot, Swansea, Ceredigion, Pembrokeshire--and then I've missed one, I think, because I've only got to seven--who have been working with us to look at how all of those services are currently delivered in their local area and whether and how they can reorganise those services to improve accessibility, to improve take-up, but essentially to improve the efficacy of those programmes in terms of supporting children, but often, obviously, in supporting children you have to support parents too and support the home.
Sian Gwenllian AM: So, would you say it's a child-centred approach?
Jo-Anne Daniels: Absolutely, because it's about making sure that we deliver the best start in life for children in Wales, but obviously parents are a critical element of that, so can't be excluded.
Lynne Neagle AM: And how long have they been going for?
Jo-Anne Daniels: So, those eight pathfinders started their work in--I think it was--February this year. And they're still in the very early stages in terms of actually unpicking and mapping the current provision of services across their areas and then moving on to the stage where they'll develop proposals for how they might change the delivery of early years.
Lynne Neagle AM: Okay, thank you. Julie.
Julie Morgan AM: Just to say also, the one in Flintshire is also testing the impact of consistent funding rates for education and childcare. So, that's been going longer than the others. So, that's another important area because there's an evaluation of that project under way at the moment.
Lynne Neagle AM: Thank you.
Jo-Anne Daniels: Sorry, but Caerphilly was the one that I forgot to mention.
Lynne Neagle AM: Oh dear. [Laughter. ]
Hefin David AM: That's absolutely unforgivable. [Laughter. ]
Lynne Neagle AM: Hefin. [Laughter. ]
Julie Morgan AM: Very significant.
Hefin David AM: In your report, the'Alignment of the Childcare Offer for Wales to the Foundation Phase', one of the recommendations was that'The Welsh Government, local authority education and childcare policy and delivery teams could merge'. So, looking behind the scenes, those disparate parts of policy, delivering the foundation phase and childcare offer should merge. Is that the case? Has that been put under way and should we be looking at this structure in more depth?
Julie Morgan AM: Well, probably not at the structure at this time because the report that you're referring to was looking at the first year of the delivery of the childcare offer and it did make a number of points, which we have taken on board. For example, we issued guidance last year regarding the delivery of the foundation phase, which supports widening the number of non-maintained settings that are able to deliver early education and we're also supporting co-location and partnership working between education and childcare providers through our capital investment programme. I think it's about PS81 million that we put into the capital investment where we are developing childcare facilities co-located with the education facilities, because that was one of the things that came out from this report you're referring to. And, I mean, obviously, early years is one of the key priorities within'Prosperity for All'and, obviously, education sits within one portfolio with the Minister for Education, and childcare is with me. But we're doing what we can to work together to try to bring those together, and that was one of the proposals in that report. But it's still very early to think about, at this stage, a structural change.
Hefin David AM: And I remember when you were on the committee here with me, sitting next to me, we had those discussions about co-location. I know the problem with not having co-location is that you could end up seeing a child travelling between three or more locations during the course of a day. Are you suggesting now that the actions you're taking will resolve that issue universally, or will it lead to a piecemeal resolution? And, if so, to what extent, what percentage of children will see that resolved as an issue?
Julie Morgan AM: Certainly, the co-location is not going to solve it universally because although we've been able to develop a lot of new facilities, or build on old facilities, there will be a lot of areas that we won't have covered. So, I can't say that there's going to be a situation where everything is going to be co-located because I don't think that would be feasible, and, for some of the providers, they wouldn't be in a position to move to a school. But ideally it's a good situation, but, certainly, I think the discussions that there were on the committee, it's not ideal to take children for long distances between different providers, let alone the effect it has on the climate change issue. It's whether it's good for children as well. So, I can't say that they will ever be co-located, but as I said in response to your earlier question, we are encouraging the development of the foundation phase in non-maintained settings, which, obviously, is quite significant.
Lynne Neagle AM: Okay. Thank you. I've got some questions now from Janet Finch-Saunders.
Janet Finch-Saunders AM: Thank you, Chair. What is the Welsh Government doing to address the big differences in the amount of early childhood education and care provision available in different parts of Wales?
Julie Morgan AM: Right. Well, thank you very much for that question. I mean, obviously, it would be good to see a greater degree of consistency, but I think it's important to acknowledge that there are reasons for that variation. Now, early education, of course, is the responsibility of the Minister for Education, and we are aware that different local authorities have adopted different patterns of providing early education. For example, local authorities are funded to provide 10 hours minimum of the foundation phase for three and four-year-olds across Wales, but there's quite a variance in how much is actually provided, with some local authorities providing a lot more historically. So, it does mean that there is a different pattern across Wales, according to what local authorities do. But what I could say is, of course, the quality is very good, as the Estyn reports have shown; that the quality provided, the delivery of the foundation phase, is very good. But it does vary in terms of what is offered throughout Wales, and that is the decision of the local authorities, and it is a historical thing. I refer to this pilot in Flint, which is trying to test paying the same rate for foundation phase and childcare. We're going to have an independent evaluation on that soon, in November this year, so that will help us. Obviously, I think local authorities'role in all this is absolutely crucial because they are the local, nearest people to decide how things develop in their own areas. And then, of course, we've got Flying Start, which is geographically targeted, which uses the data from income benefit to decide which are the areas where that is being delivered. And that is delivered where the highest proportion of children aged nought to three are living in income-dependent households. So, again, that determines the pattern throughout Wales. With Flying Start being geographically targeted, with the education being determined by the local authorities about how much there is, we know that there is a variance throughout Wales. We'd like to see facilities developed in each local authority throughout Wales that would answer the needs of the families and the children in those areas.
Lynne Neagle AM: Before you move on, Janet, Sian's got a supplementary.
Sian Gwenllian AM: Just in terms of the foundation phase, there have been cuts, of course, in expenditure in that phase. How concerned are you about that and the impact that that will have on the way in which the foundation phase is taught in our schools? The foundation phase is now part of the education improvement grant, which has seen a reduction of 10 per cent, and it has to compete against other expenditure streams within that greater pot of funding. So, are you concerned that money is being lost and that that will have an impact on standards in the foundation phase?
Julie Morgan AM: I haven't seen any evidence. Obviously, I must reiterate the foundation phase does come under the Minister for Education, but I haven't seen any evidence of any standards being lowered, and the reports from Estyn are very good. In fact, I think the foundation phase is one of our great joys, that we absolutely celebrate it, and so I'd be very concerned if I thought there was any drop in standards in the foundation phase, and I certainly haven't had any evidence of that. I would want to guard against that.
Sian Gwenllian AM: Exactly, but if there are fewer teaching assistants in the system because of the cuts, it's going to impact on standards, at the end of the day.
Julie Morgan AM: I think we have to be very careful to see that lower standards are not implemented, because it was groundbreaking when we brought it in, and it has proved to be a great success, so we want to make sure that's guarded.
Lynne Neagle AM: Thank you. Janet.
Janet Finch-Saunders AM: Going back to my original question about the big differences in amounts of early childhood education and care provision in different parts of Wales, the Welsh and UK Governments have followed a demand-driven approach to the childcare market, with subsidies mainly given to working parents. Is that a mistake? Should it be more universally available?
Julie Morgan AM: Well, some of our provision is universally available in certain areas. For example, the Flying Start provision is universally available in geographically defined areas, and I think that's very important, because that does mean that there isn't stigma, and so, in those areas, everybody can take advantage of it, and yet it is reaching those who are most in need because it's reaching those areas. So, I think that there is a purpose behind that. In terms of when you say demand led, could you elaborate on that?
Janet Finch-Saunders AM: I know that--we've just had a useful briefing from David Dallimore, and, basically, there is this theory that there are too many resources--the demand-driven approach is based more on certain factors: geographic spread in terms of it being more universal, and whether that's the right way. How do children then mix with peers from different backgrounds, in their own peer or age group?
Julie Morgan AM: It is demand--
Nicola Edwards: [Inaudible. ]--because the offer is targeted at working parents--
Janet Finch-Saunders AM: Yes, yes.
Nicola Edwards: --obviously, then the amount of availability is based on how many parents apply for it and take it up. Is that the context of demand led in that--
Janet Finch-Saunders AM: Yes.
Nicola Edwards: Right, okay.
Julie Morgan AM: It is universally available to all parents who meet the eligibility criteria of working, and I think what you're saying is that it should be available to everybody.
Lynne Neagle AM: I think the point that Janet's making is that some areas have traditionally got more childcare anyway because they have traditionally had more demand in those areas, so there's not a level playing field to start from. Is that correct?
Janet Finch-Saunders AM: Yes.
Julie Morgan AM: I think that, historically, that is definitely true, and when you look at the take-up of the childcare offer, it's certainly taken up in some areas with a very high take-up rate. I think Ynys Mon was nearly 90 per cent or something--
Sian Gwenllian AM: They need more money, because they haven't got enough funding.
Dawn Bowden AM: So does everywhere.
Sian Gwenllian AM: No, to meet the demand.
Julie Morgan AM: In other areas, it's much, much lower--in some of the cities, I know. So, there is a big range in take-up--
Janet Finch-Saunders AM: So, do you intend to bring something forward to address that?
Julie Morgan AM: We are planning to extend it. We're looking at the possibility of extending it to parents who are in education and training. So, we are widening the offer, yes. Obviously, we have to wait for the evaluation of that. It would be great to be able to offer it to absolutely everybody, but obviously we have got the finance to look at in terms of how we do that. But we are certainly planning to expand it.
Lynne Neagle AM: We've got questions on the offer in a little while. Janet.
Janet Finch-Saunders AM: Does the Welsh Government intend to develop an integrated approach, then, against all settings? If so, given the current inconsistencies, how can quality be assured?
Julie Morgan AM: We are developing a more integrated approach towards the early years. As I've said, we're trying to have the foundation phase operating in more non-maintained settings, and we're already developing that. But Estyn and CIW will continue to inspect and regulate the early years sector to ensure standards, and, since January 2019, CIW and Estyn have moved to joint inspections for the non-maintained settings that are offering the foundation phase. So, that is a very positive move, I think, and is absolutely making sure that standards are maintained, because if we are having the foundation phase in non-maintained settings, that is a challenge where we want to be sure that the standards and the philosophy of the foundation phase are maintained. So, we have got the system of inspection to ensure that.
Janet Finch-Saunders AM: And finally from me, what specific steps have been put in place to take forward the commitments from the Welsh Government's 2017 childcare/play early years workforce plan to build a better understanding of the workforce's Welsh language skills to enable support for the sector to be targeted and to identify where capacity needs to be built for the future to meet the needs of the early years sector in a bilingual Wales?
Julie Morgan AM: We think this is very important, and we're pleased that 29 per cent of children taking up the childcare offer are in Welsh or bilingual settings, so we think that's very good. We have established a specific programme to develop Welsh language skills in the childcare and play workforce with the National Centre for Learning Welsh, to develop workplace Welsh language skills across the sector. So, we're actually working with that, and I think you've done something with those recently, haven't you? I don't know if you want to--
Nicola Edwards: Yes. So, we have a stakeholder group where we've brought together a variety of people with an interest in the early years, childcare and play sectors, and we had a presentation just last month from the national language centre about the education programmes that they're rolling out, and how this is all coming together, which is quite interesting. We've been working quite carefully to make sure that the variety of work-based learning programmes that we provide and offer are also available in Welsh and bilingually. Recruitment and retention within the childcare and play sector is quite challenging in any case. Recruiting and retaining staff with really good Welsh language skills adds an extra dimension to it, and that it's a point that Mudiad Meithrin makes to us quite regularly, that they do struggle to find staff with the right skills. So, upskilling the existing workforce is a key part of it, but also doing more to attract people in with Welsh language skills in the first place in terms of the training courses that we're taking forward, and thinking about that in the context of the targets within Cymraeg 2050 and the aim to get to one million Welsh speakers. So, as the Deputy Minister said, we've got quite a number of children accessing the offer in Welsh-medium or bilingual settings at the moment. We're going to be doing some baselining work against that in terms of local authorities'Welsh in education strategic plans and education places, and what we can then do to increase the number of childcare places in parallel with that so that you can make sure that you start that pathway through learning Welsh, interacting with education and childcare through Welsh at a much earlier stage.
Lynne Neagle AM: Suzy, you've got a supplementary.
Suzy Davies AM: Just on this early point, anybody who's been through the Welsh education system, which is 20 years now, will have some Welsh language skills, obviously to differing degrees. For the entrants that are coming into childcare training now, there are going to be very few of them, realistically, with no Welsh at all, so what's actually being incorporated into the early years care training to make sure, at that stage, that the Welsh language skills are being developed, as opposed to an add-on later on?
Nicola Edwards: You're quite right. Most people coming through the education system will have some awareness of Welsh although I think it's probably important to remember we do also employ people from outside of wales.
Suzy Davies AM: Yes, but the majority, being realistic.
Nicola Edwards: But they don't necessarily have Welsh that is appropriate. They've got Welsh that they've developed in school. It's not necessarily appropriate for then teaching that language to children, who may be coming from families who don't use Welsh at home. So, that might be the first interaction that child has with the language. So, there's a lot of that in terms of child development and how you develop children bilingually, particularly if they're coming from English-medium homes, and reinforcing the language in language choices. There will also be some people who are, perhaps--we see this quite a lot in the office--quite confident in terms of speaking Welsh but less so in terms of some of the paperwork, the reporting, the writing and the interacting with parents more officially, which we need to think about as well. But it is mainly about getting people to a point where they can transmit that language onwards in a confident and meaningful way.
Suzy Davies AM: Okay. And it's ingrained in the early years training.
Nicola Edwards: Yes.
Suzy Davies AM: Okay. That's fine. Thank you for that. Thank you, Chair.
Lynne Neagle AM: Just before we move on, you said that 29 per cent of the take-up of the childcare offer is either through Welsh or is bilingual. Have you got any figures about how many children are accessing it in Welsh only?
Nicola Edwards: We will have. It becomes--. With the way we do it, it's because of the way that the setting defines their language category, and that's how we collect it. We do go down to individual child level, although it's anonymised, data collection on a termly basis. So I'll have a look and see if we can send you through the last term.
Lynne Neagle AM: Maybe if the committee could have a note, that would be really useful.
Nicola Edwards: Yes, that's fine.
Lynne Neagle AM: We've got some questions now on childcare from Dawn Bowden.
Dawn Bowden AM: Thank you, Chair. Deputy Minister, the evaluation of the childcare offer, when it was published last year, said that there was very little evidence currently available to determine what its impact was. You're going to be producing a second evaluation in November this year; do you expect to see some indications now of the impact?
Julie Morgan AM: Well, the evaluation of the first year of the childcare offer was very limited, because the childcare offer wasn't available throughout the whole of Wales. And it was a very early implementation phase. So, obviously it takes time to grow. And the evaluation for year 2, I think, will also show a limited impact for the same reasons. The offer became available across the whole of Wales only last April. So we've only got since last April that it's actually been fully available. And the parental survey was released to parents in June 2019, therefore any impact on parents in the authorities coming on board in the second year will also be negligible. So, it's from the next one, however, we hope that we will get more information.
Dawn Bowden AM: So you think, by the time we get to November 2020, you might have a better picture.
Julie Morgan AM: The evaluation will be more meaningful, we think, then, yes.
Dawn Bowden AM: Okay. I take that point. What the first year's evaluation did show, however, was that 94 per cent of respondents said that they were already using formal childcare before the offer came into place. A couple of things, really: are you surprised at that, and is that likely to inform the way that you develop the offer in the future?
Julie Morgan AM: No, I'm not surprised at all. When it started off, it was only available in seven local authorities. In terms of how the families found out that it was available, they found it out through the childcare providers, where they already had their children there. So it was absolutely what we would have expected, and that will continue. But, of course, we were not able to fully advertise the childcare offer until it was available in all the local authorities, which was last April. So we are planning, this autumn, quite a big push now to try to make it available to everybody--so everybody knows about it. So, no, this is the pattern we would have expected, and I think anybody who's involved in starting up something in childcare will know you have to wait a number of years before you actually see it being fully taken up.
Dawn Bowden AM: I guess the question that it raises in my mind is: does this mean that, actually, it hasn't been an incentive to get somebody back into work, because they were already in work and already had childcare provision? What you've done is you've directed money to people who were already spending that money anyway. So it hasn't been a move towards getting people into work because they couldn't afford childcare.
Julie Morgan AM: Well I think that that is something that we are moving towards, because the take-up of the offer is actually increasing each month, which is why I call it a great success. At the end of July, we hit almost 16,000 children accessing the offer, which obviously means that there are 16,000 families benefiting from this, and the feedback that we have had from parents is that they have been able to--. They've got more money available, which is obvious, which is great, because obviously more money is available to plunge into the economy and carry out that sort of thing, and we've got examples of parents who've been supported into work through programmes like Parents, Childcare and Employment to begin with, and then have gone on to access the offer. So, that's again a progression. So, I think we are seeing signs that people are moving on, have got more ability to be flexible in the work that they're doing, but I hope that when we look at it again, we will be able to see people actually moving into work because of having the access to childcare.
Dawn Bowden AM: Okay. Before--
Lynne Neagle AM: Are you going to move on? Sian's got a supplementary.
Sian Gwenllian AM: Just a question on funding for the childcare offer. If you foresee that there's going to be more people going to be taking up that offer through the fact that you're marketing it more, what if the same situation arises that has happened on Anglesey? The take-up has been very good there, but the money that the Welsh Government has been allocating to Anglesey doesn't match that. What if it happens in every local authority right across Wales? Are you confident there's going to be plenty of money available to respond to that demand?
Julie Morgan AM: Based on the current levels of take-up and looking at the rates of increase each month, we expect to spend in the region of PS50 million to PS55 million in this financial year. Our published plans already include the provision of PS40 million, and we're absolutely committed to making available the total funding that is needed to deliver on the offer. It is fantastic to see the offer being so well received on Ynys Mon, recognising, as Janet said earlier, it is demand led. We are managing it within the normal budgetary process. Local authorities will get the full funding that is needed. It's this year now that the big increase has happened; the previous two years--
Sian Gwenllian AM: So, local authorities won't have to find the extra money out of their own pots.
Julie Morgan AM: No, absolutely not. This is funded by the Welsh Government.
Sian Gwenllian AM: Yes. You can assure them.
Lynne Neagle AM: Dawn.
Dawn Bowden AM: Thank you, Chair. You've already alluded to this in answer to Janet earlier on, about extending the childcare offer to those in training and education. You also talk about'on the cusp'of returning to work. So, I'm not quite sure what'on the cusp'of returning to work is, but from the committee's point of view, we're very pleased that you've reached that conclusion, because it was one of the recommendations that we had following the scrutiny of the Bill. So, can you say a little more about that, bearing in mind that I'm also conscious that you've told Hefin you're going to be making an announcement shortly? So you may not be able to say too much. But a little bit more about the inclusion of parents in training and education, what'on the cusp of returning to work'is--what that means from your perspective--and how you've arrived at that decision now, six months into the programme. What is it that's made you move towards that conclusion?
Julie Morgan AM: Well, obviously, the children and young persons committee made a very good case for education and training, in particular; I think that was one of the things that was at the top of the list. What we've committed to do is to review the programme, particularly looking at how we could bring in education and training, and that review will report early next year. So, early next year, we will have a view on how we could go forward. But the other thing that's also happened is that, obviously, with the new First Minister, that was one of his manifesto commitments--that he would bring education and training in. So, we're obviously following the--
Dawn Bowden AM: Because that was one of the key drivers for that as well.
Julie Morgan AM: Yes, so that is another of the key drivers, as you said--the committee and what the First Minister said. There are a wealth of programmes supporting parents into education, training or work, and many of those do provide support with childcare costs. But we have, by rolling out this programme, the childcare programme, highlighted some gaps where people have felt that they, particularly people who are in full-time education--and I can think of a number of people who are actually doing PhD studies--who are--the letters may have come in from some of your constituents--not able to access the offer as things stand. So, we are looking at people who are in full-time education and training. We're using the definition by the Office for National Statistics, aren't we, in terms of education and training. And on'on the cusp of work', maybe that will have to be something we have to look at differently--those people who are actually maybe undertaking very short training programmes, preparation for work, maybe actually having interviews, where they need help with childcare, that they're sort of almost there. So, they may have to be dealt with in a different way, but I think we do want to look at those. This is expanding the offer; it's not making it universal, but it's moving on.
Dawn Bowden AM: So, what are the--? Overall, then, what are the factors that you're having to take into account? Is it going to be what is needed in order to encourage people back into work? Is it going to be cost? Is it going to be a combination of all of those things? What are going to be the key factors that you're going to be looking at?
Julie Morgan AM: Well, the position now is that anybody who fulfills the criteria in terms of the number of hours they work, we would look at that in terms of education and training, and then, this expression'on the cusp of work'we may have to look at differently, because they may not fulfil those numbers in terms of number of hours training. So, we'll get a criteria, and then they will have access to the childcare offer. But I just have to emphasise that there are ways of getting help with childcare already, and we wanted to make sure we don't duplicate. That's why this field is so complex, shall we say, because there's so many different ways that you can actually get help, and we want to be sure that we don't duplicate--
Dawn Bowden AM: Sorry, Julie. So, all of this is going to be incorporated in this announcement that you're going to be making shortly--
Julie Morgan AM: No, this review will report early next year.
Dawn Bowden AM: Okay. My final question--
Lynne Neagle AM: Before you move on, sorry, I've got a couple of supplementaries. I've got Suzy, then Sian. Sorry, Dawn.
Suzy Davies AM: Just on the cost element, because if you do roll out this programme, obviously, on the back of evidence through a review, it is going to cost extra money. Early years is one of the eight priority areas for Government. There are fairly generous Barnett consequentials coming from the comprehensive spending review and announcements on schools from the UK Government, and while I accept that you've only got annual commitments there, they're still substantial. How much money have you managed to secure for early years from the most recent announcement, and when have you planned to actually use that, maybe for some of this work?
Julie Morgan AM: Have you got some information on that?
Nicola Edwards: The budget process is ongoing internally, so I think'secured'is probably a slightly premature phrase.
Suzy Davies AM: Am I allowed to ask instead how much you've asked for, then? All I'm after is some reassurance that you will be getting some of this money, and as it is one of the eight priorities, certainly we would expect to see you getting a substantial amount of money for early years.
Julie Morgan AM: As one of the Government's priorities, we would expect to get any money that came as a result of any Barnett consequentials.
Suzy Davies AM: Okay. And it will be in the draft budget that we know for sure if it is successful.
Julie Morgan AM: It's all in the process--
Lynne Neagle AM: And the committee will want to look very carefully at that, obviously.
Julie Morgan AM: It's in the process at the moment.
Suzy Davies AM: There we are. Just giving you a good warning.
Lynne Neagle AM: Sian.
Sian Gwenllian AM: How much would it cost to move to a child-centred approach, which means that every child would be able to access the childcare offer, rather than doing it from parents?
Julie Morgan AM: We are looking at that. We're having a longer-term review, in terms of what it would mean if every child had access to the childcare offer. We don't have those figures yet. We've got the one review looking at bringing in education and training. That should report early next year, and then we've got another longer-term review, looking at what a universal offer would mean.
Sian Gwenllian AM: Do we know how many children we're talking about?
Nicola Edwards: Yes. So, there are approximately, at any given time, around 73,000 three and four-year-olds in Wales. There's some slight rounding in the numbers there, but approximately 73,000 at any given time. Based on the current eligibility criteria for the offer, it's about 34,000 children, we believe, are eligible. This does, of course, vary, depending on a whole range of different factors, and we certainly know from what we're seeing from the offer that, even where people are entitled to something, they don't necessarily take it up. And even if they do take it up, they don't necessarily take up their full entitlement, which is also something that we'd have to think about in terms of any modelling on costings.
Sian Gwenllian AM: So, half the children are in non-working families.
Nicola Edwards: It's because of the requirement that, in a two-parent household, both parents must be in work.
Sian Gwenllian AM: Yes. Two parent. Okay.
Lynne Neagle AM: One of the points that the committee made very strongly in our report on the Bill was that we wanted to see a much more child-centred focus, and one of the issues that came out in scrutiny was whether, actually, three and four-year-olds were the right age to be actually targeting if we're looking at things like child development. Have you given any consideration to the actual age group that's covered when we know that, for many children, it's the first 1,000 days that makes that fundamental difference?
Julie Morgan AM: We are aware that there is a case that says that two years old is a very important time. We are looking at that as part of the overall longer review, yes. We are aware of the information and what you're saying about the younger the better.
Lynne Neagle AM: Okay, thank you. Dawn.
Dawn Bowden AM: Yes, my final question, Chair, thank you, is about the parent, childcare and employment programme, which is jointly funded by the European social fund and Welsh Government. It has been quite successful, in terms of its numbers anyway, in getting economically inactive parents into work. What are the plans for this programme, if and when we leave the EU and we lose the ESF funding for that?
Julie Morgan AM: Well, the programme has recently been extended, with delivery continuing until June 2022, with additional ESF funding of PS5. 6 million. That's recently happened, and obviously this programme provides intensive employment to parents who are not in education, employment or training or economically inactive and where the childcare is the main barrier, and it has been a very, very successful programme. So, the UK has guaranteed funding for all EU projects approved by December 2020, and this includes the PaCE programme. I think there was also another--. I only heard it verbally. I heard some other guarantees on the radio recently from the UK Treasury about guaranteeing some of these funds. I don't know whether anybody else heard that. But the Welsh Government can only draw on the UK Government guarantee for claims that aren't paid by the European Commission, and so the current arrangements are staying in place.
Dawn Bowden AM: Until when, sorry?
Julie Morgan AM: Well, June 2022.
Dawn Bowden AM: Oh, I see. Yes. So, that's when all the current commitments expire, basically. Yes. So, we don't know--. To do that it would have to be part of Government planning in terms of--
Julie Morgan AM: Well, we don't know what's happening with that--
Dawn Bowden AM: --what would happen beyond that.
Julie Morgan AM: --funding, but there have been some promises from the UK Government recently, but nothing definite.
Dawn Bowden AM: Yes, we're not holding our breath.
Julie Morgan AM: No.
Dawn Bowden AM: Okay. Thank you, Chair.
Lynne Neagle AM: Okay, thank you. Sian's got some specific questions now around the Childcare Funding (Wales) Act 2019.
Sian Gwenllian AM: As we know, of course, the work with Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs has ended, and I know you weren't the Minister who initiated this process, but what exactly has gone wrong? What are these issues that have come to light that have made you suspend that? It's very frustrating for us, as a committee, who scrutinised that extensively and raised a lot of concerns about that. And a lot of time has been spent talking about this funding Bill, and money--PS1 million, I understand--has been wasted, if you like, unnecessarily. So, what exactly has gone wrong? Why aren't you discussing these things with HMRC?
Julie Morgan AM:
Sian Gwenllian AM: Yes. So, thank you for that explanation.
Julie Morgan AM: I've got more to say as well.
Sian Gwenllian AM: Yes, but for your transparency around your particular view that it needs to be more flexible and expanded upon and, therefore, going down the HMRC route was--
Julie Morgan AM: It would have restricted us a lot.
Sian Gwenllian AM: Yes. We knew that from the beginning. I mean, that's, you know--. So, it was a principle decision rather than any sort of technical matters to do with the Welsh language standards. That's been cited as one kind of--. But I'm really understanding more now that, really, what it's about is that you want to have a more flexible, and expand on the offer and that this would curtail--going through HMRC would put limits on that.
Julie Morgan AM: That is one of the reasons, but there were issues about the Welsh language, which we can go into in detail, if you'd like. There were some issues about that. They would be able to process things bilingually, and I think that was probably told to the committee when we looked at the HMRC. But, in terms of the Welsh language standards that the Minister has to use, there would be some difficulties in them doing it.
Sian Gwenllian AM: But would you say that your main change came about because you wanted to be more flexible rather than any difficulties--
Julie Morgan AM: One of the major reasons, I think--
Sian Gwenllian AM: Okay. Good.
Julie Morgan AM: But there are--. As I say, there are other reasons. Those technical reasons probably do end up being quite important--
Sian Gwenllian AM: But the committee was told by the previous Minister that HMRC wouldn't have any problem at all with delivering according to the Welsh language standards.
Julie Morgan AM: Do you want to add something to this?
Nicola Edwards: So, in terms of some of the technical issues we had, if you want to start with the bilingual provision and the Welsh language standards, HMRC do provide a bilingual service at the moment for their customers in line with their Welsh language scheme, and I think we can all appreciate that schemes are quite different from the requirements of the standards. And there were some issues when we got into the detail of the standards that the Welsh Ministers are required to deliver to that caused some concerns in terms of how HMRC were going to do it, particularly in terms of the multiple IT systems that go into building up the childcare services. So, for example, there are a number of what are called'special characters'in the Welsh alphabet, such as the to bach, for example. The HMRC IT system has some issues with that.
Sian Gwenllian AM: Yes, well, with due respect, the to bach has always been there--
Nicola Edwards: Oh, yes, I completely agree. Unfortunately, however--
Sian Gwenllian AM: --and HMRC would have been able to tell you, really early on, you would have thought, that it was--. I don't really want to go into it, because I think we've got to the crux of why HMRC was dropped. I think it's been dropped because Julie feels that the offer needs to be more flexible, and I can understand why you would say that.
Julie Morgan AM: If we bring in training and education, for example, we wouldn't be able to do that via the HMRC, it would have to be done by the local authorities. Foster parents have to be done via the local authorities. Any people of immigration status of no resource from public funds, that would have to be done via the local authorities. And with the local authorities also wanting to do it--. I mean, there are other things with using HMRC--if any changes were made with the English offer, for example, because this would be delivered via HMRC with the English offer, that would cause difficulties for the Welsh offer. So, we wanted something more flexible. I don't know if there's anything more you want to add on that.
Jo-Anne Daniels: The only thing I'd add is that--and, again, I think the Minister has referred to this--the costs that HMRC presented us with at the end of the discovery phase were significantly higher than the costs that had initially been outlined and that we outlined to the committee in the regulatory impact assessment. So, our conclusion is that we can deliver a cheaper system and a system that has the flexibility that the Deputy Minister has referred to by working with local authorities rather than HMRC. So, there is an important issue around value for money as well and making sure that the investment that we're making into developing the national system is one that--that, in a sense, that investment stays in Wales. So, obviously, the money that we're paying over to HMRC to run the system would be supporting HMRC and their employees wherever they may be based, many of them not based in Wales; investment in local authorities to administer the system means that we're retaining more of that investment here.
Sian Gwenllian AM: Well, I congratulate you on persuading local government and WLGA to change their minds, because they actually told this committee that they favoured the HMRC option--and this is only going back a few months--because it will remove--and this is quoting them--'it will remove the administrative burden of receiving applications and checking eligibility from local authorities'-- blah, blah, blah, blah. So, they've obviously changed their minds as well, which is, you know--. I congratulate you on that, but it does present us as a committee with a little bit of a problem, really, because, if we're told one thing a few months ago and then we're told something completely different today, you know, evidence--we have to go on evidence that we've heard, and the evidence has changed now.
Julie Morgan AM: I think, during the period since it was discussed on the committee, the work with the HMRC has helped highlight to us where we needed to go. So, I think we did learn a lot and it certainly has helped show to us where we think is the best place to go. I would like to pay tribute to the local authorities, because they've been great partners in this and they're very positive about moving forward keeping the work. And there's also a feeling that, because they are so much closer to the local public than HMRC is, they're able to build up links with families and help with some of these difficult issues. Because I'm sure many of you may have had individual cases--I certainly have--where there's been quite a lot of complexity about helping people fill in the forms and look at their eligibility. So, I say well done to the local authorities. And thanks to the HMRC, because we've had nothing but a very positive relationship with them.
Lynne Neagle AM: Suzy, you've got a supplementary.
Suzy Davies AM: Thank you. Ms Daniels, you referred to value for money. How much is it actually going to cost to change this system from being a temporary arrangement with local authorities to a permanent one? And how much more is it going to cost for the more flexible system that you have in mind? They're not going to do this for nothing. How much extra are you giving them, and will they use it for this? How are you ensuring it's used for this?
Jo-Anne Daniels: So, at the moment, local--. So, two things. Just to start by saying the eligibility checking process is not undertaken by all 22 local authorities.
Suzy Davies AM: No, no, I realise that. Yes, I got all that.
Jo-Anne Daniels: So, part of the reason for using 10 is to try to ensure that we build economies of scale and that we have a more efficient operation. Those authorities that undertake that function are given a specific grant in order to do that. That grant is ring-fenced to that purpose.
Suzy Davies AM: Could you give us an idea of the price tag?
Jo-Anne Daniels: At the moment, it's about PS2. 5 million.
Suzy Davies AM: Okay, just as a round figure--that's fine.
Nicola Edwards: Just for the administration. They get separate funding for the childcare, obviously.
Suzy Davies AM: Okay, thank you.
Jo-Anne Daniels: So that, as I said, is a ring-fenced sum that they use to administer the offer. We are now starting the detailed work to define the new system requirements so that we will have a single application process across Wales, moving forward. As part of that work, we'll need to consider the detailed costings, but our initial estimate suggests that it would be less than the cost proposed by HMRC.
Suzy Davies AM: Okay, when those costings are worked up, perhaps we could have a note comparing the two figures.
Jo-Anne Daniels: Yes, we would be very happy to share more detail on that.
Suzy Davies AM: Thank you.
Lynne Neagle AM: Sian.
Sian Gwenllian AM: If it became a universal offer, would those costs reduce? Would there be so much bureaucracy involved in checking eligibility and stuff if every child was open to the offer?
Jo-Anne Daniels: So, clearly, if every child is eligible, then a large part of the process falls away in terms of the need to verify income and so on. That doesn't mean that there's no administration. For example, with the foundation phase, which is universally available, there is an application process and there is an administrative function that sits alongside that. At this point in time, I couldn't give you any indication of--
Sian Gwenllian AM: But it would be substantially less, wouldn't it, because they wouldn't have to do all these eligibility checks and all those things?
Nicola Edwards: They wouldn't have to do the eligibility checks, but they would still have to make payments to the childcare providers and make sure they were paying for the right number of hours in respect of each child. So, parents would still need to tell them where their child was going, and there would still need to be some work alongside that.
Lynne Neagle AM: Okay. Sian, do you want to ask about the Welsh language?
Sian Gwenllian AM: I think we've--. I'm happy with that.
Lynne Neagle AM: Really--?
Sian Gwenllian AM: I don't think that that was the real reason why the change happened.
Julie Morgan AM: One of the reasons.
Lynne Neagle AM: Nevertheless, the committee was given very concrete assurances that the Welsh language side of this was going to be covered off. Have you got anything that you want to add on that? Obviously, for us as a committee, we believe what we're told when we are given assurances. So, that's quite concerning for us, really, that that suddenly then became an issue, when both HMRC and the Minister at the time told us that this wasn't going to be a problem.
Nicola Edwards: So, I think it's the point that I was talking about earlier. There's a difference between a bilingual service in the context of what HMRC understood that to be, in the context of their scheme, and the very detail of the standards when they got into their IT systems.
Lynne Neagle AM: Shouldn't that have been something that was worked out at the beginning?
Nicola Edwards: Possibly, but they did need to do quite detailed work, not just into their own IT systems, but the feed-in systems from the Home Office, the Department for Work and Pensions and the Post Office as well, to understand the full complexity of how the standards would comply across all of that. They do provide a bilingual service. It was just some of the specific details of the requirements placed on the Welsh Ministers, because it is the Welsh Ministers'standards that they would need to deliver against that they were struggling with.
Lynne Neagle AM: Right, okay.
Sian Gwenllian AM: Yes, but those standards were there right from the very beginning.
Lynne Neagle AM: I think that the committee would feel that that should have been bottomed out at the beginning, really.
Sian Gwenllian AM: Nothing has changed in terms of the standards.
Lynne Neagle AM: Okay, just before we move on to Flying Start, can I just ask: the Minister mentioned a longer term review of the childcare offer. Are you able to give us any indication of when that will report, please?
Julie Morgan AM: Would we have any idea?
Nicola Edwards: We haven't set out a definitive timescale on that as of yet because we've been focusing very much on getting the review in terms of training, education and on the cusp of returning to work up and running. But sometime next year.
Lynne Neagle AM: Okay. So, it will report sometime next year.
Nicola Edwards: Yes.
Lynne Neagle AM: Okay, thank you. We'll move on now to Flying Start and questions from Suzy Davies.
Suzy Davies AM: Thank you, Chair. Can I just begin by asking you how you respond to the assertion that children from the most disadvantaged backgrounds do better in a mixed socioeconomic environment than in a targeted environment?
Julie Morgan AM: I think that's what Flying Start does, isn't it? Yes, I would have thought that was likely.
Suzy Davies AM: Well, the reason I'm asking you that, of course, is because this committee has suggested, perhaps, changes to the outreach system to target more disadvantaged children, and not necessarily capture people who happen to be in a geographic area.
Julie Morgan AM: So, you're saying that you feel that a universal offer in certain areas is not advantageous to--
Suzy Davies AM: Well, I'm asking you, really. If it's the case that we're only going after disadvantaged children, which would take very precise targeting--
Julie Morgan AM: I'm not only going after disadvantaged children. I feel that we should be offering something for all children, and our considerations are for all children. The reason we've targeted Flying Start is because it would be great if we had enough money to have Flying Start throughout the whole of Wales, but we just don't have that sort of money. Because I think Flying Start has proved to be a great--very successful.
Suzy Davies AM: I'm going to ask you a few more questions on that. Because just in response to this committee's 2018 report, you did say that:'defined geographical targeting of Flying Start support will be considered as part of the Welsh Government's work on the Early Years system.'That suggests you still have geographic targeting in mind. So, if you're looking at a very mixed source of economic experience for children, what are the geographic boundaries you're considering?
Julie Morgan AM: At the moment, Flying Start can go beyond the geographical boundaries, with the extension--
Suzy Davies AM: With limits, yes.
Julie Morgan AM: Yes. I think they can use 10 per cent of their income to go beyond the geographical boundaries, and many of them have done that. But, obviously, there are four elements to Flying Start, and only those geographical areas have got the four elements, but there could be the opportunity of extending some of that beyond the Flying Start geographical areas. We're looking at this.
Suzy Davies AM: I accept what you say about the current system--
Julie Morgan AM: I believe it's much more--. I believe very strongly in having a universal system, where everybody is able to access it.
Suzy Davies AM: I appreciate that as well. But, obviously, there are huge cost implications for that--unless you're giving us some insight into what you're going to say next week, I don't know. But actually, defining anything geographically, which now seems to be fairly arbitrary, because it's not targeted purely at disadvantaged children--on what basis are we choosing the geographic areas we are choosing at the moment?
Julie Morgan AM: Well, they're chosen then because of the benefit take-up in those particular areas. So, it's reaching some of the poorest children, but not all of the poorest children, but it's reaching the poorest children in a way that is not stigmatising, and where the services are open to everybody, and I think that's very important.
Suzy Davies AM: Okay. Well, having established that, we have fairly recent research here that a third of children living in poverty in Wales are already falling behind at the age of five--that suggests that two thirds of them aren't, but it's still a very worrying statistic. Not all children live in Flying Start areas; how are you going to reach that third who, even at such an early age, are already falling behind? How many of them are in Flying Start areas?
Julie Morgan AM: I think the actual number of children in poverty, the most disadvantaged that we reach through the Flying Start areas--I think it's about 46 per cent. Is that--? Do you know the actual percentage?
Suzy Davies AM: It's about a quarter of total children are in there, but--
Jo-Anne Daniels: So, just to give you a few of the numbers, there are just over 36,000 children benefiting from Flying Start services. That equates to about 23 per cent of children, overall, in Wales. And because of the nature of the benefit take-up data, and because we don't assess eligibility within a Flying Start area, we can't be absolutely certain how many children within a Flying Start area are actually in poverty. So, it's an estimate, and it's a range, and the range is that around 45 per cent of children in Flying Start areas would be in poverty. FootnoteLink
Suzy Davies AM: Well, that's interesting. I would have expected it to be much higher than that, particularly if the geographic areas had been targeted on benefit claims, effectively. Are you disappointed that the proportion is--basically, 55 per cent of those children aren't living in poverty. That's what you're saying, isn't it?
Jo-Anne Daniels: Well, I'd offer two observations. One: the nature of poverty in Wales is actually, generally, more dispersed than perhaps sometimes is appreciated. Yes, we have very concentrated areas of--
Suzy Davies AM: Well, actually, we do appreciate it, which is why we're asking this question. [Laughter. ]
Jo-Anne Daniels: Okay. So that's one issue to think about. Sorry, I've lost my train of thought now, in terms of the second--oh, sorry: whether you're in or out of poverty is, in one sense, very black/white. But in reality of course--in terms of the income definition, it's very black/white. But, of course, there will be a large number of people who are just above, but also families who move in and out, so it's quite a transient population in some senses, in terms of people having incomes that aren't stable, people having jobs that go with that that aren't stable. So, at any one point in time, you're only sort of capturing a snapshot of what's happening. In reality, it's a bit more complex than that.
Suzy Davies AM: I accept that. I mentioned a third of children living in poverty had fallen behind at five; by the age of 14, half that number is still falling behind, so something has happened between that third and that half to improve the life chances of those individual children or young people. Is that attributable to Flying Start? Can you say that candidly? Or is it a happy coincidence, where there could be some causation, but we can't prove it?
Jo-Anne Daniels: We certainly think that Flying Start is making a positive impact, both on the point at which children go to school, and then subsequently. And I think as the committee knows, we've been working with the SAIL--secure anonymised information linkage--and the databank there to look at how we can do longitudinal studies to track children's progress, to look at the extent to which outcomes are effected by Flying Start interventions.
Suzy Davies AM: We probably don't have time for this level of detail today, but half of those children are still behind at the age of 14. So, I'd be curious to know if there's any immediate plans to help them catch up or make sure that their successors don't fall into the same position, the same trap. Have you got anything high level that you can mention at this stage?
Julie Morgan AM: Just in terms of what we're thinking of doing with Flying Start--. The key thing about Flying Start is the collaborative way that it works with the health visitors and all the speech and language therapists and childcare, and we're looking at ways of trying to get some of those elements to reach a wider group. And as I said, we talked about earlier the eight earlier years transformation pathfinders that we talked about in the local authorities--we talked about that earlier--so, that's where we're going to look at Flying Start and how we can try to make it more accessible to more children. So, we do want to extend the benefits of Flying Start. We do want to make it available to more children, and that's what we're looking at. And we're looking at that in those eight pathfinder areas. And you'll have to wait to see what we come up with--
Suzy Davies AM: No, no--we'll ask you more about that in due course. Actually, that job would be an awful lot easier if you knew how many children within Flying Start areas were taking up all four elements. Why don't you know that? Why is that data not collected?
Julie Morgan AM: Do we know why?
Jo-Anne Daniels: So, the approach that we've taken to evaluation in Flying Start--. The committee will have seen the various evaluation reports that have been published, and I know that you're familiar with the work that, as I say, we've been doing with SAIL. We're currently focusing on individual data collection, and through that we want to be able to report on levels of engagement, but also outcomes for children. We've been piloting that new approach in six local authorities. We hope to be able to extend that, and we hope to be able to provide more evidence about the interventions and the impact that they then achieve.
Suzy Davies AM: Okay. All right. Because, to be honest, I would want to know if a child's chances have improved primarily because they're getting good-quality childcare or primarily because their parents are taking up parenting courses. There's got to be some indication somewhere in here about which of these four elements is making the greatest difference.
Jo-Anne Daniels: I would just caution in terms of expectations. It will always be quite difficult to definitively provide answers to that, because many parents will be taking these things up in combination. So, disentangling which has had the effect is, obviously, quite tricky--in particular, all parents will be getting the enhanced health visiting. Not every parent will take up parenting support, not every child will need speech and language help, so--
Suzy Davies AM: And that's why we need to know who is.
Jo-Anne Daniels: Disentangling what's helped and what hasn't I think will always be quite a difficult thing to do.
Suzy Davies AM: But it would also be helpful to know which combinations work best as well. Just on the final point from me--yes, 88 per cent of Flying Start's childcare offers were taken up, but we've had some local authorities where the take-up has dropped dramatically. I think Denbighshire was down a fair bit, wasn't it, and Ceredigion, I think, had had a poor take-up. Have you got any indication why? I'm thinking of Denbighshire particularly, where there is a tradition--taking up third-party childcare is cultural there, whereas in Ceredigion, for example, there are far fewer places available in the first place and less of a tradition of children taking up childcare. But what's happened in Denbighshire?
Julie Morgan AM: I think there are a number of different reasons why parents do decide not to use a facility, and, obviously, that always exists, but each local authority has a Flying Start account manager in place to support them in the delivery of the programme and the account management activities, and there are formal account meetings that look at this sort of thing once a year--
Suzy Davies AM: So, what have they told you?
Julie Morgan AM: --and these meetings will take place in November 2019. That's when the specific delivery issues will be discussed in depth, so that's when we'll find out what has happened and why there may have been a drop.
Suzy Davies AM: Can I just ask about the timing of that? Because if you already know that there's a 6 per cent drop, why will it take the best part of a year to--well, November's only next month, to be fair, now, but why will it take that length of time to establish why there's a drop? You'd have thought if you'd seen a trend like that--
Julie Morgan AM: Obviously, they meet at certain times and they will assess what's happened. That seems quite normal to me.
Suzy Davies AM: Okay, but we'll get a note on that, is it? It's just that they knew this six months ago.
Julie Morgan AM: In November, we'll have more information about this, so we can let you have information about that.
Suzy Davies AM: That would be really helpful, just for--. I'm sure constituents in Denbighshire will want to know about that. And then finally from me, Chair, if I may, Flying Start beneficiaries--it's got a specific explanation of what a Flying Start beneficiary is, but I think, particularly in view of the evidence we've heard on this committee about parental support in connection with the removal of the defence of reasonable chastisement, for example, this committee is very concerned about what's out there in terms of parental support. Eighteen per cent of Flying Start beneficiaries have parents attending the informal parenting courses; that's 18 per cent, that's not very high. Any idea about what you might be able to do to encourage take-up or is that very locally decided?
Lynne Neagle AM: If I can add to that, obviously, somebody only has to attend one course--we've got no way of knowing whether parents are completing the whole of a course, really.
Julie Morgan AM: Obviously, the offer is there for parents to take up the parenting courses, and there are four elements to Flying Start, and maybe some of the parents don't feel that they want to or need to. I don't think we've got any more evidence on that for take-up--
Suzy Davies AM: Well, the reach of this is going to be important, because we need the reassurance on the back of the legislation that is going through at the moment.
Julie Morgan AM: Absolutely, yes.
Jo-Anne Daniels: Parenting courses are, of course, one aspect of parenting support, but not the only one, and they'll be appropriate for a lot of parents, but for some not. What all parents do get at an enhanced level in Flying Start is the support of the health visitor, so the health visitor is, in effect, providing a significant amount of support for parenting. Now, that can be practical things like weaning or potty training et cetera, but, actually, it's also about managing a child's behaviour, managing how a parent develops that bonding and that attachment with their child. So, the role of the health visitor in supporting a parent to be a parent is absolutely critical, and every parent in Flying Start areas will be getting that enhanced level of support. Of course, it's not just in Flying Start areas now, because with the Healthy Child Wales programme, the universal programme of health visiting visits, we have a much more consistent and standardised set of visits and engagements with parents that cover a lot of these areas. In addition, I'd also add that when parents use the childcare in Flying Start, or childcare generally outside of Flying Start areas, there is often a lot of working between the childcare setting and the parent over parenting--again, managing a child's behaviour, managing any issues that the childcare worker thinks are emerging in terms of whether it's eating or, again, toileting. So, parenting courses are important, but it's really essential that we see those in the broader context of the different ways in which lots of professionals interact with parents, providing them with advice, guidance and support, and actually what works for parents in terms of how they take on board some of that advice and that help. Sometimes a formal course is quite off-putting for parents, but the sort of quiet word, the top tips, the advice that a friendly professional gives can be very, very impactful.
Suzy Davies AM: That's a really helpful answer. It does raise, unfortunately, another question about whether a health visitor in those circumstances might find themselves in a difficult position if they're dealing with a parent who has smacked a child, but we'll leave that for Stage 3.
Julie Morgan AM: We'll be dealing with that, I'm sure.
Suzy Davies AM: But thank you; that was a helpful answer. Thank you, Chair.
Lynne Neagle AM: Okay. Thank you. Are there any other questions from Members? No. Okay. Well, can I thank the Minister and the officials for attending this morning? As usual, you'll be sent a transcript to check for accuracy following the meeting, but thank you again for your attendance. Thank you.
Julie Morgan AM: Thank you very much.
Lynne Neagle AM: Okay. Item 4 is papers to note. There's just one today: the letter from the WLGA regarding the Childcare Funding (Wales) Act 2019 in response to our letter asking about the change in approach. Item 5 then. Can I propose, in accordance with Standing Order 17. 42, that the committee resolves to meet in private for the remainder of the meeting? Are Members content? Thank you.","Julie Morgan insisted that they were aware that different local authorities actually had adopted different patterns of providing early education. And with the Flying Start programme being geographically targeted, with the education being determined by the local authorities, they knew that there was a variance throughout Wales. Then they would like to see facilities developed in each local authority throughout Wales that would answer the needs of the families and the children in those areas. And It was demand-led and universally available to all parents who meet the eligibility criteria of working, so they believed the programme should be available to everybody.",qmsum
"What did Janet Finch-Saunders think of childcare when discussing differences of care provision in different parts of Wales?
Lynne Neagle AM: Good morning, everyone. Welcome to the Children, Young People and Education Committee. We've received no apologies for absence this morning. Can I ask if there are any declarations of interest from Members, please? No. Okay. Thank you. Item 3 this morning then is a scrutiny session on early childhood education and care, and I'm very pleased to welcome Julie Morgan AM, Deputy Minister for Health and Social Services; Jo-anne Daniels, director of communities and tackling poverty at Welsh Government; and Nicola Edwards, deputy director of the childcare, play and early years division in Welsh Government. Thank you all for your attendance. We're very much looking forward to the session. If you're happy, we'll go straight into questions, and the first ones are from Hefin David.
Hefin David AM: Good morning, Deputy Minister. What are your primary objectives? Is it supporting the development of children or getting parents into work?
Julie Morgan AM: Well, I think you'll be aware from the range of programmes that we've got that we do feel it's important to support both children and parents. There's obviously lots of evidence to show how important the early years are for children, how important they are for their development, and so, that is one of our primary objectives. But we also know how important it is for parents to have stable jobs, reasonably paid, so that can also help with the development of the children. So, we really see it that our plans are for both parents and children, and we believe that a high-quality, early-childhood education and care system can provide that. And, of course, in terms of when we talk about jobs as well, I think it's really important to remember that the childcare system is a big employer as well and a very important employer. So that, actually, itself provides jobs.
Hefin David AM: So, the evidence we've seen suggests that, historically, Governments in the UK and devolved have focused on primarily getting parents into work. So, are you suggesting then that your focus is to change that and move towards early child development?
Julie Morgan AM: No, what I'm saying is that we want to give parents the opportunity to work. We don't want childcare to be a barrier to parents working because we think that working is one the best routes out of poverty, but we do also want to make sure that children have the greatest experience that they can have in the early years. So, we see it as one.
Hefin David AM: Okay. And that's quite a policy challenge to deliver both at the same time.
Julie Morgan AM: The situation as it is is complex, and I think it needs simplifying. It is a challenge, but it's probably one of the most important challenges we've got in Government, because what we offer to families with young children is one of the most important things we do.
Hefin David AM: And in your evidence to the committee, you said that the Welsh Government's approach'will build on a wide variety of programmes that are continually developing in order to support parents, families and children during the early years.'And you've just said you want to simplify that. How do you simplify that, particularly with regard to the provision of funding and the way these things connect from the birth of a child into school? How will simplification look, and what will happen?
Julie Morgan AM: Well, we're not at the stage of being able to say what it will look like at the moment, but we're looking at ways of simplifying, because I think it's absolutely right, it is a very complex system, because it's grown up from all different routes. But we are having lots of pilot projects that are looking at ways of simplifying the system. We have got pathway projects in, I think it's eight local authorities, who are looking at ways of joining up the whole system. So, we are looking at that, and I absolutely except that it is very complex and we want to find ways of making it simpler and easier to understand. So, we are working with local authorities and health boards to see how we can actually work together and simplify things.
Hefin David AM: And it's good to hear that that's your objective. Can I just come back to the first thing you said:'We can't say yet what we're going to do'?
Julie Morgan AM: No.
Hefin David AM: So, when will we have a policy plan and something that we can interrogate in more detail?
Julie Morgan AM: Well, I think we are near getting to an announcement where we will be able to say what direction we're going in, and because we have had--. Some of this work has been going on for a year or so, and we're getting the results of those pathfinder projects coming in. So, when we do have all those results, we will be able to say the direction that we want to go in, and I hope we'll be able to do that very soon.
Hefin David AM: Before Christmas?
Julie Morgan AM: I hope so.
Hefin David AM: Okay. And finally from me--
Julie Morgan AM: I'm sorry I can't say too much about that because we haven't actually--. We need to--.
Hefin David AM: Well, it does sound like something is imminent.
Julie Morgan AM: Yes.
Hefin David AM: Okay. And that's as far as you're willing to go. And if that's as far as you're willing to go, then I'll stop asking.
Lynne Neagle AM: I've got a supplementary from Sian.
Hefin David AM: Okay.
Julie Morgan AM: Yes, that's fine.
Sian Gwenllian AM: I just want to understand a little about the pilot, the pathfinders in eight local authority areas. Is the focus there on the child or is it on parents returning to work?
Julie Morgan AM: The focus is on an early years system, but we've worked both locally and nationally. So, it's looking at both. I mean, actually, I think, perhaps, Nicola, would you like to or one of you like to describe one of the programmes?
Sian Gwenllian AM: And can you just explain the vision? Is it a child-centred early years provision that we're thinking of in these pathfinder--?
Jo-Anne Daniels: So, in'Prosperity for All', we set out that early years was one of the key priority areas, and within that we said that we wanted to create a more joined-up and more responsive system. So, when we talk about a system, we're talking about the services that are provided by health boards, so health visiting, midwifery, speech and language support, other kinds of therapeutic services, as well as all the important services that local authorities are providing, such as support for parenting, advice and guidance, employment support and childcare, obviously. And we've got eight pathfinders. I'll try and remember each of them. So, Flintshire, Newport, Blaenau Gwent, Neath Port Talbot, Swansea, Ceredigion, Pembrokeshire--and then I've missed one, I think, because I've only got to seven--who have been working with us to look at how all of those services are currently delivered in their local area and whether and how they can reorganise those services to improve accessibility, to improve take-up, but essentially to improve the efficacy of those programmes in terms of supporting children, but often, obviously, in supporting children you have to support parents too and support the home.
Sian Gwenllian AM: So, would you say it's a child-centred approach?
Jo-Anne Daniels: Absolutely, because it's about making sure that we deliver the best start in life for children in Wales, but obviously parents are a critical element of that, so can't be excluded.
Lynne Neagle AM: And how long have they been going for?
Jo-Anne Daniels: So, those eight pathfinders started their work in--I think it was--February this year. And they're still in the very early stages in terms of actually unpicking and mapping the current provision of services across their areas and then moving on to the stage where they'll develop proposals for how they might change the delivery of early years.
Lynne Neagle AM: Okay, thank you. Julie.
Julie Morgan AM: Just to say also, the one in Flintshire is also testing the impact of consistent funding rates for education and childcare. So, that's been going longer than the others. So, that's another important area because there's an evaluation of that project under way at the moment.
Lynne Neagle AM: Thank you.
Jo-Anne Daniels: Sorry, but Caerphilly was the one that I forgot to mention.
Lynne Neagle AM: Oh dear. [Laughter. ]
Hefin David AM: That's absolutely unforgivable. [Laughter. ]
Lynne Neagle AM: Hefin. [Laughter. ]
Julie Morgan AM: Very significant.
Hefin David AM: In your report, the'Alignment of the Childcare Offer for Wales to the Foundation Phase', one of the recommendations was that'The Welsh Government, local authority education and childcare policy and delivery teams could merge'. So, looking behind the scenes, those disparate parts of policy, delivering the foundation phase and childcare offer should merge. Is that the case? Has that been put under way and should we be looking at this structure in more depth?
Julie Morgan AM: Well, probably not at the structure at this time because the report that you're referring to was looking at the first year of the delivery of the childcare offer and it did make a number of points, which we have taken on board. For example, we issued guidance last year regarding the delivery of the foundation phase, which supports widening the number of non-maintained settings that are able to deliver early education and we're also supporting co-location and partnership working between education and childcare providers through our capital investment programme. I think it's about PS81 million that we put into the capital investment where we are developing childcare facilities co-located with the education facilities, because that was one of the things that came out from this report you're referring to. And, I mean, obviously, early years is one of the key priorities within'Prosperity for All'and, obviously, education sits within one portfolio with the Minister for Education, and childcare is with me. But we're doing what we can to work together to try to bring those together, and that was one of the proposals in that report. But it's still very early to think about, at this stage, a structural change.
Hefin David AM: And I remember when you were on the committee here with me, sitting next to me, we had those discussions about co-location. I know the problem with not having co-location is that you could end up seeing a child travelling between three or more locations during the course of a day. Are you suggesting now that the actions you're taking will resolve that issue universally, or will it lead to a piecemeal resolution? And, if so, to what extent, what percentage of children will see that resolved as an issue?
Julie Morgan AM: Certainly, the co-location is not going to solve it universally because although we've been able to develop a lot of new facilities, or build on old facilities, there will be a lot of areas that we won't have covered. So, I can't say that there's going to be a situation where everything is going to be co-located because I don't think that would be feasible, and, for some of the providers, they wouldn't be in a position to move to a school. But ideally it's a good situation, but, certainly, I think the discussions that there were on the committee, it's not ideal to take children for long distances between different providers, let alone the effect it has on the climate change issue. It's whether it's good for children as well. So, I can't say that they will ever be co-located, but as I said in response to your earlier question, we are encouraging the development of the foundation phase in non-maintained settings, which, obviously, is quite significant.
Lynne Neagle AM: Okay. Thank you. I've got some questions now from Janet Finch-Saunders.
Janet Finch-Saunders AM: Thank you, Chair. What is the Welsh Government doing to address the big differences in the amount of early childhood education and care provision available in different parts of Wales?
Julie Morgan AM: Right. Well, thank you very much for that question. I mean, obviously, it would be good to see a greater degree of consistency, but I think it's important to acknowledge that there are reasons for that variation. Now, early education, of course, is the responsibility of the Minister for Education, and we are aware that different local authorities have adopted different patterns of providing early education. For example, local authorities are funded to provide 10 hours minimum of the foundation phase for three and four-year-olds across Wales, but there's quite a variance in how much is actually provided, with some local authorities providing a lot more historically. So, it does mean that there is a different pattern across Wales, according to what local authorities do. But what I could say is, of course, the quality is very good, as the Estyn reports have shown; that the quality provided, the delivery of the foundation phase, is very good. But it does vary in terms of what is offered throughout Wales, and that is the decision of the local authorities, and it is a historical thing. I refer to this pilot in Flint, which is trying to test paying the same rate for foundation phase and childcare. We're going to have an independent evaluation on that soon, in November this year, so that will help us. Obviously, I think local authorities'role in all this is absolutely crucial because they are the local, nearest people to decide how things develop in their own areas. And then, of course, we've got Flying Start, which is geographically targeted, which uses the data from income benefit to decide which are the areas where that is being delivered. And that is delivered where the highest proportion of children aged nought to three are living in income-dependent households. So, again, that determines the pattern throughout Wales. With Flying Start being geographically targeted, with the education being determined by the local authorities about how much there is, we know that there is a variance throughout Wales. We'd like to see facilities developed in each local authority throughout Wales that would answer the needs of the families and the children in those areas.
Lynne Neagle AM: Before you move on, Janet, Sian's got a supplementary.
Sian Gwenllian AM: Just in terms of the foundation phase, there have been cuts, of course, in expenditure in that phase. How concerned are you about that and the impact that that will have on the way in which the foundation phase is taught in our schools? The foundation phase is now part of the education improvement grant, which has seen a reduction of 10 per cent, and it has to compete against other expenditure streams within that greater pot of funding. So, are you concerned that money is being lost and that that will have an impact on standards in the foundation phase?
Julie Morgan AM: I haven't seen any evidence. Obviously, I must reiterate the foundation phase does come under the Minister for Education, but I haven't seen any evidence of any standards being lowered, and the reports from Estyn are very good. In fact, I think the foundation phase is one of our great joys, that we absolutely celebrate it, and so I'd be very concerned if I thought there was any drop in standards in the foundation phase, and I certainly haven't had any evidence of that. I would want to guard against that.
Sian Gwenllian AM: Exactly, but if there are fewer teaching assistants in the system because of the cuts, it's going to impact on standards, at the end of the day.
Julie Morgan AM: I think we have to be very careful to see that lower standards are not implemented, because it was groundbreaking when we brought it in, and it has proved to be a great success, so we want to make sure that's guarded.
Lynne Neagle AM: Thank you. Janet.
Janet Finch-Saunders AM: Going back to my original question about the big differences in amounts of early childhood education and care provision in different parts of Wales, the Welsh and UK Governments have followed a demand-driven approach to the childcare market, with subsidies mainly given to working parents. Is that a mistake? Should it be more universally available?
Julie Morgan AM: Well, some of our provision is universally available in certain areas. For example, the Flying Start provision is universally available in geographically defined areas, and I think that's very important, because that does mean that there isn't stigma, and so, in those areas, everybody can take advantage of it, and yet it is reaching those who are most in need because it's reaching those areas. So, I think that there is a purpose behind that. In terms of when you say demand led, could you elaborate on that?
Janet Finch-Saunders AM: I know that--we've just had a useful briefing from David Dallimore, and, basically, there is this theory that there are too many resources--the demand-driven approach is based more on certain factors: geographic spread in terms of it being more universal, and whether that's the right way. How do children then mix with peers from different backgrounds, in their own peer or age group?
Julie Morgan AM: It is demand--
Nicola Edwards: [Inaudible. ]--because the offer is targeted at working parents--
Janet Finch-Saunders AM: Yes, yes.
Nicola Edwards: --obviously, then the amount of availability is based on how many parents apply for it and take it up. Is that the context of demand led in that--
Janet Finch-Saunders AM: Yes.
Nicola Edwards: Right, okay.
Julie Morgan AM: It is universally available to all parents who meet the eligibility criteria of working, and I think what you're saying is that it should be available to everybody.
Lynne Neagle AM: I think the point that Janet's making is that some areas have traditionally got more childcare anyway because they have traditionally had more demand in those areas, so there's not a level playing field to start from. Is that correct?
Janet Finch-Saunders AM: Yes.
Julie Morgan AM: I think that, historically, that is definitely true, and when you look at the take-up of the childcare offer, it's certainly taken up in some areas with a very high take-up rate. I think Ynys Mon was nearly 90 per cent or something--
Sian Gwenllian AM: They need more money, because they haven't got enough funding.
Dawn Bowden AM: So does everywhere.
Sian Gwenllian AM: No, to meet the demand.
Julie Morgan AM: In other areas, it's much, much lower--in some of the cities, I know. So, there is a big range in take-up--
Janet Finch-Saunders AM: So, do you intend to bring something forward to address that?
Julie Morgan AM: We are planning to extend it. We're looking at the possibility of extending it to parents who are in education and training. So, we are widening the offer, yes. Obviously, we have to wait for the evaluation of that. It would be great to be able to offer it to absolutely everybody, but obviously we have got the finance to look at in terms of how we do that. But we are certainly planning to expand it.
Lynne Neagle AM: We've got questions on the offer in a little while. Janet.
Janet Finch-Saunders AM: Does the Welsh Government intend to develop an integrated approach, then, against all settings? If so, given the current inconsistencies, how can quality be assured?
Julie Morgan AM: We are developing a more integrated approach towards the early years. As I've said, we're trying to have the foundation phase operating in more non-maintained settings, and we're already developing that. But Estyn and CIW will continue to inspect and regulate the early years sector to ensure standards, and, since January 2019, CIW and Estyn have moved to joint inspections for the non-maintained settings that are offering the foundation phase. So, that is a very positive move, I think, and is absolutely making sure that standards are maintained, because if we are having the foundation phase in non-maintained settings, that is a challenge where we want to be sure that the standards and the philosophy of the foundation phase are maintained. So, we have got the system of inspection to ensure that.
Janet Finch-Saunders AM: And finally from me, what specific steps have been put in place to take forward the commitments from the Welsh Government's 2017 childcare/play early years workforce plan to build a better understanding of the workforce's Welsh language skills to enable support for the sector to be targeted and to identify where capacity needs to be built for the future to meet the needs of the early years sector in a bilingual Wales?
Julie Morgan AM: We think this is very important, and we're pleased that 29 per cent of children taking up the childcare offer are in Welsh or bilingual settings, so we think that's very good. We have established a specific programme to develop Welsh language skills in the childcare and play workforce with the National Centre for Learning Welsh, to develop workplace Welsh language skills across the sector. So, we're actually working with that, and I think you've done something with those recently, haven't you? I don't know if you want to--
Nicola Edwards: Yes. So, we have a stakeholder group where we've brought together a variety of people with an interest in the early years, childcare and play sectors, and we had a presentation just last month from the national language centre about the education programmes that they're rolling out, and how this is all coming together, which is quite interesting. We've been working quite carefully to make sure that the variety of work-based learning programmes that we provide and offer are also available in Welsh and bilingually. Recruitment and retention within the childcare and play sector is quite challenging in any case. Recruiting and retaining staff with really good Welsh language skills adds an extra dimension to it, and that it's a point that Mudiad Meithrin makes to us quite regularly, that they do struggle to find staff with the right skills. So, upskilling the existing workforce is a key part of it, but also doing more to attract people in with Welsh language skills in the first place in terms of the training courses that we're taking forward, and thinking about that in the context of the targets within Cymraeg 2050 and the aim to get to one million Welsh speakers. So, as the Deputy Minister said, we've got quite a number of children accessing the offer in Welsh-medium or bilingual settings at the moment. We're going to be doing some baselining work against that in terms of local authorities'Welsh in education strategic plans and education places, and what we can then do to increase the number of childcare places in parallel with that so that you can make sure that you start that pathway through learning Welsh, interacting with education and childcare through Welsh at a much earlier stage.
Lynne Neagle AM: Suzy, you've got a supplementary.
Suzy Davies AM: Just on this early point, anybody who's been through the Welsh education system, which is 20 years now, will have some Welsh language skills, obviously to differing degrees. For the entrants that are coming into childcare training now, there are going to be very few of them, realistically, with no Welsh at all, so what's actually being incorporated into the early years care training to make sure, at that stage, that the Welsh language skills are being developed, as opposed to an add-on later on?
Nicola Edwards: You're quite right. Most people coming through the education system will have some awareness of Welsh although I think it's probably important to remember we do also employ people from outside of wales.
Suzy Davies AM: Yes, but the majority, being realistic.
Nicola Edwards: But they don't necessarily have Welsh that is appropriate. They've got Welsh that they've developed in school. It's not necessarily appropriate for then teaching that language to children, who may be coming from families who don't use Welsh at home. So, that might be the first interaction that child has with the language. So, there's a lot of that in terms of child development and how you develop children bilingually, particularly if they're coming from English-medium homes, and reinforcing the language in language choices. There will also be some people who are, perhaps--we see this quite a lot in the office--quite confident in terms of speaking Welsh but less so in terms of some of the paperwork, the reporting, the writing and the interacting with parents more officially, which we need to think about as well. But it is mainly about getting people to a point where they can transmit that language onwards in a confident and meaningful way.
Suzy Davies AM: Okay. And it's ingrained in the early years training.
Nicola Edwards: Yes.
Suzy Davies AM: Okay. That's fine. Thank you for that. Thank you, Chair.
Lynne Neagle AM: Just before we move on, you said that 29 per cent of the take-up of the childcare offer is either through Welsh or is bilingual. Have you got any figures about how many children are accessing it in Welsh only?
Nicola Edwards: We will have. It becomes--. With the way we do it, it's because of the way that the setting defines their language category, and that's how we collect it. We do go down to individual child level, although it's anonymised, data collection on a termly basis. So I'll have a look and see if we can send you through the last term.
Lynne Neagle AM: Maybe if the committee could have a note, that would be really useful.
Nicola Edwards: Yes, that's fine.
Lynne Neagle AM: We've got some questions now on childcare from Dawn Bowden.
Dawn Bowden AM: Thank you, Chair. Deputy Minister, the evaluation of the childcare offer, when it was published last year, said that there was very little evidence currently available to determine what its impact was. You're going to be producing a second evaluation in November this year; do you expect to see some indications now of the impact?
Julie Morgan AM: Well, the evaluation of the first year of the childcare offer was very limited, because the childcare offer wasn't available throughout the whole of Wales. And it was a very early implementation phase. So, obviously it takes time to grow. And the evaluation for year 2, I think, will also show a limited impact for the same reasons. The offer became available across the whole of Wales only last April. So we've only got since last April that it's actually been fully available. And the parental survey was released to parents in June 2019, therefore any impact on parents in the authorities coming on board in the second year will also be negligible. So, it's from the next one, however, we hope that we will get more information.
Dawn Bowden AM: So you think, by the time we get to November 2020, you might have a better picture.
Julie Morgan AM: The evaluation will be more meaningful, we think, then, yes.
Dawn Bowden AM: Okay. I take that point. What the first year's evaluation did show, however, was that 94 per cent of respondents said that they were already using formal childcare before the offer came into place. A couple of things, really: are you surprised at that, and is that likely to inform the way that you develop the offer in the future?
Julie Morgan AM: No, I'm not surprised at all. When it started off, it was only available in seven local authorities. In terms of how the families found out that it was available, they found it out through the childcare providers, where they already had their children there. So it was absolutely what we would have expected, and that will continue. But, of course, we were not able to fully advertise the childcare offer until it was available in all the local authorities, which was last April. So we are planning, this autumn, quite a big push now to try to make it available to everybody--so everybody knows about it. So, no, this is the pattern we would have expected, and I think anybody who's involved in starting up something in childcare will know you have to wait a number of years before you actually see it being fully taken up.
Dawn Bowden AM: I guess the question that it raises in my mind is: does this mean that, actually, it hasn't been an incentive to get somebody back into work, because they were already in work and already had childcare provision? What you've done is you've directed money to people who were already spending that money anyway. So it hasn't been a move towards getting people into work because they couldn't afford childcare.
Julie Morgan AM: Well I think that that is something that we are moving towards, because the take-up of the offer is actually increasing each month, which is why I call it a great success. At the end of July, we hit almost 16,000 children accessing the offer, which obviously means that there are 16,000 families benefiting from this, and the feedback that we have had from parents is that they have been able to--. They've got more money available, which is obvious, which is great, because obviously more money is available to plunge into the economy and carry out that sort of thing, and we've got examples of parents who've been supported into work through programmes like Parents, Childcare and Employment to begin with, and then have gone on to access the offer. So, that's again a progression. So, I think we are seeing signs that people are moving on, have got more ability to be flexible in the work that they're doing, but I hope that when we look at it again, we will be able to see people actually moving into work because of having the access to childcare.
Dawn Bowden AM: Okay. Before--
Lynne Neagle AM: Are you going to move on? Sian's got a supplementary.
Sian Gwenllian AM: Just a question on funding for the childcare offer. If you foresee that there's going to be more people going to be taking up that offer through the fact that you're marketing it more, what if the same situation arises that has happened on Anglesey? The take-up has been very good there, but the money that the Welsh Government has been allocating to Anglesey doesn't match that. What if it happens in every local authority right across Wales? Are you confident there's going to be plenty of money available to respond to that demand?
Julie Morgan AM: Based on the current levels of take-up and looking at the rates of increase each month, we expect to spend in the region of PS50 million to PS55 million in this financial year. Our published plans already include the provision of PS40 million, and we're absolutely committed to making available the total funding that is needed to deliver on the offer. It is fantastic to see the offer being so well received on Ynys Mon, recognising, as Janet said earlier, it is demand led. We are managing it within the normal budgetary process. Local authorities will get the full funding that is needed. It's this year now that the big increase has happened; the previous two years--
Sian Gwenllian AM: So, local authorities won't have to find the extra money out of their own pots.
Julie Morgan AM: No, absolutely not. This is funded by the Welsh Government.
Sian Gwenllian AM: Yes. You can assure them.
Lynne Neagle AM: Dawn.
Dawn Bowden AM: Thank you, Chair. You've already alluded to this in answer to Janet earlier on, about extending the childcare offer to those in training and education. You also talk about'on the cusp'of returning to work. So, I'm not quite sure what'on the cusp'of returning to work is, but from the committee's point of view, we're very pleased that you've reached that conclusion, because it was one of the recommendations that we had following the scrutiny of the Bill. So, can you say a little more about that, bearing in mind that I'm also conscious that you've told Hefin you're going to be making an announcement shortly? So you may not be able to say too much. But a little bit more about the inclusion of parents in training and education, what'on the cusp of returning to work'is--what that means from your perspective--and how you've arrived at that decision now, six months into the programme. What is it that's made you move towards that conclusion?
Julie Morgan AM: Well, obviously, the children and young persons committee made a very good case for education and training, in particular; I think that was one of the things that was at the top of the list. What we've committed to do is to review the programme, particularly looking at how we could bring in education and training, and that review will report early next year. So, early next year, we will have a view on how we could go forward. But the other thing that's also happened is that, obviously, with the new First Minister, that was one of his manifesto commitments--that he would bring education and training in. So, we're obviously following the--
Dawn Bowden AM: Because that was one of the key drivers for that as well.
Julie Morgan AM: Yes, so that is another of the key drivers, as you said--the committee and what the First Minister said. There are a wealth of programmes supporting parents into education, training or work, and many of those do provide support with childcare costs. But we have, by rolling out this programme, the childcare programme, highlighted some gaps where people have felt that they, particularly people who are in full-time education--and I can think of a number of people who are actually doing PhD studies--who are--the letters may have come in from some of your constituents--not able to access the offer as things stand. So, we are looking at people who are in full-time education and training. We're using the definition by the Office for National Statistics, aren't we, in terms of education and training. And on'on the cusp of work', maybe that will have to be something we have to look at differently--those people who are actually maybe undertaking very short training programmes, preparation for work, maybe actually having interviews, where they need help with childcare, that they're sort of almost there. So, they may have to be dealt with in a different way, but I think we do want to look at those. This is expanding the offer; it's not making it universal, but it's moving on.
Dawn Bowden AM: So, what are the--? Overall, then, what are the factors that you're having to take into account? Is it going to be what is needed in order to encourage people back into work? Is it going to be cost? Is it going to be a combination of all of those things? What are going to be the key factors that you're going to be looking at?
Julie Morgan AM: Well, the position now is that anybody who fulfills the criteria in terms of the number of hours they work, we would look at that in terms of education and training, and then, this expression'on the cusp of work'we may have to look at differently, because they may not fulfil those numbers in terms of number of hours training. So, we'll get a criteria, and then they will have access to the childcare offer. But I just have to emphasise that there are ways of getting help with childcare already, and we wanted to make sure we don't duplicate. That's why this field is so complex, shall we say, because there's so many different ways that you can actually get help, and we want to be sure that we don't duplicate--
Dawn Bowden AM: Sorry, Julie. So, all of this is going to be incorporated in this announcement that you're going to be making shortly--
Julie Morgan AM: No, this review will report early next year.
Dawn Bowden AM: Okay. My final question--
Lynne Neagle AM: Before you move on, sorry, I've got a couple of supplementaries. I've got Suzy, then Sian. Sorry, Dawn.
Suzy Davies AM: Just on the cost element, because if you do roll out this programme, obviously, on the back of evidence through a review, it is going to cost extra money. Early years is one of the eight priority areas for Government. There are fairly generous Barnett consequentials coming from the comprehensive spending review and announcements on schools from the UK Government, and while I accept that you've only got annual commitments there, they're still substantial. How much money have you managed to secure for early years from the most recent announcement, and when have you planned to actually use that, maybe for some of this work?
Julie Morgan AM: Have you got some information on that?
Nicola Edwards: The budget process is ongoing internally, so I think'secured'is probably a slightly premature phrase.
Suzy Davies AM: Am I allowed to ask instead how much you've asked for, then? All I'm after is some reassurance that you will be getting some of this money, and as it is one of the eight priorities, certainly we would expect to see you getting a substantial amount of money for early years.
Julie Morgan AM: As one of the Government's priorities, we would expect to get any money that came as a result of any Barnett consequentials.
Suzy Davies AM: Okay. And it will be in the draft budget that we know for sure if it is successful.
Julie Morgan AM: It's all in the process--
Lynne Neagle AM: And the committee will want to look very carefully at that, obviously.
Julie Morgan AM: It's in the process at the moment.
Suzy Davies AM: There we are. Just giving you a good warning.
Lynne Neagle AM: Sian.
Sian Gwenllian AM: How much would it cost to move to a child-centred approach, which means that every child would be able to access the childcare offer, rather than doing it from parents?
Julie Morgan AM: We are looking at that. We're having a longer-term review, in terms of what it would mean if every child had access to the childcare offer. We don't have those figures yet. We've got the one review looking at bringing in education and training. That should report early next year, and then we've got another longer-term review, looking at what a universal offer would mean.
Sian Gwenllian AM: Do we know how many children we're talking about?
Nicola Edwards: Yes. So, there are approximately, at any given time, around 73,000 three and four-year-olds in Wales. There's some slight rounding in the numbers there, but approximately 73,000 at any given time. Based on the current eligibility criteria for the offer, it's about 34,000 children, we believe, are eligible. This does, of course, vary, depending on a whole range of different factors, and we certainly know from what we're seeing from the offer that, even where people are entitled to something, they don't necessarily take it up. And even if they do take it up, they don't necessarily take up their full entitlement, which is also something that we'd have to think about in terms of any modelling on costings.
Sian Gwenllian AM: So, half the children are in non-working families.
Nicola Edwards: It's because of the requirement that, in a two-parent household, both parents must be in work.
Sian Gwenllian AM: Yes. Two parent. Okay.
Lynne Neagle AM: One of the points that the committee made very strongly in our report on the Bill was that we wanted to see a much more child-centred focus, and one of the issues that came out in scrutiny was whether, actually, three and four-year-olds were the right age to be actually targeting if we're looking at things like child development. Have you given any consideration to the actual age group that's covered when we know that, for many children, it's the first 1,000 days that makes that fundamental difference?
Julie Morgan AM: We are aware that there is a case that says that two years old is a very important time. We are looking at that as part of the overall longer review, yes. We are aware of the information and what you're saying about the younger the better.
Lynne Neagle AM: Okay, thank you. Dawn.
Dawn Bowden AM: Yes, my final question, Chair, thank you, is about the parent, childcare and employment programme, which is jointly funded by the European social fund and Welsh Government. It has been quite successful, in terms of its numbers anyway, in getting economically inactive parents into work. What are the plans for this programme, if and when we leave the EU and we lose the ESF funding for that?
Julie Morgan AM: Well, the programme has recently been extended, with delivery continuing until June 2022, with additional ESF funding of PS5. 6 million. That's recently happened, and obviously this programme provides intensive employment to parents who are not in education, employment or training or economically inactive and where the childcare is the main barrier, and it has been a very, very successful programme. So, the UK has guaranteed funding for all EU projects approved by December 2020, and this includes the PaCE programme. I think there was also another--. I only heard it verbally. I heard some other guarantees on the radio recently from the UK Treasury about guaranteeing some of these funds. I don't know whether anybody else heard that. But the Welsh Government can only draw on the UK Government guarantee for claims that aren't paid by the European Commission, and so the current arrangements are staying in place.
Dawn Bowden AM: Until when, sorry?
Julie Morgan AM: Well, June 2022.
Dawn Bowden AM: Oh, I see. Yes. So, that's when all the current commitments expire, basically. Yes. So, we don't know--. To do that it would have to be part of Government planning in terms of--
Julie Morgan AM: Well, we don't know what's happening with that--
Dawn Bowden AM: --what would happen beyond that.
Julie Morgan AM: --funding, but there have been some promises from the UK Government recently, but nothing definite.
Dawn Bowden AM: Yes, we're not holding our breath.
Julie Morgan AM: No.
Dawn Bowden AM: Okay. Thank you, Chair.
Lynne Neagle AM: Okay, thank you. Sian's got some specific questions now around the Childcare Funding (Wales) Act 2019.
Sian Gwenllian AM: As we know, of course, the work with Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs has ended, and I know you weren't the Minister who initiated this process, but what exactly has gone wrong? What are these issues that have come to light that have made you suspend that? It's very frustrating for us, as a committee, who scrutinised that extensively and raised a lot of concerns about that. And a lot of time has been spent talking about this funding Bill, and money--PS1 million, I understand--has been wasted, if you like, unnecessarily. So, what exactly has gone wrong? Why aren't you discussing these things with HMRC?
Julie Morgan AM:
Sian Gwenllian AM: Yes. So, thank you for that explanation.
Julie Morgan AM: I've got more to say as well.
Sian Gwenllian AM: Yes, but for your transparency around your particular view that it needs to be more flexible and expanded upon and, therefore, going down the HMRC route was--
Julie Morgan AM: It would have restricted us a lot.
Sian Gwenllian AM: Yes. We knew that from the beginning. I mean, that's, you know--. So, it was a principle decision rather than any sort of technical matters to do with the Welsh language standards. That's been cited as one kind of--. But I'm really understanding more now that, really, what it's about is that you want to have a more flexible, and expand on the offer and that this would curtail--going through HMRC would put limits on that.
Julie Morgan AM: That is one of the reasons, but there were issues about the Welsh language, which we can go into in detail, if you'd like. There were some issues about that. They would be able to process things bilingually, and I think that was probably told to the committee when we looked at the HMRC. But, in terms of the Welsh language standards that the Minister has to use, there would be some difficulties in them doing it.
Sian Gwenllian AM: But would you say that your main change came about because you wanted to be more flexible rather than any difficulties--
Julie Morgan AM: One of the major reasons, I think--
Sian Gwenllian AM: Okay. Good.
Julie Morgan AM: But there are--. As I say, there are other reasons. Those technical reasons probably do end up being quite important--
Sian Gwenllian AM: But the committee was told by the previous Minister that HMRC wouldn't have any problem at all with delivering according to the Welsh language standards.
Julie Morgan AM: Do you want to add something to this?
Nicola Edwards: So, in terms of some of the technical issues we had, if you want to start with the bilingual provision and the Welsh language standards, HMRC do provide a bilingual service at the moment for their customers in line with their Welsh language scheme, and I think we can all appreciate that schemes are quite different from the requirements of the standards. And there were some issues when we got into the detail of the standards that the Welsh Ministers are required to deliver to that caused some concerns in terms of how HMRC were going to do it, particularly in terms of the multiple IT systems that go into building up the childcare services. So, for example, there are a number of what are called'special characters'in the Welsh alphabet, such as the to bach, for example. The HMRC IT system has some issues with that.
Sian Gwenllian AM: Yes, well, with due respect, the to bach has always been there--
Nicola Edwards: Oh, yes, I completely agree. Unfortunately, however--
Sian Gwenllian AM: --and HMRC would have been able to tell you, really early on, you would have thought, that it was--. I don't really want to go into it, because I think we've got to the crux of why HMRC was dropped. I think it's been dropped because Julie feels that the offer needs to be more flexible, and I can understand why you would say that.
Julie Morgan AM: If we bring in training and education, for example, we wouldn't be able to do that via the HMRC, it would have to be done by the local authorities. Foster parents have to be done via the local authorities. Any people of immigration status of no resource from public funds, that would have to be done via the local authorities. And with the local authorities also wanting to do it--. I mean, there are other things with using HMRC--if any changes were made with the English offer, for example, because this would be delivered via HMRC with the English offer, that would cause difficulties for the Welsh offer. So, we wanted something more flexible. I don't know if there's anything more you want to add on that.
Jo-Anne Daniels: The only thing I'd add is that--and, again, I think the Minister has referred to this--the costs that HMRC presented us with at the end of the discovery phase were significantly higher than the costs that had initially been outlined and that we outlined to the committee in the regulatory impact assessment. So, our conclusion is that we can deliver a cheaper system and a system that has the flexibility that the Deputy Minister has referred to by working with local authorities rather than HMRC. So, there is an important issue around value for money as well and making sure that the investment that we're making into developing the national system is one that--that, in a sense, that investment stays in Wales. So, obviously, the money that we're paying over to HMRC to run the system would be supporting HMRC and their employees wherever they may be based, many of them not based in Wales; investment in local authorities to administer the system means that we're retaining more of that investment here.
Sian Gwenllian AM: Well, I congratulate you on persuading local government and WLGA to change their minds, because they actually told this committee that they favoured the HMRC option--and this is only going back a few months--because it will remove--and this is quoting them--'it will remove the administrative burden of receiving applications and checking eligibility from local authorities'-- blah, blah, blah, blah. So, they've obviously changed their minds as well, which is, you know--. I congratulate you on that, but it does present us as a committee with a little bit of a problem, really, because, if we're told one thing a few months ago and then we're told something completely different today, you know, evidence--we have to go on evidence that we've heard, and the evidence has changed now.
Julie Morgan AM: I think, during the period since it was discussed on the committee, the work with the HMRC has helped highlight to us where we needed to go. So, I think we did learn a lot and it certainly has helped show to us where we think is the best place to go. I would like to pay tribute to the local authorities, because they've been great partners in this and they're very positive about moving forward keeping the work. And there's also a feeling that, because they are so much closer to the local public than HMRC is, they're able to build up links with families and help with some of these difficult issues. Because I'm sure many of you may have had individual cases--I certainly have--where there's been quite a lot of complexity about helping people fill in the forms and look at their eligibility. So, I say well done to the local authorities. And thanks to the HMRC, because we've had nothing but a very positive relationship with them.
Lynne Neagle AM: Suzy, you've got a supplementary.
Suzy Davies AM: Thank you. Ms Daniels, you referred to value for money. How much is it actually going to cost to change this system from being a temporary arrangement with local authorities to a permanent one? And how much more is it going to cost for the more flexible system that you have in mind? They're not going to do this for nothing. How much extra are you giving them, and will they use it for this? How are you ensuring it's used for this?
Jo-Anne Daniels: So, at the moment, local--. So, two things. Just to start by saying the eligibility checking process is not undertaken by all 22 local authorities.
Suzy Davies AM: No, no, I realise that. Yes, I got all that.
Jo-Anne Daniels: So, part of the reason for using 10 is to try to ensure that we build economies of scale and that we have a more efficient operation. Those authorities that undertake that function are given a specific grant in order to do that. That grant is ring-fenced to that purpose.
Suzy Davies AM: Could you give us an idea of the price tag?
Jo-Anne Daniels: At the moment, it's about PS2. 5 million.
Suzy Davies AM: Okay, just as a round figure--that's fine.
Nicola Edwards: Just for the administration. They get separate funding for the childcare, obviously.
Suzy Davies AM: Okay, thank you.
Jo-Anne Daniels: So that, as I said, is a ring-fenced sum that they use to administer the offer. We are now starting the detailed work to define the new system requirements so that we will have a single application process across Wales, moving forward. As part of that work, we'll need to consider the detailed costings, but our initial estimate suggests that it would be less than the cost proposed by HMRC.
Suzy Davies AM: Okay, when those costings are worked up, perhaps we could have a note comparing the two figures.
Jo-Anne Daniels: Yes, we would be very happy to share more detail on that.
Suzy Davies AM: Thank you.
Lynne Neagle AM: Sian.
Sian Gwenllian AM: If it became a universal offer, would those costs reduce? Would there be so much bureaucracy involved in checking eligibility and stuff if every child was open to the offer?
Jo-Anne Daniels: So, clearly, if every child is eligible, then a large part of the process falls away in terms of the need to verify income and so on. That doesn't mean that there's no administration. For example, with the foundation phase, which is universally available, there is an application process and there is an administrative function that sits alongside that. At this point in time, I couldn't give you any indication of--
Sian Gwenllian AM: But it would be substantially less, wouldn't it, because they wouldn't have to do all these eligibility checks and all those things?
Nicola Edwards: They wouldn't have to do the eligibility checks, but they would still have to make payments to the childcare providers and make sure they were paying for the right number of hours in respect of each child. So, parents would still need to tell them where their child was going, and there would still need to be some work alongside that.
Lynne Neagle AM: Okay. Sian, do you want to ask about the Welsh language?
Sian Gwenllian AM: I think we've--. I'm happy with that.
Lynne Neagle AM: Really--?
Sian Gwenllian AM: I don't think that that was the real reason why the change happened.
Julie Morgan AM: One of the reasons.
Lynne Neagle AM: Nevertheless, the committee was given very concrete assurances that the Welsh language side of this was going to be covered off. Have you got anything that you want to add on that? Obviously, for us as a committee, we believe what we're told when we are given assurances. So, that's quite concerning for us, really, that that suddenly then became an issue, when both HMRC and the Minister at the time told us that this wasn't going to be a problem.
Nicola Edwards: So, I think it's the point that I was talking about earlier. There's a difference between a bilingual service in the context of what HMRC understood that to be, in the context of their scheme, and the very detail of the standards when they got into their IT systems.
Lynne Neagle AM: Shouldn't that have been something that was worked out at the beginning?
Nicola Edwards: Possibly, but they did need to do quite detailed work, not just into their own IT systems, but the feed-in systems from the Home Office, the Department for Work and Pensions and the Post Office as well, to understand the full complexity of how the standards would comply across all of that. They do provide a bilingual service. It was just some of the specific details of the requirements placed on the Welsh Ministers, because it is the Welsh Ministers'standards that they would need to deliver against that they were struggling with.
Lynne Neagle AM: Right, okay.
Sian Gwenllian AM: Yes, but those standards were there right from the very beginning.
Lynne Neagle AM: I think that the committee would feel that that should have been bottomed out at the beginning, really.
Sian Gwenllian AM: Nothing has changed in terms of the standards.
Lynne Neagle AM: Okay, just before we move on to Flying Start, can I just ask: the Minister mentioned a longer term review of the childcare offer. Are you able to give us any indication of when that will report, please?
Julie Morgan AM: Would we have any idea?
Nicola Edwards: We haven't set out a definitive timescale on that as of yet because we've been focusing very much on getting the review in terms of training, education and on the cusp of returning to work up and running. But sometime next year.
Lynne Neagle AM: Okay. So, it will report sometime next year.
Nicola Edwards: Yes.
Lynne Neagle AM: Okay, thank you. We'll move on now to Flying Start and questions from Suzy Davies.
Suzy Davies AM: Thank you, Chair. Can I just begin by asking you how you respond to the assertion that children from the most disadvantaged backgrounds do better in a mixed socioeconomic environment than in a targeted environment?
Julie Morgan AM: I think that's what Flying Start does, isn't it? Yes, I would have thought that was likely.
Suzy Davies AM: Well, the reason I'm asking you that, of course, is because this committee has suggested, perhaps, changes to the outreach system to target more disadvantaged children, and not necessarily capture people who happen to be in a geographic area.
Julie Morgan AM: So, you're saying that you feel that a universal offer in certain areas is not advantageous to--
Suzy Davies AM: Well, I'm asking you, really. If it's the case that we're only going after disadvantaged children, which would take very precise targeting--
Julie Morgan AM: I'm not only going after disadvantaged children. I feel that we should be offering something for all children, and our considerations are for all children. The reason we've targeted Flying Start is because it would be great if we had enough money to have Flying Start throughout the whole of Wales, but we just don't have that sort of money. Because I think Flying Start has proved to be a great--very successful.
Suzy Davies AM: I'm going to ask you a few more questions on that. Because just in response to this committee's 2018 report, you did say that:'defined geographical targeting of Flying Start support will be considered as part of the Welsh Government's work on the Early Years system.'That suggests you still have geographic targeting in mind. So, if you're looking at a very mixed source of economic experience for children, what are the geographic boundaries you're considering?
Julie Morgan AM: At the moment, Flying Start can go beyond the geographical boundaries, with the extension--
Suzy Davies AM: With limits, yes.
Julie Morgan AM: Yes. I think they can use 10 per cent of their income to go beyond the geographical boundaries, and many of them have done that. But, obviously, there are four elements to Flying Start, and only those geographical areas have got the four elements, but there could be the opportunity of extending some of that beyond the Flying Start geographical areas. We're looking at this.
Suzy Davies AM: I accept what you say about the current system--
Julie Morgan AM: I believe it's much more--. I believe very strongly in having a universal system, where everybody is able to access it.
Suzy Davies AM: I appreciate that as well. But, obviously, there are huge cost implications for that--unless you're giving us some insight into what you're going to say next week, I don't know. But actually, defining anything geographically, which now seems to be fairly arbitrary, because it's not targeted purely at disadvantaged children--on what basis are we choosing the geographic areas we are choosing at the moment?
Julie Morgan AM: Well, they're chosen then because of the benefit take-up in those particular areas. So, it's reaching some of the poorest children, but not all of the poorest children, but it's reaching the poorest children in a way that is not stigmatising, and where the services are open to everybody, and I think that's very important.
Suzy Davies AM: Okay. Well, having established that, we have fairly recent research here that a third of children living in poverty in Wales are already falling behind at the age of five--that suggests that two thirds of them aren't, but it's still a very worrying statistic. Not all children live in Flying Start areas; how are you going to reach that third who, even at such an early age, are already falling behind? How many of them are in Flying Start areas?
Julie Morgan AM: I think the actual number of children in poverty, the most disadvantaged that we reach through the Flying Start areas--I think it's about 46 per cent. Is that--? Do you know the actual percentage?
Suzy Davies AM: It's about a quarter of total children are in there, but--
Jo-Anne Daniels: So, just to give you a few of the numbers, there are just over 36,000 children benefiting from Flying Start services. That equates to about 23 per cent of children, overall, in Wales. And because of the nature of the benefit take-up data, and because we don't assess eligibility within a Flying Start area, we can't be absolutely certain how many children within a Flying Start area are actually in poverty. So, it's an estimate, and it's a range, and the range is that around 45 per cent of children in Flying Start areas would be in poverty. FootnoteLink
Suzy Davies AM: Well, that's interesting. I would have expected it to be much higher than that, particularly if the geographic areas had been targeted on benefit claims, effectively. Are you disappointed that the proportion is--basically, 55 per cent of those children aren't living in poverty. That's what you're saying, isn't it?
Jo-Anne Daniels: Well, I'd offer two observations. One: the nature of poverty in Wales is actually, generally, more dispersed than perhaps sometimes is appreciated. Yes, we have very concentrated areas of--
Suzy Davies AM: Well, actually, we do appreciate it, which is why we're asking this question. [Laughter. ]
Jo-Anne Daniels: Okay. So that's one issue to think about. Sorry, I've lost my train of thought now, in terms of the second--oh, sorry: whether you're in or out of poverty is, in one sense, very black/white. But in reality of course--in terms of the income definition, it's very black/white. But, of course, there will be a large number of people who are just above, but also families who move in and out, so it's quite a transient population in some senses, in terms of people having incomes that aren't stable, people having jobs that go with that that aren't stable. So, at any one point in time, you're only sort of capturing a snapshot of what's happening. In reality, it's a bit more complex than that.
Suzy Davies AM: I accept that. I mentioned a third of children living in poverty had fallen behind at five; by the age of 14, half that number is still falling behind, so something has happened between that third and that half to improve the life chances of those individual children or young people. Is that attributable to Flying Start? Can you say that candidly? Or is it a happy coincidence, where there could be some causation, but we can't prove it?
Jo-Anne Daniels: We certainly think that Flying Start is making a positive impact, both on the point at which children go to school, and then subsequently. And I think as the committee knows, we've been working with the SAIL--secure anonymised information linkage--and the databank there to look at how we can do longitudinal studies to track children's progress, to look at the extent to which outcomes are effected by Flying Start interventions.
Suzy Davies AM: We probably don't have time for this level of detail today, but half of those children are still behind at the age of 14. So, I'd be curious to know if there's any immediate plans to help them catch up or make sure that their successors don't fall into the same position, the same trap. Have you got anything high level that you can mention at this stage?
Julie Morgan AM: Just in terms of what we're thinking of doing with Flying Start--. The key thing about Flying Start is the collaborative way that it works with the health visitors and all the speech and language therapists and childcare, and we're looking at ways of trying to get some of those elements to reach a wider group. And as I said, we talked about earlier the eight earlier years transformation pathfinders that we talked about in the local authorities--we talked about that earlier--so, that's where we're going to look at Flying Start and how we can try to make it more accessible to more children. So, we do want to extend the benefits of Flying Start. We do want to make it available to more children, and that's what we're looking at. And we're looking at that in those eight pathfinder areas. And you'll have to wait to see what we come up with--
Suzy Davies AM: No, no--we'll ask you more about that in due course. Actually, that job would be an awful lot easier if you knew how many children within Flying Start areas were taking up all four elements. Why don't you know that? Why is that data not collected?
Julie Morgan AM: Do we know why?
Jo-Anne Daniels: So, the approach that we've taken to evaluation in Flying Start--. The committee will have seen the various evaluation reports that have been published, and I know that you're familiar with the work that, as I say, we've been doing with SAIL. We're currently focusing on individual data collection, and through that we want to be able to report on levels of engagement, but also outcomes for children. We've been piloting that new approach in six local authorities. We hope to be able to extend that, and we hope to be able to provide more evidence about the interventions and the impact that they then achieve.
Suzy Davies AM: Okay. All right. Because, to be honest, I would want to know if a child's chances have improved primarily because they're getting good-quality childcare or primarily because their parents are taking up parenting courses. There's got to be some indication somewhere in here about which of these four elements is making the greatest difference.
Jo-Anne Daniels: I would just caution in terms of expectations. It will always be quite difficult to definitively provide answers to that, because many parents will be taking these things up in combination. So, disentangling which has had the effect is, obviously, quite tricky--in particular, all parents will be getting the enhanced health visiting. Not every parent will take up parenting support, not every child will need speech and language help, so--
Suzy Davies AM: And that's why we need to know who is.
Jo-Anne Daniels: Disentangling what's helped and what hasn't I think will always be quite a difficult thing to do.
Suzy Davies AM: But it would also be helpful to know which combinations work best as well. Just on the final point from me--yes, 88 per cent of Flying Start's childcare offers were taken up, but we've had some local authorities where the take-up has dropped dramatically. I think Denbighshire was down a fair bit, wasn't it, and Ceredigion, I think, had had a poor take-up. Have you got any indication why? I'm thinking of Denbighshire particularly, where there is a tradition--taking up third-party childcare is cultural there, whereas in Ceredigion, for example, there are far fewer places available in the first place and less of a tradition of children taking up childcare. But what's happened in Denbighshire?
Julie Morgan AM: I think there are a number of different reasons why parents do decide not to use a facility, and, obviously, that always exists, but each local authority has a Flying Start account manager in place to support them in the delivery of the programme and the account management activities, and there are formal account meetings that look at this sort of thing once a year--
Suzy Davies AM: So, what have they told you?
Julie Morgan AM: --and these meetings will take place in November 2019. That's when the specific delivery issues will be discussed in depth, so that's when we'll find out what has happened and why there may have been a drop.
Suzy Davies AM: Can I just ask about the timing of that? Because if you already know that there's a 6 per cent drop, why will it take the best part of a year to--well, November's only next month, to be fair, now, but why will it take that length of time to establish why there's a drop? You'd have thought if you'd seen a trend like that--
Julie Morgan AM: Obviously, they meet at certain times and they will assess what's happened. That seems quite normal to me.
Suzy Davies AM: Okay, but we'll get a note on that, is it? It's just that they knew this six months ago.
Julie Morgan AM: In November, we'll have more information about this, so we can let you have information about that.
Suzy Davies AM: That would be really helpful, just for--. I'm sure constituents in Denbighshire will want to know about that. And then finally from me, Chair, if I may, Flying Start beneficiaries--it's got a specific explanation of what a Flying Start beneficiary is, but I think, particularly in view of the evidence we've heard on this committee about parental support in connection with the removal of the defence of reasonable chastisement, for example, this committee is very concerned about what's out there in terms of parental support. Eighteen per cent of Flying Start beneficiaries have parents attending the informal parenting courses; that's 18 per cent, that's not very high. Any idea about what you might be able to do to encourage take-up or is that very locally decided?
Lynne Neagle AM: If I can add to that, obviously, somebody only has to attend one course--we've got no way of knowing whether parents are completing the whole of a course, really.
Julie Morgan AM: Obviously, the offer is there for parents to take up the parenting courses, and there are four elements to Flying Start, and maybe some of the parents don't feel that they want to or need to. I don't think we've got any more evidence on that for take-up--
Suzy Davies AM: Well, the reach of this is going to be important, because we need the reassurance on the back of the legislation that is going through at the moment.
Julie Morgan AM: Absolutely, yes.
Jo-Anne Daniels: Parenting courses are, of course, one aspect of parenting support, but not the only one, and they'll be appropriate for a lot of parents, but for some not. What all parents do get at an enhanced level in Flying Start is the support of the health visitor, so the health visitor is, in effect, providing a significant amount of support for parenting. Now, that can be practical things like weaning or potty training et cetera, but, actually, it's also about managing a child's behaviour, managing how a parent develops that bonding and that attachment with their child. So, the role of the health visitor in supporting a parent to be a parent is absolutely critical, and every parent in Flying Start areas will be getting that enhanced level of support. Of course, it's not just in Flying Start areas now, because with the Healthy Child Wales programme, the universal programme of health visiting visits, we have a much more consistent and standardised set of visits and engagements with parents that cover a lot of these areas. In addition, I'd also add that when parents use the childcare in Flying Start, or childcare generally outside of Flying Start areas, there is often a lot of working between the childcare setting and the parent over parenting--again, managing a child's behaviour, managing any issues that the childcare worker thinks are emerging in terms of whether it's eating or, again, toileting. So, parenting courses are important, but it's really essential that we see those in the broader context of the different ways in which lots of professionals interact with parents, providing them with advice, guidance and support, and actually what works for parents in terms of how they take on board some of that advice and that help. Sometimes a formal course is quite off-putting for parents, but the sort of quiet word, the top tips, the advice that a friendly professional gives can be very, very impactful.
Suzy Davies AM: That's a really helpful answer. It does raise, unfortunately, another question about whether a health visitor in those circumstances might find themselves in a difficult position if they're dealing with a parent who has smacked a child, but we'll leave that for Stage 3.
Julie Morgan AM: We'll be dealing with that, I'm sure.
Suzy Davies AM: But thank you; that was a helpful answer. Thank you, Chair.
Lynne Neagle AM: Okay. Thank you. Are there any other questions from Members? No. Okay. Well, can I thank the Minister and the officials for attending this morning? As usual, you'll be sent a transcript to check for accuracy following the meeting, but thank you again for your attendance. Thank you.
Julie Morgan AM: Thank you very much.
Lynne Neagle AM: Okay. Item 4 is papers to note. There's just one today: the letter from the WLGA regarding the Childcare Funding (Wales) Act 2019 in response to our letter asking about the change in approach. Item 5 then. Can I propose, in accordance with Standing Order 17. 42, that the committee resolves to meet in private for the remainder of the meeting? Are Members content? Thank you.","The Welsh and UK Governments had followed a demand-driven approach to the childcare market, with subsidies mainly given to working parents, which was a mistake and should be more universally available. The demand-driven approach was based more on certain factors: geographic spread in terms of it being more universal, and whether that's the right way. It was hard for children to mix with peers from different backgrounds and age groups? Next, some areas had traditionally got more childcare anyway because they had traditionally more demand in those areas, so there was not a level playing field to start from.",qmsum
"What did Julie Morgan recommend to do when discussing the demand of Welsh language skills and why?
Lynne Neagle AM: Good morning, everyone. Welcome to the Children, Young People and Education Committee. We've received no apologies for absence this morning. Can I ask if there are any declarations of interest from Members, please? No. Okay. Thank you. Item 3 this morning then is a scrutiny session on early childhood education and care, and I'm very pleased to welcome Julie Morgan AM, Deputy Minister for Health and Social Services; Jo-anne Daniels, director of communities and tackling poverty at Welsh Government; and Nicola Edwards, deputy director of the childcare, play and early years division in Welsh Government. Thank you all for your attendance. We're very much looking forward to the session. If you're happy, we'll go straight into questions, and the first ones are from Hefin David.
Hefin David AM: Good morning, Deputy Minister. What are your primary objectives? Is it supporting the development of children or getting parents into work?
Julie Morgan AM: Well, I think you'll be aware from the range of programmes that we've got that we do feel it's important to support both children and parents. There's obviously lots of evidence to show how important the early years are for children, how important they are for their development, and so, that is one of our primary objectives. But we also know how important it is for parents to have stable jobs, reasonably paid, so that can also help with the development of the children. So, we really see it that our plans are for both parents and children, and we believe that a high-quality, early-childhood education and care system can provide that. And, of course, in terms of when we talk about jobs as well, I think it's really important to remember that the childcare system is a big employer as well and a very important employer. So that, actually, itself provides jobs.
Hefin David AM: So, the evidence we've seen suggests that, historically, Governments in the UK and devolved have focused on primarily getting parents into work. So, are you suggesting then that your focus is to change that and move towards early child development?
Julie Morgan AM: No, what I'm saying is that we want to give parents the opportunity to work. We don't want childcare to be a barrier to parents working because we think that working is one the best routes out of poverty, but we do also want to make sure that children have the greatest experience that they can have in the early years. So, we see it as one.
Hefin David AM: Okay. And that's quite a policy challenge to deliver both at the same time.
Julie Morgan AM: The situation as it is is complex, and I think it needs simplifying. It is a challenge, but it's probably one of the most important challenges we've got in Government, because what we offer to families with young children is one of the most important things we do.
Hefin David AM: And in your evidence to the committee, you said that the Welsh Government's approach'will build on a wide variety of programmes that are continually developing in order to support parents, families and children during the early years.'And you've just said you want to simplify that. How do you simplify that, particularly with regard to the provision of funding and the way these things connect from the birth of a child into school? How will simplification look, and what will happen?
Julie Morgan AM: Well, we're not at the stage of being able to say what it will look like at the moment, but we're looking at ways of simplifying, because I think it's absolutely right, it is a very complex system, because it's grown up from all different routes. But we are having lots of pilot projects that are looking at ways of simplifying the system. We have got pathway projects in, I think it's eight local authorities, who are looking at ways of joining up the whole system. So, we are looking at that, and I absolutely except that it is very complex and we want to find ways of making it simpler and easier to understand. So, we are working with local authorities and health boards to see how we can actually work together and simplify things.
Hefin David AM: And it's good to hear that that's your objective. Can I just come back to the first thing you said:'We can't say yet what we're going to do'?
Julie Morgan AM: No.
Hefin David AM: So, when will we have a policy plan and something that we can interrogate in more detail?
Julie Morgan AM: Well, I think we are near getting to an announcement where we will be able to say what direction we're going in, and because we have had--. Some of this work has been going on for a year or so, and we're getting the results of those pathfinder projects coming in. So, when we do have all those results, we will be able to say the direction that we want to go in, and I hope we'll be able to do that very soon.
Hefin David AM: Before Christmas?
Julie Morgan AM: I hope so.
Hefin David AM: Okay. And finally from me--
Julie Morgan AM: I'm sorry I can't say too much about that because we haven't actually--. We need to--.
Hefin David AM: Well, it does sound like something is imminent.
Julie Morgan AM: Yes.
Hefin David AM: Okay. And that's as far as you're willing to go. And if that's as far as you're willing to go, then I'll stop asking.
Lynne Neagle AM: I've got a supplementary from Sian.
Hefin David AM: Okay.
Julie Morgan AM: Yes, that's fine.
Sian Gwenllian AM: I just want to understand a little about the pilot, the pathfinders in eight local authority areas. Is the focus there on the child or is it on parents returning to work?
Julie Morgan AM: The focus is on an early years system, but we've worked both locally and nationally. So, it's looking at both. I mean, actually, I think, perhaps, Nicola, would you like to or one of you like to describe one of the programmes?
Sian Gwenllian AM: And can you just explain the vision? Is it a child-centred early years provision that we're thinking of in these pathfinder--?
Jo-Anne Daniels: So, in'Prosperity for All', we set out that early years was one of the key priority areas, and within that we said that we wanted to create a more joined-up and more responsive system. So, when we talk about a system, we're talking about the services that are provided by health boards, so health visiting, midwifery, speech and language support, other kinds of therapeutic services, as well as all the important services that local authorities are providing, such as support for parenting, advice and guidance, employment support and childcare, obviously. And we've got eight pathfinders. I'll try and remember each of them. So, Flintshire, Newport, Blaenau Gwent, Neath Port Talbot, Swansea, Ceredigion, Pembrokeshire--and then I've missed one, I think, because I've only got to seven--who have been working with us to look at how all of those services are currently delivered in their local area and whether and how they can reorganise those services to improve accessibility, to improve take-up, but essentially to improve the efficacy of those programmes in terms of supporting children, but often, obviously, in supporting children you have to support parents too and support the home.
Sian Gwenllian AM: So, would you say it's a child-centred approach?
Jo-Anne Daniels: Absolutely, because it's about making sure that we deliver the best start in life for children in Wales, but obviously parents are a critical element of that, so can't be excluded.
Lynne Neagle AM: And how long have they been going for?
Jo-Anne Daniels: So, those eight pathfinders started their work in--I think it was--February this year. And they're still in the very early stages in terms of actually unpicking and mapping the current provision of services across their areas and then moving on to the stage where they'll develop proposals for how they might change the delivery of early years.
Lynne Neagle AM: Okay, thank you. Julie.
Julie Morgan AM: Just to say also, the one in Flintshire is also testing the impact of consistent funding rates for education and childcare. So, that's been going longer than the others. So, that's another important area because there's an evaluation of that project under way at the moment.
Lynne Neagle AM: Thank you.
Jo-Anne Daniels: Sorry, but Caerphilly was the one that I forgot to mention.
Lynne Neagle AM: Oh dear. [Laughter. ]
Hefin David AM: That's absolutely unforgivable. [Laughter. ]
Lynne Neagle AM: Hefin. [Laughter. ]
Julie Morgan AM: Very significant.
Hefin David AM: In your report, the'Alignment of the Childcare Offer for Wales to the Foundation Phase', one of the recommendations was that'The Welsh Government, local authority education and childcare policy and delivery teams could merge'. So, looking behind the scenes, those disparate parts of policy, delivering the foundation phase and childcare offer should merge. Is that the case? Has that been put under way and should we be looking at this structure in more depth?
Julie Morgan AM: Well, probably not at the structure at this time because the report that you're referring to was looking at the first year of the delivery of the childcare offer and it did make a number of points, which we have taken on board. For example, we issued guidance last year regarding the delivery of the foundation phase, which supports widening the number of non-maintained settings that are able to deliver early education and we're also supporting co-location and partnership working between education and childcare providers through our capital investment programme. I think it's about PS81 million that we put into the capital investment where we are developing childcare facilities co-located with the education facilities, because that was one of the things that came out from this report you're referring to. And, I mean, obviously, early years is one of the key priorities within'Prosperity for All'and, obviously, education sits within one portfolio with the Minister for Education, and childcare is with me. But we're doing what we can to work together to try to bring those together, and that was one of the proposals in that report. But it's still very early to think about, at this stage, a structural change.
Hefin David AM: And I remember when you were on the committee here with me, sitting next to me, we had those discussions about co-location. I know the problem with not having co-location is that you could end up seeing a child travelling between three or more locations during the course of a day. Are you suggesting now that the actions you're taking will resolve that issue universally, or will it lead to a piecemeal resolution? And, if so, to what extent, what percentage of children will see that resolved as an issue?
Julie Morgan AM: Certainly, the co-location is not going to solve it universally because although we've been able to develop a lot of new facilities, or build on old facilities, there will be a lot of areas that we won't have covered. So, I can't say that there's going to be a situation where everything is going to be co-located because I don't think that would be feasible, and, for some of the providers, they wouldn't be in a position to move to a school. But ideally it's a good situation, but, certainly, I think the discussions that there were on the committee, it's not ideal to take children for long distances between different providers, let alone the effect it has on the climate change issue. It's whether it's good for children as well. So, I can't say that they will ever be co-located, but as I said in response to your earlier question, we are encouraging the development of the foundation phase in non-maintained settings, which, obviously, is quite significant.
Lynne Neagle AM: Okay. Thank you. I've got some questions now from Janet Finch-Saunders.
Janet Finch-Saunders AM: Thank you, Chair. What is the Welsh Government doing to address the big differences in the amount of early childhood education and care provision available in different parts of Wales?
Julie Morgan AM: Right. Well, thank you very much for that question. I mean, obviously, it would be good to see a greater degree of consistency, but I think it's important to acknowledge that there are reasons for that variation. Now, early education, of course, is the responsibility of the Minister for Education, and we are aware that different local authorities have adopted different patterns of providing early education. For example, local authorities are funded to provide 10 hours minimum of the foundation phase for three and four-year-olds across Wales, but there's quite a variance in how much is actually provided, with some local authorities providing a lot more historically. So, it does mean that there is a different pattern across Wales, according to what local authorities do. But what I could say is, of course, the quality is very good, as the Estyn reports have shown; that the quality provided, the delivery of the foundation phase, is very good. But it does vary in terms of what is offered throughout Wales, and that is the decision of the local authorities, and it is a historical thing. I refer to this pilot in Flint, which is trying to test paying the same rate for foundation phase and childcare. We're going to have an independent evaluation on that soon, in November this year, so that will help us. Obviously, I think local authorities'role in all this is absolutely crucial because they are the local, nearest people to decide how things develop in their own areas. And then, of course, we've got Flying Start, which is geographically targeted, which uses the data from income benefit to decide which are the areas where that is being delivered. And that is delivered where the highest proportion of children aged nought to three are living in income-dependent households. So, again, that determines the pattern throughout Wales. With Flying Start being geographically targeted, with the education being determined by the local authorities about how much there is, we know that there is a variance throughout Wales. We'd like to see facilities developed in each local authority throughout Wales that would answer the needs of the families and the children in those areas.
Lynne Neagle AM: Before you move on, Janet, Sian's got a supplementary.
Sian Gwenllian AM: Just in terms of the foundation phase, there have been cuts, of course, in expenditure in that phase. How concerned are you about that and the impact that that will have on the way in which the foundation phase is taught in our schools? The foundation phase is now part of the education improvement grant, which has seen a reduction of 10 per cent, and it has to compete against other expenditure streams within that greater pot of funding. So, are you concerned that money is being lost and that that will have an impact on standards in the foundation phase?
Julie Morgan AM: I haven't seen any evidence. Obviously, I must reiterate the foundation phase does come under the Minister for Education, but I haven't seen any evidence of any standards being lowered, and the reports from Estyn are very good. In fact, I think the foundation phase is one of our great joys, that we absolutely celebrate it, and so I'd be very concerned if I thought there was any drop in standards in the foundation phase, and I certainly haven't had any evidence of that. I would want to guard against that.
Sian Gwenllian AM: Exactly, but if there are fewer teaching assistants in the system because of the cuts, it's going to impact on standards, at the end of the day.
Julie Morgan AM: I think we have to be very careful to see that lower standards are not implemented, because it was groundbreaking when we brought it in, and it has proved to be a great success, so we want to make sure that's guarded.
Lynne Neagle AM: Thank you. Janet.
Janet Finch-Saunders AM: Going back to my original question about the big differences in amounts of early childhood education and care provision in different parts of Wales, the Welsh and UK Governments have followed a demand-driven approach to the childcare market, with subsidies mainly given to working parents. Is that a mistake? Should it be more universally available?
Julie Morgan AM: Well, some of our provision is universally available in certain areas. For example, the Flying Start provision is universally available in geographically defined areas, and I think that's very important, because that does mean that there isn't stigma, and so, in those areas, everybody can take advantage of it, and yet it is reaching those who are most in need because it's reaching those areas. So, I think that there is a purpose behind that. In terms of when you say demand led, could you elaborate on that?
Janet Finch-Saunders AM: I know that--we've just had a useful briefing from David Dallimore, and, basically, there is this theory that there are too many resources--the demand-driven approach is based more on certain factors: geographic spread in terms of it being more universal, and whether that's the right way. How do children then mix with peers from different backgrounds, in their own peer or age group?
Julie Morgan AM: It is demand--
Nicola Edwards: [Inaudible. ]--because the offer is targeted at working parents--
Janet Finch-Saunders AM: Yes, yes.
Nicola Edwards: --obviously, then the amount of availability is based on how many parents apply for it and take it up. Is that the context of demand led in that--
Janet Finch-Saunders AM: Yes.
Nicola Edwards: Right, okay.
Julie Morgan AM: It is universally available to all parents who meet the eligibility criteria of working, and I think what you're saying is that it should be available to everybody.
Lynne Neagle AM: I think the point that Janet's making is that some areas have traditionally got more childcare anyway because they have traditionally had more demand in those areas, so there's not a level playing field to start from. Is that correct?
Janet Finch-Saunders AM: Yes.
Julie Morgan AM: I think that, historically, that is definitely true, and when you look at the take-up of the childcare offer, it's certainly taken up in some areas with a very high take-up rate. I think Ynys Mon was nearly 90 per cent or something--
Sian Gwenllian AM: They need more money, because they haven't got enough funding.
Dawn Bowden AM: So does everywhere.
Sian Gwenllian AM: No, to meet the demand.
Julie Morgan AM: In other areas, it's much, much lower--in some of the cities, I know. So, there is a big range in take-up--
Janet Finch-Saunders AM: So, do you intend to bring something forward to address that?
Julie Morgan AM: We are planning to extend it. We're looking at the possibility of extending it to parents who are in education and training. So, we are widening the offer, yes. Obviously, we have to wait for the evaluation of that. It would be great to be able to offer it to absolutely everybody, but obviously we have got the finance to look at in terms of how we do that. But we are certainly planning to expand it.
Lynne Neagle AM: We've got questions on the offer in a little while. Janet.
Janet Finch-Saunders AM: Does the Welsh Government intend to develop an integrated approach, then, against all settings? If so, given the current inconsistencies, how can quality be assured?
Julie Morgan AM: We are developing a more integrated approach towards the early years. As I've said, we're trying to have the foundation phase operating in more non-maintained settings, and we're already developing that. But Estyn and CIW will continue to inspect and regulate the early years sector to ensure standards, and, since January 2019, CIW and Estyn have moved to joint inspections for the non-maintained settings that are offering the foundation phase. So, that is a very positive move, I think, and is absolutely making sure that standards are maintained, because if we are having the foundation phase in non-maintained settings, that is a challenge where we want to be sure that the standards and the philosophy of the foundation phase are maintained. So, we have got the system of inspection to ensure that.
Janet Finch-Saunders AM: And finally from me, what specific steps have been put in place to take forward the commitments from the Welsh Government's 2017 childcare/play early years workforce plan to build a better understanding of the workforce's Welsh language skills to enable support for the sector to be targeted and to identify where capacity needs to be built for the future to meet the needs of the early years sector in a bilingual Wales?
Julie Morgan AM: We think this is very important, and we're pleased that 29 per cent of children taking up the childcare offer are in Welsh or bilingual settings, so we think that's very good. We have established a specific programme to develop Welsh language skills in the childcare and play workforce with the National Centre for Learning Welsh, to develop workplace Welsh language skills across the sector. So, we're actually working with that, and I think you've done something with those recently, haven't you? I don't know if you want to--
Nicola Edwards: Yes. So, we have a stakeholder group where we've brought together a variety of people with an interest in the early years, childcare and play sectors, and we had a presentation just last month from the national language centre about the education programmes that they're rolling out, and how this is all coming together, which is quite interesting. We've been working quite carefully to make sure that the variety of work-based learning programmes that we provide and offer are also available in Welsh and bilingually. Recruitment and retention within the childcare and play sector is quite challenging in any case. Recruiting and retaining staff with really good Welsh language skills adds an extra dimension to it, and that it's a point that Mudiad Meithrin makes to us quite regularly, that they do struggle to find staff with the right skills. So, upskilling the existing workforce is a key part of it, but also doing more to attract people in with Welsh language skills in the first place in terms of the training courses that we're taking forward, and thinking about that in the context of the targets within Cymraeg 2050 and the aim to get to one million Welsh speakers. So, as the Deputy Minister said, we've got quite a number of children accessing the offer in Welsh-medium or bilingual settings at the moment. We're going to be doing some baselining work against that in terms of local authorities'Welsh in education strategic plans and education places, and what we can then do to increase the number of childcare places in parallel with that so that you can make sure that you start that pathway through learning Welsh, interacting with education and childcare through Welsh at a much earlier stage.
Lynne Neagle AM: Suzy, you've got a supplementary.
Suzy Davies AM: Just on this early point, anybody who's been through the Welsh education system, which is 20 years now, will have some Welsh language skills, obviously to differing degrees. For the entrants that are coming into childcare training now, there are going to be very few of them, realistically, with no Welsh at all, so what's actually being incorporated into the early years care training to make sure, at that stage, that the Welsh language skills are being developed, as opposed to an add-on later on?
Nicola Edwards: You're quite right. Most people coming through the education system will have some awareness of Welsh although I think it's probably important to remember we do also employ people from outside of wales.
Suzy Davies AM: Yes, but the majority, being realistic.
Nicola Edwards: But they don't necessarily have Welsh that is appropriate. They've got Welsh that they've developed in school. It's not necessarily appropriate for then teaching that language to children, who may be coming from families who don't use Welsh at home. So, that might be the first interaction that child has with the language. So, there's a lot of that in terms of child development and how you develop children bilingually, particularly if they're coming from English-medium homes, and reinforcing the language in language choices. There will also be some people who are, perhaps--we see this quite a lot in the office--quite confident in terms of speaking Welsh but less so in terms of some of the paperwork, the reporting, the writing and the interacting with parents more officially, which we need to think about as well. But it is mainly about getting people to a point where they can transmit that language onwards in a confident and meaningful way.
Suzy Davies AM: Okay. And it's ingrained in the early years training.
Nicola Edwards: Yes.
Suzy Davies AM: Okay. That's fine. Thank you for that. Thank you, Chair.
Lynne Neagle AM: Just before we move on, you said that 29 per cent of the take-up of the childcare offer is either through Welsh or is bilingual. Have you got any figures about how many children are accessing it in Welsh only?
Nicola Edwards: We will have. It becomes--. With the way we do it, it's because of the way that the setting defines their language category, and that's how we collect it. We do go down to individual child level, although it's anonymised, data collection on a termly basis. So I'll have a look and see if we can send you through the last term.
Lynne Neagle AM: Maybe if the committee could have a note, that would be really useful.
Nicola Edwards: Yes, that's fine.
Lynne Neagle AM: We've got some questions now on childcare from Dawn Bowden.
Dawn Bowden AM: Thank you, Chair. Deputy Minister, the evaluation of the childcare offer, when it was published last year, said that there was very little evidence currently available to determine what its impact was. You're going to be producing a second evaluation in November this year; do you expect to see some indications now of the impact?
Julie Morgan AM: Well, the evaluation of the first year of the childcare offer was very limited, because the childcare offer wasn't available throughout the whole of Wales. And it was a very early implementation phase. So, obviously it takes time to grow. And the evaluation for year 2, I think, will also show a limited impact for the same reasons. The offer became available across the whole of Wales only last April. So we've only got since last April that it's actually been fully available. And the parental survey was released to parents in June 2019, therefore any impact on parents in the authorities coming on board in the second year will also be negligible. So, it's from the next one, however, we hope that we will get more information.
Dawn Bowden AM: So you think, by the time we get to November 2020, you might have a better picture.
Julie Morgan AM: The evaluation will be more meaningful, we think, then, yes.
Dawn Bowden AM: Okay. I take that point. What the first year's evaluation did show, however, was that 94 per cent of respondents said that they were already using formal childcare before the offer came into place. A couple of things, really: are you surprised at that, and is that likely to inform the way that you develop the offer in the future?
Julie Morgan AM: No, I'm not surprised at all. When it started off, it was only available in seven local authorities. In terms of how the families found out that it was available, they found it out through the childcare providers, where they already had their children there. So it was absolutely what we would have expected, and that will continue. But, of course, we were not able to fully advertise the childcare offer until it was available in all the local authorities, which was last April. So we are planning, this autumn, quite a big push now to try to make it available to everybody--so everybody knows about it. So, no, this is the pattern we would have expected, and I think anybody who's involved in starting up something in childcare will know you have to wait a number of years before you actually see it being fully taken up.
Dawn Bowden AM: I guess the question that it raises in my mind is: does this mean that, actually, it hasn't been an incentive to get somebody back into work, because they were already in work and already had childcare provision? What you've done is you've directed money to people who were already spending that money anyway. So it hasn't been a move towards getting people into work because they couldn't afford childcare.
Julie Morgan AM: Well I think that that is something that we are moving towards, because the take-up of the offer is actually increasing each month, which is why I call it a great success. At the end of July, we hit almost 16,000 children accessing the offer, which obviously means that there are 16,000 families benefiting from this, and the feedback that we have had from parents is that they have been able to--. They've got more money available, which is obvious, which is great, because obviously more money is available to plunge into the economy and carry out that sort of thing, and we've got examples of parents who've been supported into work through programmes like Parents, Childcare and Employment to begin with, and then have gone on to access the offer. So, that's again a progression. So, I think we are seeing signs that people are moving on, have got more ability to be flexible in the work that they're doing, but I hope that when we look at it again, we will be able to see people actually moving into work because of having the access to childcare.
Dawn Bowden AM: Okay. Before--
Lynne Neagle AM: Are you going to move on? Sian's got a supplementary.
Sian Gwenllian AM: Just a question on funding for the childcare offer. If you foresee that there's going to be more people going to be taking up that offer through the fact that you're marketing it more, what if the same situation arises that has happened on Anglesey? The take-up has been very good there, but the money that the Welsh Government has been allocating to Anglesey doesn't match that. What if it happens in every local authority right across Wales? Are you confident there's going to be plenty of money available to respond to that demand?
Julie Morgan AM: Based on the current levels of take-up and looking at the rates of increase each month, we expect to spend in the region of PS50 million to PS55 million in this financial year. Our published plans already include the provision of PS40 million, and we're absolutely committed to making available the total funding that is needed to deliver on the offer. It is fantastic to see the offer being so well received on Ynys Mon, recognising, as Janet said earlier, it is demand led. We are managing it within the normal budgetary process. Local authorities will get the full funding that is needed. It's this year now that the big increase has happened; the previous two years--
Sian Gwenllian AM: So, local authorities won't have to find the extra money out of their own pots.
Julie Morgan AM: No, absolutely not. This is funded by the Welsh Government.
Sian Gwenllian AM: Yes. You can assure them.
Lynne Neagle AM: Dawn.
Dawn Bowden AM: Thank you, Chair. You've already alluded to this in answer to Janet earlier on, about extending the childcare offer to those in training and education. You also talk about'on the cusp'of returning to work. So, I'm not quite sure what'on the cusp'of returning to work is, but from the committee's point of view, we're very pleased that you've reached that conclusion, because it was one of the recommendations that we had following the scrutiny of the Bill. So, can you say a little more about that, bearing in mind that I'm also conscious that you've told Hefin you're going to be making an announcement shortly? So you may not be able to say too much. But a little bit more about the inclusion of parents in training and education, what'on the cusp of returning to work'is--what that means from your perspective--and how you've arrived at that decision now, six months into the programme. What is it that's made you move towards that conclusion?
Julie Morgan AM: Well, obviously, the children and young persons committee made a very good case for education and training, in particular; I think that was one of the things that was at the top of the list. What we've committed to do is to review the programme, particularly looking at how we could bring in education and training, and that review will report early next year. So, early next year, we will have a view on how we could go forward. But the other thing that's also happened is that, obviously, with the new First Minister, that was one of his manifesto commitments--that he would bring education and training in. So, we're obviously following the--
Dawn Bowden AM: Because that was one of the key drivers for that as well.
Julie Morgan AM: Yes, so that is another of the key drivers, as you said--the committee and what the First Minister said. There are a wealth of programmes supporting parents into education, training or work, and many of those do provide support with childcare costs. But we have, by rolling out this programme, the childcare programme, highlighted some gaps where people have felt that they, particularly people who are in full-time education--and I can think of a number of people who are actually doing PhD studies--who are--the letters may have come in from some of your constituents--not able to access the offer as things stand. So, we are looking at people who are in full-time education and training. We're using the definition by the Office for National Statistics, aren't we, in terms of education and training. And on'on the cusp of work', maybe that will have to be something we have to look at differently--those people who are actually maybe undertaking very short training programmes, preparation for work, maybe actually having interviews, where they need help with childcare, that they're sort of almost there. So, they may have to be dealt with in a different way, but I think we do want to look at those. This is expanding the offer; it's not making it universal, but it's moving on.
Dawn Bowden AM: So, what are the--? Overall, then, what are the factors that you're having to take into account? Is it going to be what is needed in order to encourage people back into work? Is it going to be cost? Is it going to be a combination of all of those things? What are going to be the key factors that you're going to be looking at?
Julie Morgan AM: Well, the position now is that anybody who fulfills the criteria in terms of the number of hours they work, we would look at that in terms of education and training, and then, this expression'on the cusp of work'we may have to look at differently, because they may not fulfil those numbers in terms of number of hours training. So, we'll get a criteria, and then they will have access to the childcare offer. But I just have to emphasise that there are ways of getting help with childcare already, and we wanted to make sure we don't duplicate. That's why this field is so complex, shall we say, because there's so many different ways that you can actually get help, and we want to be sure that we don't duplicate--
Dawn Bowden AM: Sorry, Julie. So, all of this is going to be incorporated in this announcement that you're going to be making shortly--
Julie Morgan AM: No, this review will report early next year.
Dawn Bowden AM: Okay. My final question--
Lynne Neagle AM: Before you move on, sorry, I've got a couple of supplementaries. I've got Suzy, then Sian. Sorry, Dawn.
Suzy Davies AM: Just on the cost element, because if you do roll out this programme, obviously, on the back of evidence through a review, it is going to cost extra money. Early years is one of the eight priority areas for Government. There are fairly generous Barnett consequentials coming from the comprehensive spending review and announcements on schools from the UK Government, and while I accept that you've only got annual commitments there, they're still substantial. How much money have you managed to secure for early years from the most recent announcement, and when have you planned to actually use that, maybe for some of this work?
Julie Morgan AM: Have you got some information on that?
Nicola Edwards: The budget process is ongoing internally, so I think'secured'is probably a slightly premature phrase.
Suzy Davies AM: Am I allowed to ask instead how much you've asked for, then? All I'm after is some reassurance that you will be getting some of this money, and as it is one of the eight priorities, certainly we would expect to see you getting a substantial amount of money for early years.
Julie Morgan AM: As one of the Government's priorities, we would expect to get any money that came as a result of any Barnett consequentials.
Suzy Davies AM: Okay. And it will be in the draft budget that we know for sure if it is successful.
Julie Morgan AM: It's all in the process--
Lynne Neagle AM: And the committee will want to look very carefully at that, obviously.
Julie Morgan AM: It's in the process at the moment.
Suzy Davies AM: There we are. Just giving you a good warning.
Lynne Neagle AM: Sian.
Sian Gwenllian AM: How much would it cost to move to a child-centred approach, which means that every child would be able to access the childcare offer, rather than doing it from parents?
Julie Morgan AM: We are looking at that. We're having a longer-term review, in terms of what it would mean if every child had access to the childcare offer. We don't have those figures yet. We've got the one review looking at bringing in education and training. That should report early next year, and then we've got another longer-term review, looking at what a universal offer would mean.
Sian Gwenllian AM: Do we know how many children we're talking about?
Nicola Edwards: Yes. So, there are approximately, at any given time, around 73,000 three and four-year-olds in Wales. There's some slight rounding in the numbers there, but approximately 73,000 at any given time. Based on the current eligibility criteria for the offer, it's about 34,000 children, we believe, are eligible. This does, of course, vary, depending on a whole range of different factors, and we certainly know from what we're seeing from the offer that, even where people are entitled to something, they don't necessarily take it up. And even if they do take it up, they don't necessarily take up their full entitlement, which is also something that we'd have to think about in terms of any modelling on costings.
Sian Gwenllian AM: So, half the children are in non-working families.
Nicola Edwards: It's because of the requirement that, in a two-parent household, both parents must be in work.
Sian Gwenllian AM: Yes. Two parent. Okay.
Lynne Neagle AM: One of the points that the committee made very strongly in our report on the Bill was that we wanted to see a much more child-centred focus, and one of the issues that came out in scrutiny was whether, actually, three and four-year-olds were the right age to be actually targeting if we're looking at things like child development. Have you given any consideration to the actual age group that's covered when we know that, for many children, it's the first 1,000 days that makes that fundamental difference?
Julie Morgan AM: We are aware that there is a case that says that two years old is a very important time. We are looking at that as part of the overall longer review, yes. We are aware of the information and what you're saying about the younger the better.
Lynne Neagle AM: Okay, thank you. Dawn.
Dawn Bowden AM: Yes, my final question, Chair, thank you, is about the parent, childcare and employment programme, which is jointly funded by the European social fund and Welsh Government. It has been quite successful, in terms of its numbers anyway, in getting economically inactive parents into work. What are the plans for this programme, if and when we leave the EU and we lose the ESF funding for that?
Julie Morgan AM: Well, the programme has recently been extended, with delivery continuing until June 2022, with additional ESF funding of PS5. 6 million. That's recently happened, and obviously this programme provides intensive employment to parents who are not in education, employment or training or economically inactive and where the childcare is the main barrier, and it has been a very, very successful programme. So, the UK has guaranteed funding for all EU projects approved by December 2020, and this includes the PaCE programme. I think there was also another--. I only heard it verbally. I heard some other guarantees on the radio recently from the UK Treasury about guaranteeing some of these funds. I don't know whether anybody else heard that. But the Welsh Government can only draw on the UK Government guarantee for claims that aren't paid by the European Commission, and so the current arrangements are staying in place.
Dawn Bowden AM: Until when, sorry?
Julie Morgan AM: Well, June 2022.
Dawn Bowden AM: Oh, I see. Yes. So, that's when all the current commitments expire, basically. Yes. So, we don't know--. To do that it would have to be part of Government planning in terms of--
Julie Morgan AM: Well, we don't know what's happening with that--
Dawn Bowden AM: --what would happen beyond that.
Julie Morgan AM: --funding, but there have been some promises from the UK Government recently, but nothing definite.
Dawn Bowden AM: Yes, we're not holding our breath.
Julie Morgan AM: No.
Dawn Bowden AM: Okay. Thank you, Chair.
Lynne Neagle AM: Okay, thank you. Sian's got some specific questions now around the Childcare Funding (Wales) Act 2019.
Sian Gwenllian AM: As we know, of course, the work with Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs has ended, and I know you weren't the Minister who initiated this process, but what exactly has gone wrong? What are these issues that have come to light that have made you suspend that? It's very frustrating for us, as a committee, who scrutinised that extensively and raised a lot of concerns about that. And a lot of time has been spent talking about this funding Bill, and money--PS1 million, I understand--has been wasted, if you like, unnecessarily. So, what exactly has gone wrong? Why aren't you discussing these things with HMRC?
Julie Morgan AM:
Sian Gwenllian AM: Yes. So, thank you for that explanation.
Julie Morgan AM: I've got more to say as well.
Sian Gwenllian AM: Yes, but for your transparency around your particular view that it needs to be more flexible and expanded upon and, therefore, going down the HMRC route was--
Julie Morgan AM: It would have restricted us a lot.
Sian Gwenllian AM: Yes. We knew that from the beginning. I mean, that's, you know--. So, it was a principle decision rather than any sort of technical matters to do with the Welsh language standards. That's been cited as one kind of--. But I'm really understanding more now that, really, what it's about is that you want to have a more flexible, and expand on the offer and that this would curtail--going through HMRC would put limits on that.
Julie Morgan AM: That is one of the reasons, but there were issues about the Welsh language, which we can go into in detail, if you'd like. There were some issues about that. They would be able to process things bilingually, and I think that was probably told to the committee when we looked at the HMRC. But, in terms of the Welsh language standards that the Minister has to use, there would be some difficulties in them doing it.
Sian Gwenllian AM: But would you say that your main change came about because you wanted to be more flexible rather than any difficulties--
Julie Morgan AM: One of the major reasons, I think--
Sian Gwenllian AM: Okay. Good.
Julie Morgan AM: But there are--. As I say, there are other reasons. Those technical reasons probably do end up being quite important--
Sian Gwenllian AM: But the committee was told by the previous Minister that HMRC wouldn't have any problem at all with delivering according to the Welsh language standards.
Julie Morgan AM: Do you want to add something to this?
Nicola Edwards: So, in terms of some of the technical issues we had, if you want to start with the bilingual provision and the Welsh language standards, HMRC do provide a bilingual service at the moment for their customers in line with their Welsh language scheme, and I think we can all appreciate that schemes are quite different from the requirements of the standards. And there were some issues when we got into the detail of the standards that the Welsh Ministers are required to deliver to that caused some concerns in terms of how HMRC were going to do it, particularly in terms of the multiple IT systems that go into building up the childcare services. So, for example, there are a number of what are called'special characters'in the Welsh alphabet, such as the to bach, for example. The HMRC IT system has some issues with that.
Sian Gwenllian AM: Yes, well, with due respect, the to bach has always been there--
Nicola Edwards: Oh, yes, I completely agree. Unfortunately, however--
Sian Gwenllian AM: --and HMRC would have been able to tell you, really early on, you would have thought, that it was--. I don't really want to go into it, because I think we've got to the crux of why HMRC was dropped. I think it's been dropped because Julie feels that the offer needs to be more flexible, and I can understand why you would say that.
Julie Morgan AM: If we bring in training and education, for example, we wouldn't be able to do that via the HMRC, it would have to be done by the local authorities. Foster parents have to be done via the local authorities. Any people of immigration status of no resource from public funds, that would have to be done via the local authorities. And with the local authorities also wanting to do it--. I mean, there are other things with using HMRC--if any changes were made with the English offer, for example, because this would be delivered via HMRC with the English offer, that would cause difficulties for the Welsh offer. So, we wanted something more flexible. I don't know if there's anything more you want to add on that.
Jo-Anne Daniels: The only thing I'd add is that--and, again, I think the Minister has referred to this--the costs that HMRC presented us with at the end of the discovery phase were significantly higher than the costs that had initially been outlined and that we outlined to the committee in the regulatory impact assessment. So, our conclusion is that we can deliver a cheaper system and a system that has the flexibility that the Deputy Minister has referred to by working with local authorities rather than HMRC. So, there is an important issue around value for money as well and making sure that the investment that we're making into developing the national system is one that--that, in a sense, that investment stays in Wales. So, obviously, the money that we're paying over to HMRC to run the system would be supporting HMRC and their employees wherever they may be based, many of them not based in Wales; investment in local authorities to administer the system means that we're retaining more of that investment here.
Sian Gwenllian AM: Well, I congratulate you on persuading local government and WLGA to change their minds, because they actually told this committee that they favoured the HMRC option--and this is only going back a few months--because it will remove--and this is quoting them--'it will remove the administrative burden of receiving applications and checking eligibility from local authorities'-- blah, blah, blah, blah. So, they've obviously changed their minds as well, which is, you know--. I congratulate you on that, but it does present us as a committee with a little bit of a problem, really, because, if we're told one thing a few months ago and then we're told something completely different today, you know, evidence--we have to go on evidence that we've heard, and the evidence has changed now.
Julie Morgan AM: I think, during the period since it was discussed on the committee, the work with the HMRC has helped highlight to us where we needed to go. So, I think we did learn a lot and it certainly has helped show to us where we think is the best place to go. I would like to pay tribute to the local authorities, because they've been great partners in this and they're very positive about moving forward keeping the work. And there's also a feeling that, because they are so much closer to the local public than HMRC is, they're able to build up links with families and help with some of these difficult issues. Because I'm sure many of you may have had individual cases--I certainly have--where there's been quite a lot of complexity about helping people fill in the forms and look at their eligibility. So, I say well done to the local authorities. And thanks to the HMRC, because we've had nothing but a very positive relationship with them.
Lynne Neagle AM: Suzy, you've got a supplementary.
Suzy Davies AM: Thank you. Ms Daniels, you referred to value for money. How much is it actually going to cost to change this system from being a temporary arrangement with local authorities to a permanent one? And how much more is it going to cost for the more flexible system that you have in mind? They're not going to do this for nothing. How much extra are you giving them, and will they use it for this? How are you ensuring it's used for this?
Jo-Anne Daniels: So, at the moment, local--. So, two things. Just to start by saying the eligibility checking process is not undertaken by all 22 local authorities.
Suzy Davies AM: No, no, I realise that. Yes, I got all that.
Jo-Anne Daniels: So, part of the reason for using 10 is to try to ensure that we build economies of scale and that we have a more efficient operation. Those authorities that undertake that function are given a specific grant in order to do that. That grant is ring-fenced to that purpose.
Suzy Davies AM: Could you give us an idea of the price tag?
Jo-Anne Daniels: At the moment, it's about PS2. 5 million.
Suzy Davies AM: Okay, just as a round figure--that's fine.
Nicola Edwards: Just for the administration. They get separate funding for the childcare, obviously.
Suzy Davies AM: Okay, thank you.
Jo-Anne Daniels: So that, as I said, is a ring-fenced sum that they use to administer the offer. We are now starting the detailed work to define the new system requirements so that we will have a single application process across Wales, moving forward. As part of that work, we'll need to consider the detailed costings, but our initial estimate suggests that it would be less than the cost proposed by HMRC.
Suzy Davies AM: Okay, when those costings are worked up, perhaps we could have a note comparing the two figures.
Jo-Anne Daniels: Yes, we would be very happy to share more detail on that.
Suzy Davies AM: Thank you.
Lynne Neagle AM: Sian.
Sian Gwenllian AM: If it became a universal offer, would those costs reduce? Would there be so much bureaucracy involved in checking eligibility and stuff if every child was open to the offer?
Jo-Anne Daniels: So, clearly, if every child is eligible, then a large part of the process falls away in terms of the need to verify income and so on. That doesn't mean that there's no administration. For example, with the foundation phase, which is universally available, there is an application process and there is an administrative function that sits alongside that. At this point in time, I couldn't give you any indication of--
Sian Gwenllian AM: But it would be substantially less, wouldn't it, because they wouldn't have to do all these eligibility checks and all those things?
Nicola Edwards: They wouldn't have to do the eligibility checks, but they would still have to make payments to the childcare providers and make sure they were paying for the right number of hours in respect of each child. So, parents would still need to tell them where their child was going, and there would still need to be some work alongside that.
Lynne Neagle AM: Okay. Sian, do you want to ask about the Welsh language?
Sian Gwenllian AM: I think we've--. I'm happy with that.
Lynne Neagle AM: Really--?
Sian Gwenllian AM: I don't think that that was the real reason why the change happened.
Julie Morgan AM: One of the reasons.
Lynne Neagle AM: Nevertheless, the committee was given very concrete assurances that the Welsh language side of this was going to be covered off. Have you got anything that you want to add on that? Obviously, for us as a committee, we believe what we're told when we are given assurances. So, that's quite concerning for us, really, that that suddenly then became an issue, when both HMRC and the Minister at the time told us that this wasn't going to be a problem.
Nicola Edwards: So, I think it's the point that I was talking about earlier. There's a difference between a bilingual service in the context of what HMRC understood that to be, in the context of their scheme, and the very detail of the standards when they got into their IT systems.
Lynne Neagle AM: Shouldn't that have been something that was worked out at the beginning?
Nicola Edwards: Possibly, but they did need to do quite detailed work, not just into their own IT systems, but the feed-in systems from the Home Office, the Department for Work and Pensions and the Post Office as well, to understand the full complexity of how the standards would comply across all of that. They do provide a bilingual service. It was just some of the specific details of the requirements placed on the Welsh Ministers, because it is the Welsh Ministers'standards that they would need to deliver against that they were struggling with.
Lynne Neagle AM: Right, okay.
Sian Gwenllian AM: Yes, but those standards were there right from the very beginning.
Lynne Neagle AM: I think that the committee would feel that that should have been bottomed out at the beginning, really.
Sian Gwenllian AM: Nothing has changed in terms of the standards.
Lynne Neagle AM: Okay, just before we move on to Flying Start, can I just ask: the Minister mentioned a longer term review of the childcare offer. Are you able to give us any indication of when that will report, please?
Julie Morgan AM: Would we have any idea?
Nicola Edwards: We haven't set out a definitive timescale on that as of yet because we've been focusing very much on getting the review in terms of training, education and on the cusp of returning to work up and running. But sometime next year.
Lynne Neagle AM: Okay. So, it will report sometime next year.
Nicola Edwards: Yes.
Lynne Neagle AM: Okay, thank you. We'll move on now to Flying Start and questions from Suzy Davies.
Suzy Davies AM: Thank you, Chair. Can I just begin by asking you how you respond to the assertion that children from the most disadvantaged backgrounds do better in a mixed socioeconomic environment than in a targeted environment?
Julie Morgan AM: I think that's what Flying Start does, isn't it? Yes, I would have thought that was likely.
Suzy Davies AM: Well, the reason I'm asking you that, of course, is because this committee has suggested, perhaps, changes to the outreach system to target more disadvantaged children, and not necessarily capture people who happen to be in a geographic area.
Julie Morgan AM: So, you're saying that you feel that a universal offer in certain areas is not advantageous to--
Suzy Davies AM: Well, I'm asking you, really. If it's the case that we're only going after disadvantaged children, which would take very precise targeting--
Julie Morgan AM: I'm not only going after disadvantaged children. I feel that we should be offering something for all children, and our considerations are for all children. The reason we've targeted Flying Start is because it would be great if we had enough money to have Flying Start throughout the whole of Wales, but we just don't have that sort of money. Because I think Flying Start has proved to be a great--very successful.
Suzy Davies AM: I'm going to ask you a few more questions on that. Because just in response to this committee's 2018 report, you did say that:'defined geographical targeting of Flying Start support will be considered as part of the Welsh Government's work on the Early Years system.'That suggests you still have geographic targeting in mind. So, if you're looking at a very mixed source of economic experience for children, what are the geographic boundaries you're considering?
Julie Morgan AM: At the moment, Flying Start can go beyond the geographical boundaries, with the extension--
Suzy Davies AM: With limits, yes.
Julie Morgan AM: Yes. I think they can use 10 per cent of their income to go beyond the geographical boundaries, and many of them have done that. But, obviously, there are four elements to Flying Start, and only those geographical areas have got the four elements, but there could be the opportunity of extending some of that beyond the Flying Start geographical areas. We're looking at this.
Suzy Davies AM: I accept what you say about the current system--
Julie Morgan AM: I believe it's much more--. I believe very strongly in having a universal system, where everybody is able to access it.
Suzy Davies AM: I appreciate that as well. But, obviously, there are huge cost implications for that--unless you're giving us some insight into what you're going to say next week, I don't know. But actually, defining anything geographically, which now seems to be fairly arbitrary, because it's not targeted purely at disadvantaged children--on what basis are we choosing the geographic areas we are choosing at the moment?
Julie Morgan AM: Well, they're chosen then because of the benefit take-up in those particular areas. So, it's reaching some of the poorest children, but not all of the poorest children, but it's reaching the poorest children in a way that is not stigmatising, and where the services are open to everybody, and I think that's very important.
Suzy Davies AM: Okay. Well, having established that, we have fairly recent research here that a third of children living in poverty in Wales are already falling behind at the age of five--that suggests that two thirds of them aren't, but it's still a very worrying statistic. Not all children live in Flying Start areas; how are you going to reach that third who, even at such an early age, are already falling behind? How many of them are in Flying Start areas?
Julie Morgan AM: I think the actual number of children in poverty, the most disadvantaged that we reach through the Flying Start areas--I think it's about 46 per cent. Is that--? Do you know the actual percentage?
Suzy Davies AM: It's about a quarter of total children are in there, but--
Jo-Anne Daniels: So, just to give you a few of the numbers, there are just over 36,000 children benefiting from Flying Start services. That equates to about 23 per cent of children, overall, in Wales. And because of the nature of the benefit take-up data, and because we don't assess eligibility within a Flying Start area, we can't be absolutely certain how many children within a Flying Start area are actually in poverty. So, it's an estimate, and it's a range, and the range is that around 45 per cent of children in Flying Start areas would be in poverty. FootnoteLink
Suzy Davies AM: Well, that's interesting. I would have expected it to be much higher than that, particularly if the geographic areas had been targeted on benefit claims, effectively. Are you disappointed that the proportion is--basically, 55 per cent of those children aren't living in poverty. That's what you're saying, isn't it?
Jo-Anne Daniels: Well, I'd offer two observations. One: the nature of poverty in Wales is actually, generally, more dispersed than perhaps sometimes is appreciated. Yes, we have very concentrated areas of--
Suzy Davies AM: Well, actually, we do appreciate it, which is why we're asking this question. [Laughter. ]
Jo-Anne Daniels: Okay. So that's one issue to think about. Sorry, I've lost my train of thought now, in terms of the second--oh, sorry: whether you're in or out of poverty is, in one sense, very black/white. But in reality of course--in terms of the income definition, it's very black/white. But, of course, there will be a large number of people who are just above, but also families who move in and out, so it's quite a transient population in some senses, in terms of people having incomes that aren't stable, people having jobs that go with that that aren't stable. So, at any one point in time, you're only sort of capturing a snapshot of what's happening. In reality, it's a bit more complex than that.
Suzy Davies AM: I accept that. I mentioned a third of children living in poverty had fallen behind at five; by the age of 14, half that number is still falling behind, so something has happened between that third and that half to improve the life chances of those individual children or young people. Is that attributable to Flying Start? Can you say that candidly? Or is it a happy coincidence, where there could be some causation, but we can't prove it?
Jo-Anne Daniels: We certainly think that Flying Start is making a positive impact, both on the point at which children go to school, and then subsequently. And I think as the committee knows, we've been working with the SAIL--secure anonymised information linkage--and the databank there to look at how we can do longitudinal studies to track children's progress, to look at the extent to which outcomes are effected by Flying Start interventions.
Suzy Davies AM: We probably don't have time for this level of detail today, but half of those children are still behind at the age of 14. So, I'd be curious to know if there's any immediate plans to help them catch up or make sure that their successors don't fall into the same position, the same trap. Have you got anything high level that you can mention at this stage?
Julie Morgan AM: Just in terms of what we're thinking of doing with Flying Start--. The key thing about Flying Start is the collaborative way that it works with the health visitors and all the speech and language therapists and childcare, and we're looking at ways of trying to get some of those elements to reach a wider group. And as I said, we talked about earlier the eight earlier years transformation pathfinders that we talked about in the local authorities--we talked about that earlier--so, that's where we're going to look at Flying Start and how we can try to make it more accessible to more children. So, we do want to extend the benefits of Flying Start. We do want to make it available to more children, and that's what we're looking at. And we're looking at that in those eight pathfinder areas. And you'll have to wait to see what we come up with--
Suzy Davies AM: No, no--we'll ask you more about that in due course. Actually, that job would be an awful lot easier if you knew how many children within Flying Start areas were taking up all four elements. Why don't you know that? Why is that data not collected?
Julie Morgan AM: Do we know why?
Jo-Anne Daniels: So, the approach that we've taken to evaluation in Flying Start--. The committee will have seen the various evaluation reports that have been published, and I know that you're familiar with the work that, as I say, we've been doing with SAIL. We're currently focusing on individual data collection, and through that we want to be able to report on levels of engagement, but also outcomes for children. We've been piloting that new approach in six local authorities. We hope to be able to extend that, and we hope to be able to provide more evidence about the interventions and the impact that they then achieve.
Suzy Davies AM: Okay. All right. Because, to be honest, I would want to know if a child's chances have improved primarily because they're getting good-quality childcare or primarily because their parents are taking up parenting courses. There's got to be some indication somewhere in here about which of these four elements is making the greatest difference.
Jo-Anne Daniels: I would just caution in terms of expectations. It will always be quite difficult to definitively provide answers to that, because many parents will be taking these things up in combination. So, disentangling which has had the effect is, obviously, quite tricky--in particular, all parents will be getting the enhanced health visiting. Not every parent will take up parenting support, not every child will need speech and language help, so--
Suzy Davies AM: And that's why we need to know who is.
Jo-Anne Daniels: Disentangling what's helped and what hasn't I think will always be quite a difficult thing to do.
Suzy Davies AM: But it would also be helpful to know which combinations work best as well. Just on the final point from me--yes, 88 per cent of Flying Start's childcare offers were taken up, but we've had some local authorities where the take-up has dropped dramatically. I think Denbighshire was down a fair bit, wasn't it, and Ceredigion, I think, had had a poor take-up. Have you got any indication why? I'm thinking of Denbighshire particularly, where there is a tradition--taking up third-party childcare is cultural there, whereas in Ceredigion, for example, there are far fewer places available in the first place and less of a tradition of children taking up childcare. But what's happened in Denbighshire?
Julie Morgan AM: I think there are a number of different reasons why parents do decide not to use a facility, and, obviously, that always exists, but each local authority has a Flying Start account manager in place to support them in the delivery of the programme and the account management activities, and there are formal account meetings that look at this sort of thing once a year--
Suzy Davies AM: So, what have they told you?
Julie Morgan AM: --and these meetings will take place in November 2019. That's when the specific delivery issues will be discussed in depth, so that's when we'll find out what has happened and why there may have been a drop.
Suzy Davies AM: Can I just ask about the timing of that? Because if you already know that there's a 6 per cent drop, why will it take the best part of a year to--well, November's only next month, to be fair, now, but why will it take that length of time to establish why there's a drop? You'd have thought if you'd seen a trend like that--
Julie Morgan AM: Obviously, they meet at certain times and they will assess what's happened. That seems quite normal to me.
Suzy Davies AM: Okay, but we'll get a note on that, is it? It's just that they knew this six months ago.
Julie Morgan AM: In November, we'll have more information about this, so we can let you have information about that.
Suzy Davies AM: That would be really helpful, just for--. I'm sure constituents in Denbighshire will want to know about that. And then finally from me, Chair, if I may, Flying Start beneficiaries--it's got a specific explanation of what a Flying Start beneficiary is, but I think, particularly in view of the evidence we've heard on this committee about parental support in connection with the removal of the defence of reasonable chastisement, for example, this committee is very concerned about what's out there in terms of parental support. Eighteen per cent of Flying Start beneficiaries have parents attending the informal parenting courses; that's 18 per cent, that's not very high. Any idea about what you might be able to do to encourage take-up or is that very locally decided?
Lynne Neagle AM: If I can add to that, obviously, somebody only has to attend one course--we've got no way of knowing whether parents are completing the whole of a course, really.
Julie Morgan AM: Obviously, the offer is there for parents to take up the parenting courses, and there are four elements to Flying Start, and maybe some of the parents don't feel that they want to or need to. I don't think we've got any more evidence on that for take-up--
Suzy Davies AM: Well, the reach of this is going to be important, because we need the reassurance on the back of the legislation that is going through at the moment.
Julie Morgan AM: Absolutely, yes.
Jo-Anne Daniels: Parenting courses are, of course, one aspect of parenting support, but not the only one, and they'll be appropriate for a lot of parents, but for some not. What all parents do get at an enhanced level in Flying Start is the support of the health visitor, so the health visitor is, in effect, providing a significant amount of support for parenting. Now, that can be practical things like weaning or potty training et cetera, but, actually, it's also about managing a child's behaviour, managing how a parent develops that bonding and that attachment with their child. So, the role of the health visitor in supporting a parent to be a parent is absolutely critical, and every parent in Flying Start areas will be getting that enhanced level of support. Of course, it's not just in Flying Start areas now, because with the Healthy Child Wales programme, the universal programme of health visiting visits, we have a much more consistent and standardised set of visits and engagements with parents that cover a lot of these areas. In addition, I'd also add that when parents use the childcare in Flying Start, or childcare generally outside of Flying Start areas, there is often a lot of working between the childcare setting and the parent over parenting--again, managing a child's behaviour, managing any issues that the childcare worker thinks are emerging in terms of whether it's eating or, again, toileting. So, parenting courses are important, but it's really essential that we see those in the broader context of the different ways in which lots of professionals interact with parents, providing them with advice, guidance and support, and actually what works for parents in terms of how they take on board some of that advice and that help. Sometimes a formal course is quite off-putting for parents, but the sort of quiet word, the top tips, the advice that a friendly professional gives can be very, very impactful.
Suzy Davies AM: That's a really helpful answer. It does raise, unfortunately, another question about whether a health visitor in those circumstances might find themselves in a difficult position if they're dealing with a parent who has smacked a child, but we'll leave that for Stage 3.
Julie Morgan AM: We'll be dealing with that, I'm sure.
Suzy Davies AM: But thank you; that was a helpful answer. Thank you, Chair.
Lynne Neagle AM: Okay. Thank you. Are there any other questions from Members? No. Okay. Well, can I thank the Minister and the officials for attending this morning? As usual, you'll be sent a transcript to check for accuracy following the meeting, but thank you again for your attendance. Thank you.
Julie Morgan AM: Thank you very much.
Lynne Neagle AM: Okay. Item 4 is papers to note. There's just one today: the letter from the WLGA regarding the Childcare Funding (Wales) Act 2019 in response to our letter asking about the change in approach. Item 5 then. Can I propose, in accordance with Standing Order 17. 42, that the committee resolves to meet in private for the remainder of the meeting? Are Members content? Thank you.","Julie Morgan recommended to believe the demand was very important, and to establish a specific programme to develop Welsh language skills in childcare and played workforce with the National Centre for Learning Welsh to develop workplace Welsh language skills across the sector. And also she agreed on Nicola Edwards's idea that they should have a stakeholder group where they had brought together a variety of people with an interest in the early years, childcare and play sectors.",qmsum
"Summarize the whole meeting.
Project Manager: So we come to the third meetings. I have {gap} good.
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Um so in the last meeting we have discussed the functional design and now we will talk about the conceptual design. So we will talk about some specific details.
Industrial Designer: Okay so I think I will do my presentation on the components concept so can you please uh open uh {disfmarker} I'm participant two.
Project Manager: This {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Components design.
Project Manager: {gap}
Industrial Designer: Okay so uh the first thing uh I have done is to to made a review together with the uh manufactural uh department and have which components was uh available to build a remote control. So for energy sources we have we have to choose between the solar energy, hand dynamo and uh kinetic um well uh kinetic uh technique {vocalsound} to to store the energy.
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: We also um {vocalsound} we also can put a regular battery in the in the remote control. Now {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Uh this is what we have decided in the last meeting. But if we use battery {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Yeah b uh f well uh I meant uh by by battery I meant uh I will not have a uh a wire between the remote control and the energy source but uh I didn't fou we didn't decide yet which kind of battery we will put inside the the remote. So uh it's a point to discuss. Then uh the case material we have uh uh also several choices, like wood, rubber, titanium or latex. {vocalsound} But uh well it's not a a re uh well a real issue for the {vocalsound} {disfmarker} from the technical uh point of view. Concerning the interface uh we can we can put mm just simple buttons or scrolls or buttons uh much more complicated, but it also requires that the chip to process the button is more complicated so.
User Interface: Mm.
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} And uh this is the last point, the choice of chips. So what I have f found is that I think basic battery or kinetic uh energy uh collection is the is the better way to provide energy because I think solar energy wi won't work {vocalsound} in a cluttered uh {vocalsound} uh environment.
User Interface: Mm.
Industrial Designer: So um so I think we can start with these two main things. For the case uh well uh I think that uh titanium is um is a good choice because it's trendy and it's uh it's uh well it's modern and uh user are are are {disfmarker} mm will be uh very happy to have a {vocalsound} a a nice remote. For the interface uh I think that we can ach achieve uh all the desired functionalities by s just uh using uh rubber buttons, simple buttons and th thus this allow to use a regular chip {vocalsound} that are uh well cheaper. {vocalsound}
User Interface: Mm.
Industrial Designer: And s so uh we can move to the next slide.
User Interface: Sorry.
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
User Interface: What is this single curved {disfmarker} what does it mean?
Industrial Designer: Well uh uh i i it's uh it's the the shape of the um of the remote.
User Interface: So it's it's not {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: You you will have the {disfmarker} well um the the curve will fit into your hand when you grab the {disfmarker}
User Interface: Yo l yeah. When you hold on it, it is comfortable to hold.
Industrial Designer: Yeah. It's more confog f comfortable that if these uh it's completely flat.
User Interface: Okay. Yeah. And the battery, is it kind of a rechargeable or it doesn't matter?
Industrial Designer: Yeah the um that's the point. The kinetic one is uh y you can recharge uh by the um {disfmarker}
User Interface: That that's what it means by kinetic.
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} Yeah and by {disfmarker} well by just by moving the ar uh your arm the mm well the remote will uh accumulate energy.
User Interface: Okay. Mm-hmm. Okay.
Industrial Designer: But I d I don't know it's {disfmarker} if it is feasible because I don't know if yet if if the user will move enough to provide the remote um all the necessary energy.
User Interface: Mm. {vocalsound} Mm. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. We we might check with our R_ and D_ department to see if they have this product {vocalsound} ready for market. {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: Yeah. {vocalsound} And {disfmarker} yeah and so can you go to the next slide please. So and uh that's uh that summarize well what I have said.
User Interface: Mm mm. {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Wha
Industrial Designer: So uh you're right we can uh see in our uh R_ and D_ uh {vocalsound} if the kinetic metal is sufficient to provide enough energy.
User Interface: Ah the department. Mm.
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} That's it.
User Interface: Uh {disfmarker} So I um keep in touch with the R_ and D_ department.
Industrial Designer: Oh yeah
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: I take care, it's all right.
User Interface: {vocalsound} So the titanium case is the normal case that {disfmarker} I'll show you some pictures that I have and you tell me whether they are titanium case or not.
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} All right. Yeah.
User Interface:'Cause I am not very sure, plastic, titanium or whatever. There's another point I want to make, is that the uh {disfmarker} well you've seen them I le na my presentation that um I point out some {disfmarker} why buttons are not the mm not the only ways you can {vocalsound} use {disfmarker} Yeah. Yeah, maybe n
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: We will, okay.
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Three.
User Interface: Yeah. {vocalsound} So the user interface is uh i it uses the aspect uh of a computer system, a programme which can be seen or heard or otherwise perceived by the human user
Project Manager: {gap}
User Interface: and the commands and mechanism the user uses to control its operation and input data. So you s this gives you the ways to input data and we have uh {disfmarker} we are more {disfmarker} we emphasise more on the graphical user interface here. The idea is to represent buttons as figures, diagrams, symbols and on so you you can easily when you look at the symbols you understand what it is doing.
Project Manager: What's the function of this button.
User Interface: Yeah. Yeah. So.
Project Manager: I think it makes the the interface really {disfmarker}
User Interface: Ea easy to use. So next one.
Project Manager: Graphical user interface {gap}.
User Interface: {gap} function five. So I can use the button, the mouse maybe.
Project Manager: A graphical user interface emphasise the use of pictures.
User Interface: Yeah. So next line. So the {disfmarker} here are some examples. So they cluster the buttons together. They group them into col they colour them and uh they have different forms as well. Mm but this interface are kind of confusing. Uh basically there are too many buttons. Right. Next one.
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
User Interface: So some people are propose voice recognition and so {disfmarker} ah by the way I receive an email from the from one our departments saying that the voice recognition has been used in the coffee machine {vocalsound} for this by a company
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
User Interface: when you tell the {disfmarker} you say good morning coffee machine and the machine are reply to you. So I just got an email saying that.
Industrial Designer: Mm-hmm mm mm.
User Interface: And it seems like this voice recognition technology is ready to be used so we might consider that, supposedly.
Industrial Designer: Yeah fine.
User Interface: {vocalsound} The next one. Mm so somebody {disfmarker} some people use uh some people use a spinning wheel th with the L_C_ display so instead of using the mm buttons you have a L_C_D_ screen and then there you can u you can use that as buttons, you can use that as real {disfmarker} so so that could be an option as well. Touch screen, I mean.
Project Manager: Yeah.
User Interface: Next one. And some people propose a scroll button. Integrated with push buttons or you may have scroll button instead of p just the push button. Like the one we have here. Uh, next one. So mm
Project Manager: Mm-hmm.
User Interface: so there are a few aspects that I collected here. So s basically this deals with special users, children, handicapped people, old people, and uh mm and prog basically they are programmable, specially for children. And uh mm {disfmarker} yeah yeah. And then they also secure uh covers, to protect uh secure and hidden programming and battery covers that will protect your settings. So {disfmarker} But we don't have to integrate all these complicated features. I'm just saying that the {disfmarker} currently in the market there are there are control there are remote controllers f {gap} customisable for different people. Yeah, so that's the point. The next one. And uh you see this is the one where you have the protection cover. Mm maybe useful for children, they migh you you they only see the buttons outside. And for adults wh where you have more control you can see the one inside. So the adults might wanna have a key to lock that to pr so children will not touch the button inside.
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
User Interface: Yeah.
Industrial Designer: S a good idea.
User Interface: The next one.
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
User Interface: So this guy {disfmarker} this is another company that provides big buttons. At {disfmarker} I see that that is useful for old people and then you don't get it lost. But for our product we don't need a big one because you have voice recognition e eventually with use.
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
User Interface: And you can call your remote controller if you don't know where it is.
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
User Interface: {vocalsound} T_V_ remote controller where are you?
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
User Interface: And then, he will beeps and to say that I am here, {vocalsound} for example.
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: {gap} We should include speech synthesis in this case, no?
User Interface: Is it possible?
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
Marketing: Yeah.
User Interface: Uh? {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: Yeah but uh as Norman say if uh there is uh already a commercial product available who t who do this we we can check uh to integrate it i into our uh new remote control.
Marketing: Yeah.
User Interface: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And uh, this is another one where you can uh {disfmarker} the the the part that's a V_ standing for the volume. So there's a up arrow and a down arrow. But you the see that in the V_, the V_ appears to be the down arrow on the top {disfmarker} on the top up arrow {disfmarker} {vocalsound} if you {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Mm-hmm.
User Interface: up arrow there's a V_ like as as if it's turning down so it's confusing interface, so I wanna avoid this kind of thing in the design.
Industrial Designer: Yeah yeah.
User Interface: And here are {disfmarker} is uh here is a s short summary that I summary that I compiled after the findings I found. Big buttons are convenient, voice recognition helps, push buttons, scroll buttons, spinning wheels can be used as navigation tools. And uh user customisable is important and finally simplicity simplicity is the key. Yeah. So {vocalsound} we have many concepts there
Industrial Designer: Hmm. {vocalsound}
User Interface: but we have to choose later on which ones are important to be used.
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
User Interface: And basically uh {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Well I {vocalsound} I think you it's it's it's fine you have uh reviewed all all the possibilities
User Interface: Yeah.
Industrial Designer: but uh uh well uh i if we consider that uh the user interface is displayed on the T_V_ screen I don't think we nee uh we need much buttons in the remote
Project Manager: {gap}
User Interface: Mm-hmm.
Industrial Designer: since we we just have to navigate and to have a okay or enter key or things like that,
User Interface: Yeah. Mm.
Industrial Designer: because uh adding wheels or scrolls uh makes the thing more complicated and more expensive also, so.
User Interface: Mm. Okay.
Project Manager: Or maybe we can include the user manual in the in the remote control {gap} and we should have just a button like help and you say uh and you ik you press the button help and maybe you see the the user m might in the in the T_V_.
Industrial Designer: Yeah. That's a good idea.
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: To have a help button.
User Interface: A help button.
Project Manager: Yeah.
User Interface: So you are display on the screen.
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
Project Manager: On T_V_ T_V_ screen.
User Interface: So {disfmarker} on the T_V_ screen.
Industrial Designer: On the T_V_ screen. On the T_V_ screen the uh how to use your remote.
Project Manager: So just you push the button
User Interface: Okay. Okay. Okay.
Project Manager: and we will {disfmarker}
Marketing: Oh.
User Interface: So that eliminates all the complicated documentation {gap},
Project Manager: Yeah.
User Interface: okay. So wi
Marketing: But people are often enough looking at the help,
Project Manager: If the if {disfmarker}
Marketing: once they see the help button they say oh this is a complicated stuff.
Project Manager: {vocalsound} No {vocalsound} In the case where they need help, in the case where they need help.
Industrial Designer: Uh yeah. {vocalsound}
Marketing: {vocalsound} It's a psychology.
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} In a marketing point of view.
Marketing: {vocalsound} Okay.
User Interface: Yeah.
Marketing: And let us see what the market demands.
Project Manager: Yeah.
Marketing: We could just go to my presentation.
Industrial Designer: But {disfmarker} uh wel well I think {disfmarker}
Project Manager: It's just for user customizable, for kids or old people.
Marketing: Yeah that's right.
User Interface: Mm.
Project Manager: So {disfmarker}
Marketing: I mean it just showed us the remote with an cap which could be used for kids and if you remove the {disfmarker}
Project Manager: So it's the same {disfmarker}
Marketing: Same remote with some {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Can be used by both kids and old people.
Marketing: Both yeah.
User Interface: Mm. {vocalsound} Well uh what I s propose is that uh you know a remote controller, i {vocalsound} it could be a cube,
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
User Interface: is uh a small device that uh looks like a cube and maybe you can just change the {vocalsound} um the buttons, if you ch turn one side you get one one buttons, you turn the other side you get the other buttons, so for maybe new generation people who get used to the computer they want lots of controls. {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Maybe for kids, kids they like uh t no l they like to {disfmarker}
User Interface: Small {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Uh well.
User Interface: Yeah.
Industrial Designer: So le le let's see what uh what {vocalsound} people want.
User Interface: Let's see the market demand.
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
Marketing: And then we can decide what what we can {disfmarker} yeah.
User Interface: What what {gap} market {disfmarker} yes yes.
Project Manager: {gap}
Marketing: So we just made an marketing survey of what people need from our remotes and how it could be special from the other remotes. And we got the best on the responses from the questionnaires. Uh we also have some prizes for the most creative solutions. And we found the following solutions which we could {disfmarker} which would be helpful for our design. So seventy percent of the users, they find their remote controls very ugly, they don't find it pleasant to use in the size or usage or anything. And eighty percent of the people they are always l I mean they are willing to spend more money if the remote control would look fancy. And the current remote controls do not match well the operating behaviour of the user. And seventy five percent of the users said they zap a lot.
Project Manager: Yeah. {vocalsound}
Marketing: And fifty percent say they use only ten percent of the buttons,
Project Manager: Mm-hmm.
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
Marketing: so the rest of the ninety percent of the buttons they're not used most of the times.
User Interface: Yeah. Yes.
Marketing: So this were the findings which we found. And also they cited frustrations with the present remote controls. Most of {disfmarker} fifty percent of the time the remote controls are lost somewhere in the room and people are always searching for them {vocalsound} rather than watching the T_V_.
User Interface: Yeah.
Marketing: And by the time they found the remote control the program is finished.
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
Marketing: So {vocalsound} they're frustrated a lot {vocalsound}
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Marketing: And um if the remote control is too complicated it takes much time to learn the functionality of it.
User Interface: Mm.
Industrial Designer: Mm, the functionalities yeah.
Marketing: So you can just see the percentage, fifty percent people they responded that they always lose their remotes and thirty four percent they say that it's quite difficult to learn if it's too complex.
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} Yeah.
Marketing: So keeping in view all these findings and the frustrations I think this should be the solution for them. We should have an L_C_D_ on the rem remote control.
User Interface: Oh.
Industrial Designer: Well mm w well I I I don't really see the advantage of having uh L_C_D_ on the on the remote control if we have a a a big screen and uh display on the screen.
User Interface: Big screen.
Industrial Designer: It's {disfmarker}
Marketing: Mm-hmm?
Industrial Designer: yeah of course it's fancy trendy and so on but it's it's expensive to produce {vocalsound} and it's not really {disfmarker}
Marketing: I mean as our survey says that people are willing to pay more if their remotes are fancy.
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
Marketing: So if we have a L_C_D_ on the remote, rather than looking onto the T_V_ you just look into a remote and navigate it. It's the same menu as we have saw that iPod remote control.
User Interface: Mm yeah.
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} Yeah yeah.
User Interface: Mm. The thing {vocalsound} {disfmarker}
Marketing: We just {vocalsound} play around
Industrial Designer: Yeah but when you play with the iPod you don't have {vocalsound} a big screen in front of you, s
Project Manager: You can use this screen instead of the big se screen,
User Interface: Yeah. Yeah.
Marketing: Yeah.
User Interface: Yeah.
Project Manager: instead of use the {disfmarker} yeah.
User Interface: If you re-use the existing screen, we element {disfmarker} eliminate the L_C_D_, after all the L_C_D_ just to display
Project Manager: Hmm.
User Interface: and if you have the colourful screen you can make the display colourful, fancy, as fancy as the one on the L_C_D_,
Marketing: Yeah.
User Interface: maybe even better.
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
User Interface: So {disfmarker}
Marketing: I mean this were the points which we got from the market demands.
User Interface: Yeah.
Industrial Designer: Yeah. Yeah yeah.
User Interface: Yeah.
Marketing: So
Industrial Designer: So I th I I {vocalsound} well I think we we can focus on the uh on the fancy look on the uh
User Interface: Yeah. More on a fancy design.
Marketing: {vocalsound} Yeah that's fine.
Industrial Designer: on the speech recognition if the technology is available
Marketing: Yeah. I mean that's {disfmarker}
User Interface: {vocalsound} Yeah.
Industrial Designer: but well I think L_C_D_ will uh will uh make us spend a lot of money for not so big results.
User Interface: Mm. Remember we have a s budget for the cost of producing the remote controller.
Marketing: Mm-hmm.
Project Manager: But {disfmarker} Yeah.
User Interface: Yeah. So i is {disfmarker}
Marketing: Uh yeah we have uh {disfmarker}
Project Manager: {gap}
User Interface: so the thing is you can find out how much an L_C_D_ will cost and then we'll decide again. {vocalsound}
Marketing: {vocalsound} I mean that should be found out by the Industrial Designers. {vocalsound}
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
User Interface: Uh maybe you can find out the price and tell us next time {gap}. Is i if i
Industrial Designer: So price of uh L_C_D_ display.
User Interface: Yeah.
Industrial Designer: And {disfmarker}
Marketing: And it's always good to have an voice recognition for the remote controls.
User Interface: Yeah. And also the cost for the speech recognition.
Project Manager: Mm. It's for {disfmarker}
User Interface: Ask our R_ and D_ department.
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
Project Manager: it's just for small vocabulary. We {disfmarker} it's not {disfmarker}
User Interface: Yeah.
Marketing: Yeah it's o only for a limited vocabulary,
Project Manager: yeah.
User Interface: Yeah. And ho
Marketing: say eighty commands or so.
Project Manager: Yeah.
User Interface: Yeah.
Industrial Designer: Yeah okay.
User Interface: And also the scroller button, how much will it cost. {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: And {disfmarker} Well uh compared to the to s the simpl simpler simplest button.
Project Manager: {vocalsound} Yeah. Push push {gap}.
Marketing: Mm, the scroll button, {gap} from the survey we never see that people would like to have some scrolling button.
Industrial Designer: Yeah. Yeah I think that {disfmarker}
Marketing: Because they they just they're just frightened to use the scrollings or {vocalsound} help button.
User Interface: Yeah.
Industrial Designer: Yeah I I I think that uh well uh as we have seen in the in the presentation uh well uh about uh uh fifty percent of the of the percent n choose the button
User Interface: Don't use the buttons.
Industrial Designer: so uh I think to have uh five uh simple button is sufficient for our functionality.
User Interface: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
Project Manager: It doesn't mean that the other buttons are not necessary or important.
Marketing: Yeah. {vocalsound}
User Interface: Important.
Industrial Designer: Yeah. But {disfmarker}
Project Manager: But they are just less used compar
Marketing: They're not used much.
Project Manager: yeah.
Industrial Designer: But the uh the thing is is i is that we can add a functionality on the on the T_V_ screen
User Interface: Yeah.
Industrial Designer: like uh a a list of function
User Interface: Yeah. Mm.
Industrial Designer: and then you choose with the with the button to {disfmarker} well you navigate
User Interface: Yeah, yeah. So so the at most {disfmarker} more power uh.
Industrial Designer: and you {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Or maybe we can u uh or maybe we can uh make this the ten percent of button more bigger than the others.
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
Project Manager: So.
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: But if i i if we if we could have a a a display uh g a user interface that is very complete on the T_V_ screen {vocalsound} I think that just five buttons are sufficient,
User Interface: Yep.
Industrial Designer: one to go up left right down and uh enter
User Interface: Yeah.
Industrial Designer: and you you you just select the functionality you want to access or things like that.
User Interface: Mm. Mm. Yeah.
Industrial Designer: You don't have to to switch to a channel to another uh {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Mm.
User Interface: Yeah.
Marketing: Or it could be like this, as the people say, if they have a L_C_D_ on the remote not on the television. Because when you have the L_C_D_ onto the television screen you miss the picture in the background, we are most focused on the commands.
Industrial Designer: Yeah but {disfmarker}
Marketing: So if you have then L_C_D_ in the remote, you just have a menu, and increasing and lower these signs here to change the programs and this menu when you press the menu, in the L_C_D_ displays as you go on pressing the menu it faster displays volume, then the program, then the brightness, contrast and all the stuff.
User Interface: Mm.
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} {gap} Yeah but if you look at the L_C_D_ you you don't look at the T_V_ screen
Marketing: And accordingly you can just increase or decrease.
Project Manager: It's {disfmarker}
User Interface: Mm. Mm.
Industrial Designer: so {vocalsound} i i it's not really worth to get {disfmarker} to have the image if you don't look at, so.
User Interface: I if {disfmarker} Mm. Mm.
Project Manager: And I think it's increases the cost of the the remote control if you use L_C_D_. I {disfmarker}
User Interface: Yeah.
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
Marketing: Yeah that has to be checked out.
User Interface: I think that there's no contradiction here, because if there are few buttons, you don't have to look at your your controller any more because you know where the buttons are, so if you wanna control the screen d sh sharpness you just say sharpness
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
User Interface: and then you t turn {disfmarker} you just press lef increase or decrease button
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
User Interface: and the same for the volume and the channel, {vocalsound}
Marketing: Yeah.
User Interface: if you had the speech recognition there you just shout your channel, just tell your channel and then you don't even have to look at the butto at the controller so finally that wil eliminates the the need for L_C_D_,
Marketing: Okay.
User Interface: with the help of speech recogniser you can {disfmarker}
Marketing: I mean, {gap} better if we could just check all the cost with L_C_D_
User Interface: Yeah.
Marketing: and also with the speech recognition.
User Interface: Mm.
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
Marketing: And then we could find which would would be a more suitable in this case.
User Interface: Mm. Mm. {vocalsound} Yeah. A and {disfmarker}
Marketing: And the third problem was to find the remote control. Always, so fifty percent of the people say they lose the remotes.
Industrial Designer: Well so we we can think about a well a a vocal command like uh find
User Interface: Mm.
Industrial Designer: and {vocalsound} when the remote control uh hears fine well yeah just uh to make him beep or t
Project Manager: You will listen to a peep, {vocalsound} special peep.
User Interface: Where {gap}, yeah.
Marketing: {vocalsound} Yeah that's right, that's exactly what I mean by voice commander.
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
Marketing: Or it could be also something like this,
User Interface: Yeah.
Marketing: uh it's always boring to change the batteries of the remotes control,
User Interface: Mm.
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
Marketing: so we have some one charger there and whenever we don't use the remote control we put it in the charger.
User Interface: Put it back at the charge.
Industrial Designer: Put {disfmarker}
User Interface: Yeah.
Marketing: And when we're using that t remote and if we misplace somewhere, in the charger we have a small button, and just by pressing the button in the charger the uh remote control beeps, wherever it is.
Project Manager: Okay.
User Interface: Yeah.
Industrial Designer: Yeah. And that's a good idea, that's simple, like in phones.
Project Manager: Yeah.
User Interface: Mm.
Marketing: I mean it doe it also doesn't require a voice command,
Project Manager: But you don't you don't have to move the the charger.
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
Marketing: because there are problems with a voice command.
User Interface: Hmm. Mm. {vocalsound} Th yeah. Mm yeah. Yeah. Mm.
Marketing: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Project Manager: You have to keep it {gap}.
Marketing: I mean charger would be fixed
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
Marketing: because it's always with electricity plugged.
Industrial Designer: Yeah if there if there uh there is nuff not enough battery. Also and uh uh the remote is lost.
Project Manager: Okay.
User Interface: Mm. There's {disfmarker} mm. Mm.
Marketing: {vocalsound}
User Interface: Yeah.
Marketing: Yeah that's right.
User Interface: That {disfmarker} we can {disfmarker} what we can do is we can program a function whereby when you press the switch off T_V_ button, the off button, the remote there be s uh instruction on the screen, please charge charge me. You never get it lost
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
User Interface: because uh every time you're off the computer {vocalsound} {disfmarker} the T_V_ you are asked the the command the T_V_ com remote controller would tell you to put it back to where {disfmarker} to the charger.
Marketing: It's an good reminder,
User Interface: Yeah. So you will never get lost {gap} {disfmarker} yeah.
Marketing: yeah that's right.
Industrial Designer: Okay.
Project Manager: Maybe for some people {gap} {vocalsound} lazy people.
User Interface: Yeah. Yeah because everything is programmed inside.
Project Manager: Yeah yeah.
User Interface: So it's it's uh it's all about strategy, y
Marketing: And of course the final point is a fancy look.
User Interface: Mm.
Marketing: As we have seen earlier the remotes which were displayed by Norman they weren't fancy,
User Interface: Mm.
Industrial Designer: They were ugly.
User Interface: {vocalsound} Yeah, yeah.
Marketing: I mean mm very big or something with lot of buttons.
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} They {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Mm.
Marketing: I think we should have something {disfmarker} it {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Well the last one with the um {vocalsound} yeah with the two parts was uh {gap} original, so {disfmarker}
User Interface: With uh two two two parts controller.
Marketing: I mean {gap} uh I mean uh I mean uh you see if it's like that even a kid who wants to have a control he could just plug it and {vocalsound} use it, you can't avoid him.
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} Yeah.
Marketing: But you can have an button for child lock.
User Interface: Yeah.
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
User Interface: Mm.
Marketing: So just by pressing the button with some code, you t you put a lock onto the remote, so that he can't use even {gap} {disfmarker}
User Interface: Mm. Mm. Mm. Mm.
Industrial Designer: Well we can think about uh having uh on the on the on the user interface when you switch on the T_V_ you can uh well write a code or choose a category, if it is kids, uh things like that.
Marketing: Mm uh {disfmarker}
User Interface: Mm.
Project Manager: Or {disfmarker}
User Interface: Mm. Yeah. Mm.
Marketing: That's right.
Project Manager: Or maybe you have to to show some specific programmes for kids and then just just {disfmarker} yeah just push uh kids button so it's automatically
User Interface: Mm. {gap} these are probl yeah. Mm. Mm. Mm.
Project Manager: {gap}. So if he {gap}.
Marketing: I think these other four points they're the market demands and so it's for the user interface design and industrial design to just think {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: So for mm {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Yeah.
User Interface: Mm.
Industrial Designer: yeah. So for my part I will check the prices the um the prices difference uh of what to use, where to use, and s uh and so on.
Marketing: Yeah I think it should be clearer for us in the next meeting that th uh these {gap} could be included.
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
User Interface: Mm. {vocalsound} I think we need to define also a s the set of vocabularies for the speech recogniser
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
User Interface: because uh if you want {gap} uh say we can sort by channels or sort by T_V_ programs, you have to decide a category of vocabularies for them. If numbers, they're easy,
Project Manager: Mm-hmm.
User Interface: but if {gap} name the channel by by name {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Well I think we can we can have just numbers for channels and you can say to your remote control like uh sports and then on the T_V_ you have a list with with uh uh well with sports program playing now
User Interface: Mm.
Industrial Designer: and and uh {disfmarker}
Marketing: No, we have a problem there. You see uh if you have a voice commands and you are s you are watching a score on uh {disfmarker} basketball score or something, and if the score comes twenty four thirty five, you've just say twenty five
Project Manager: Yeah it's {disfmarker} yeah.
Marketing: and suddenly {vocalsound} the screen the channel goes to twenty five.
User Interface: Mm.
Industrial Designer: That's right, yeah, yeah.
Marketing: So I think there should be a prefix to some numbers {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Well but well e every possible word uh has a probability to come about of the T_V_ so. {vocalsound}
User Interface: Yeah.
Marketing: I mean the the {disfmarker} you just check all the probability that saying T_V_ twenty five and just ordinary twenty five.
User Interface: Mm.
Industrial Designer: Yeah yeah.
Marketing: Ordinary twenty five you almost there's a probability of being said around sixty seventy percent
User Interface: Mm.
Industrial Designer: Yeah but well {disfmarker} okay.
Marketing: and T_V_ twenty five I dunno it will be round about one or two percent.
User Interface: Mm.
Project Manager: Mm-hmm.
User Interface: Mm.
Marketing: So it's better to have some prefix {gap} before the number.
User Interface: But I I I think that the user would like wou would like to associate the channel or call the channel rather than than the numbers.
Marketing: Yeah something, some code.
User Interface: You say numbe channel number five of the T_V_ correspond to something else in the channel.
Industrial Designer: Yeah yeah.
User Interface: So some people may want to say, I want to see this channel.
Industrial Designer: Mm mm. Well I {disfmarker}
Marketing: That will be too big.
Project Manager: Or just {disfmarker}
Marketing: And it will be difficult for the vocabulary also.
User Interface: Yeah. Check with the v R_ and D_ department the capability of recogniser.
Project Manager: It's difficult to to just say the the name of the channel. It will be difficult to say just the name of the channel.
User Interface: {vocalsound} Uh?
Project Manager: Because you have to s t uh a ch
User Interface: Well, it's convenient for the user.
Project Manager: yeah but you have to to have all the name of the channel in your vocabulary.
Marketing: Als might be you just forgot the channel name, you kno only know the number.
Project Manager: Or maybe {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
Marketing: Then {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Or maybe the user can create his own vocabulary,
User Interface: The {disfmarker} uh uh mm. {vocalsound} Mm.
Project Manager: just pronouncing the the name of channels and include in the vocabulary.
User Interface: I I think that I have {disfmarker} mm mm {vocalsound} I think there's another way you can do is that uh you can uh {vocalsound} if {disfmarker} when the user ch press a button to choose the channel for example, then what you can do is that the {disfmarker} you can make the T_V_ screen to split them into small little little squares of images where you you you have a snapshot of every channel, so let's say it's a four by four matrix of the images, so now what you do is f looking at the all the sixteen channels available at one time, you just use the control button uh, you just you you just choose the the option you want
Marketing: Yeah, the {gap}.
User Interface: and then you just hit the button and then you go to that channel. So {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Or lets the user create his own vocabulary of channel.
User Interface: Mm. So you you don't use the speech recogniser in that way.
Project Manager: No. Just you have uh in the beginning you have uh t you have to train {disfmarker} you have to create the vocabulary by yourself.
User Interface: Oh, okay. Yeah.
Industrial Designer: Well I uh I also {disfmarker}
Project Manager: By associating each channel with the name or {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: I I also think about uh another problem, if if there is uh more than one person who is watching T_V_ {vocalsound}
Project Manager: And for each one has his own. {vocalsound}
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: the s well the the speech uh r recogniser should be able to distinguish between the two.
Marketing: Yeah yeah, {gap}.
Industrial Designer: Because uh I remember when I was a {vocalsound} young child with my sister we {disfmarker} yeah we always want to w to watch different emission at the at the same time
User Interface: Mm.
Project Manager: Or you have to s {vocalsound}
User Interface: Yeah, I wanna watch this, I wanna watch that.
Marketing: Yeah.
Industrial Designer: so it's a pr it could be a problem if uh if well if someone passes by when you are watching T_V_ and say oh T_V_ thirty {vocalsound} and just run, s
User Interface: Mm.
Marketing: A and in the same lines we would have a {disfmarker} one more problem. If we are using the television in the different environments, say in the factories or in the shops where there is a lot of noise and this voice commands if they fail to work, that would bring a bad name {disfmarker} bad uh reputation for our company.
Industrial Designer: Yeah, yeah.
Project Manager: Yeah.
User Interface: Mm.
Project Manager: Mm.
Marketing: So I think we should specify some pre-requirements if we want to use a voice commands, say that it should be used in an silent homely environment or s something.
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} Yeah.
Project Manager: Or we can switch on or switch off the the special {gap}, yeah.
Marketing: Yeah that's right that should be an option.
User Interface: Mm.
Industrial Designer: Yeah that's {disfmarker} well I think that's a good uh a good option because it's simple and uh simple to implement also, so.
User Interface: Hmm.
Marketing: I think these are the practical problems. So we need to take care of them in the design.
Project Manager: Maybe we'll discuss them in next meeting.
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: It's time to close this meeting.
User Interface: Well, you you stay a five minutes. {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: Okay.
Marketing: Okay.
Project Manager: {vocalsound} Yeah {gap}. {vocalsound} Okay.
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Marketing: {vocalsound} Oh it came there on three minutes back so we are {vocalsound} {disfmarker} I think we can just press the okay. {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: Okay.
Project Manager: Thanks for your collaborations.
Industrial Designer: So I see ya.
Marketing: Okay. See you another thirty minutes.","The team discussed the conceptual design and some specific details in this meeting. Industrial Designer talked about the components concept of industrial design, such as the different choice of energy and the different material of the remote control. The team would find out which one to use in the future. User Interface designer gave the presentation about system design, mainly about programme design for different users and to help them use the device. Then the team decided to discuss the marketing part at first, then discuss what to design. Marketing talked about specific details found in the market survey. The team agreed to use fancier design, less buttons and focus on voice recognition. They would find out whether using LCD on remote controls was too expensive or not. Team members agreed to use a voice commander and fixed charger, which would prevent the remote control getting lost. Then the team talked about the set of vocabularies for the speech recogniser.",qmsum
"Summarize the whole meeting.
Project Manager: Okay, good morning. This is our first team meeting.
User Interface: Good day.
Marketing: Morning.
Industrial Designer: Morning.
Project Manager: I'll be your Project Manager for today, for this project. My name is Mark {gap} will be giving this presentation for you to kick the project off. {vocalsound} That's my uh that's the agenda for today. Well, of course we're new to each other, so I'd like to get acquainted first. So let's do that first, I mean {disfmarker} Let's start with you, can you introduce yourself? You're our Marketing Expert.
Marketing: Yes. {vocalsound} Um my name is Dirk, Dirk Meinfeld. Um I will be uh {gap} Pr Project {disfmarker} the Marketing Expert. And I will see what the user wants and uh what we can do uh with the new produ project {disfmarker} product. {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Okay, excellent. And you are User Interface {disfmarker}
User Interface: Nick Broer,
Project Manager: Yeah.
User Interface: User Interface Designer. I'm going to uh look at the technical design from the uh user point of view.
Project Manager: Excellent. Okay.
Industrial Designer: My name is Xavier Juergens, I'm the Industrial Designer, and there are three main questions that I have to find an answer to today. First one is uh what happens inside the apparatus, second is what is uh the apparatus made of,
Marketing: Hmm.
Industrial Designer: and the third is what should it look like.
Project Manager: What should it look like? Okay.
Marketing: Hmm.
Project Manager: Oh, let's kick it off. Oh, there we go. So, our new project is about {disfmarker} we need design a remote control for television set, so, which has to be original, trendy and user-friendly. I took this off our corporate website. {disfmarker} I think well it sums up what we need to do. It's We're inspired by latest fashion, not only electronics, but also the latest trends in clothes and interior design. That's why our product will always fit in your home. So apparently we need to {vocalsound} um be very at um very open to what's currently hot in the market. So that's what you need to do to bring us the latest info and what people want.
Marketing: Yeah. Yeah.
Project Manager: So {disfmarker} So we put the fashion in electronics. So that's what we need to go for. Anyway, we'll take this project in three steps, three pha uh three phase of design. First step will be the functional design.
Marketing: Yeah.
Project Manager: And that's basically what we're gonna do. Everybody has uh a piece of individual work and a meeting afterwards, so we can share information about {disfmarker} So I'm gonna keep this short, since we had a technical problem. So skip through this. Uh. Okay. Every meeting we {disfmarker} everybody can present their uh their views and everything, so to help with these, you have {disfmarker} we have the SMARTboards here. We can use a regular PowerPoint presentation. I'm supposed to give you an introduction on this doodling board, so it's {disfmarker} actually it's very easy. Like it says, very simple, you just take out the pen. Like you see here, I'll just take the {disfmarker} take {gap} here. That's it, you just put it on the board. You see a pen here. You go here, just like using a pen. You can just draw whatever you want. It's like the eraser, can erase whatever you want. And so it will be easy just to illustrate your views, if you wanna change the format, you just {vocalsound} either take out jus just like the pen, and whatever you want, your current colour, your line width, just to make the line bigger. So it should be really easy.
Marketing: Okay.
Project Manager: This is to take the {disfmarker} just take a new slide and back again. We're just gonna keep using this board all the time, so I think it will be {disfmarker} it's very clear for everyone, I suppose. So I'll take this out. {vocalsound} Okay. We'll use that later. Anyway. Yeah, just just just stuff that you wanna share, just put it in the in the project folder, like I put my presentation now. I'll put the the minutes of every meeting, I'll put them there too, so everybody can read up if they have to leave early or whatever. So next, been here. {vocalsound} Well, {gap} gonna give the electronic white-board uh a shot. So basic idea is we have a blank sheet. Just try whatever you want, and like it says, draw your favourite animal. I think the creative genius should go first. {vocalsound}
User Interface: {vocalsound} The creative genius?
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Marketing: {vocalsound}
User Interface: Thank you very much.
Project Manager: So, draw us your favourite animal.
User Interface: {vocalsound} Well, I'm more into the technical aspects of drawing,
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
User Interface: so I'm not really good at drawing animals,
Project Manager: Draw us a technical animal.
User Interface: but uh the animal which I {gap} {disfmarker} Oh.
Project Manager: Yeah, it's still erasing.
User Interface: {vocalsound} Pen.
Marketing: {vocalsound}
User Interface: Uh format. Else my animal will be like king-size. I pretty much like {vocalsound} a dolphin, because of its uh its freedom basically. Let's see. A head. {gap} actually worked with this. It's like uh it's a very {disfmarker} Uh high-tech.
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} {vocalsound}
Marketing: {vocalsound}
User Interface: Bit low-responsive though.
Project Manager: {vocalsound} So that's what we don't want.
User Interface: Prefer pen and paper.
Project Manager: We want a high-responsive product. So {disfmarker} It looks more like nuclear bomb.
Marketing: {vocalsound} Very nice dolphin.
User Interface: It {vocalsound} {vocalsound} doesn't look like a nuclear bomb.
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} {vocalsound}
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
User Interface: This thing isn't doing what I'm {disfmarker} What I want.
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Let's go easy on it.
User Interface: So {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Yeah, well it does look like a nuclear bomb.
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
Marketing: {vocalsound}
User Interface: I'll just finish up real soon, because I'm {disfmarker}
Marketing: {vocalsound}
User Interface: So it doesn't really look like a dolphin,
Project Manager: {vocalsound} Anyway,
User Interface: but then again, this is all new for me.
Project Manager: it should {disfmarker} It {disfmarker} It's supposed to be a dolphin, you like the freedom that it {disfmarker} that it represents.
Industrial Designer: Uh-huh.
User Interface: Like the ocean, like swimming. Do that in my spare time, so that's basically an {disfmarker}
Project Manager: What do you like? Okay. Well,
User Interface: Now we can forget this ever happened.
Project Manager: our Marketing Expert. Show us an animal.
Marketing: Um an animal.
Project Manager: {gap} Pick a {disfmarker} pick a {disfmarker}
Marketing: I like the elephant. {vocalsound}
Project Manager: pick a clean sheet. Oh. Take a clean sheet first.
Marketing: What? Yeah. Um {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Just press next. That's it.
Marketing: Oh yeah. Oh, a blank. Okay, next. Free, I like the elephant. It's big, it's strong, so uh uh {disfmarker} Oh, it's a little bit {disfmarker}
User Interface: It's not really that responsive, no. {vocalsound}
Marketing: You have to hold it, right?
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: Mm.
Marketing: Hmm.
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
Marketing: {gap} It's a beautiful animal.
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
Marketing: Oh, you have to p press it pretty hard. With a smile on it,
Project Manager: {vocalsound} It's a cute elephant.
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Marketing: it's very important. Yeah.
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
Marketing: And uh not to forget its tail. Oh.
Project Manager: It's a nice beard.
Marketing: Yeah, it's okay. Yes. {vocalsound}
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
User Interface: And you was making comments on my dolphin. {vocalsound}
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
Marketing: {vocalsound} I will beat the dolphin. {vocalsound} No.
Project Manager: Okay, so it's just a bee.
Marketing: Yeah.
Project Manager: So I suggest you make us the elephant in the market. The big and strong player in the market. This would be good.
Marketing: Yeah. Yeah.
Project Manager: Okay, excellent. On to the next one.
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} Okay.
Marketing: Uh yeah.
Industrial Designer: Okay, you should press next.
Marketing: {vocalsound} Yeah.
Project Manager: Press next. Yeah, it's up there.
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} Okay.
Project Manager: That's it.
Industrial Designer: Okay, well the animal I'd like to draw is a tiger.
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
User Interface: You picked a hard one, didn't you? {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: My drawing skills are really bad, so.
Marketing: Experience with the tiger.
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
Marketing: What? They are {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: They are really bad, my drawing skills.
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
Marketing: Okay uh-huh.
Project Manager: Sure looks smooth.
Marketing: Oh.
Industrial Designer: I'm not sure how the legs should go, but {disfmarker}
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: Uh these are stripes.
User Interface: Got it. {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: I've picked this animal because it's very fast. It is uh it knows exactly what it wants. Uh it hardly ever wastes any resources.
Project Manager: What does it want?
Industrial Designer: Uh well, basically uh it hunts for prey, but it does it always in a very well-thought way. Uh it knows exactly what it wants. It never kills an animal uh just for the killing, so it's very efficient. And it tries to do everything as fast as possible.
Project Manager: Okay.
Industrial Designer: And it always goes for uh security, in seeking uh uh a hide spot and uh and doing everything,
Marketing: Mm.
Industrial Designer: security, speed and efficiency is important. And I think uh those things we can use.
Project Manager: I agree.
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Marketing: Okay.
Project Manager: , I'm supposed to draw the animal next. Yay I introduce to the world the amazing ant.
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Marketing: {vocalsound} Uh hard worker.
Project Manager: Great team-workers.
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
Marketing: Yeah.
Project Manager: Do everything to Uh really small, but together they're really strong. So I'm gonna give it a smiley face.
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} Oh.
Marketing: Yeah, yeah.
Project Manager: Not sure where the p {gap}. Just put'em here. Whatever. {vocalsound}
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Think it need shoes. So {disfmarker}
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: {vocalsound} I'm just too lazy to draw it all black, so {disfmarker} {vocalsound} That's the coolest ant ever.
User Interface: You've done this before, haven't you? {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: I love to draw ants. It's my hobby.
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Anyway {disfmarker} Nah. {vocalsound} Just {disfmarker} I think it's very representative what we drew, I guess. Like you take {disfmarker} just take your freedom and use a a trendy interface that you design for us.
Marketing: Yeah.
Project Manager: Just {disfmarker} Yeah. You're supposed to make i make it different from uh from what other people have, and just make it a little distinct. Anyway. {gap} another beep to stop the meeting. See. Warning. Finish meeting now. Uh put this down. Examples. Well I guess we have a little little time extra, but {disfmarker} Just a little quick discussion to to open open our work. So what do you guys think about {disfmarker} The first idea is just very short. I'll start with you. What are y What are your first ideas for the new product? What {disfmarker}
User Interface: Well, I basically had a question. Do {vocalsound} uh {disfmarker} Are we going to introduce a multi remote control? Is it just the T_V_ or do we want to in
Project Manager: The project I got was just for a T_V_ remote control.
Marketing: Uh {vocalsound} {disfmarker}
User Interface: Just for T_V_ remote control.
Project Manager: Yeah, I guess so.
Marketing: Yeah.
User Interface: Okay. Well, I was thinking about design remote control, with our uh motto and all.
Marketing: But {disfmarker}
User Interface: Uh thing to keep in mind is that we need to stick to what people are familiar with.
Marketing: Yeah.
User Interface: No rational changes or whatever,'cause it {disfmarker} revolutionary changes,
Project Manager: Okay, so very intuitive design, I guess.
User Interface: yes. {vocalsound} Uh we might have to consider other design aspects of our product. So that was something I wanted to add,
Project Manager: {gap}
User Interface: and perhaps some usability aspect. T_V_ is becoming central in most homes. Do we want people who are disabled in any way to uh, yeah, to be able to use it as well?
Project Manager: Yeah, we want {disfmarker} I suppose we want almost everyone to be using it. So {vocalsound} I think {disfmarker} I mean, really disabled people, yeah, {vocalsound} might be a problem, but I think it's a little {gap} take it into consideration. Um yeah. I think we really need to cut the meeting short. You have anything you wanna share quickly?
Industrial Designer: Hmm.
Marketing: Uh.
Industrial Designer: Only one thing uh that has to be added according to me is uh the the material it is made of, it should be something light.
User Interface: Yeah.
Industrial Designer: That's {disfmarker} it speaks for itself,
Project Manager: It should be light, okay.
Industrial Designer: but some uh {disfmarker} Yeah.
Project Manager: Um, let's see,
Marketing: Yeah.
Project Manager: where did I {disfmarker} Let's skip that. Oh, this is it. Sorry, I skipped this sheet.
Marketing: Selling price.
Project Manager: What do we {disfmarker} This {disfmarker} Quick {gap} {disfmarker} What we're going to {disfmarker} Selling price, twenty five Euros. That's for you. The production price, twelve and a half Euros, approximately.
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} Okay.
Project Manager: Just go go for that. We'll reach the uh reach that profit.
Industrial Designer: Okay.
User Interface: Okay, well that's not that much to work with. {vocalsound}
Marketing: {gap} international.
Project Manager: No, it's not much to work on. I'm sorry, I skipped it. {vocalsound} Anyways, that's {disfmarker} Yeah, this is it. Do you have anything you you came up with yet? About uh marketing transfer, whatever?
Marketing: Um about what? Marketing?
Project Manager: Marketing {gap} I'm not sure what you what you came up with yet. You have anything to share? Or else we'll cut the meeting just cut the meeting short
Marketing: {vocalsound} Um no, not really yet,
Project Manager: since we're supposed to stop.
Marketing: but I've some ideas
Project Manager: Okay.
Marketing: and I will uh say it uh {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Anyways, the the personal coach will give you the your p your personal assignments and everything. So we'll just meet back in here thirty minutes.
Industrial Designer: Okay.
Marketing: Okay.
Project Manager: I'm sure we have that.
Industrial Designer: Good luck everyone.
Project Manager: Yeah, thanks for attending.
User Interface: Mm, good luck.
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: I'll see you back here in thirty minutes.
Marketing: Okay. Yes.
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}","Project Manager asked the team members give personal introductions respectively to get acquainted with each other, and then introduced a new remote control project. Before discussing the product-related issues, the manager asked the members to get acquainted with the SMARTboards for further presentation and information sharing work by drawing in turns. After the drawing session, the manager reemphasized the program target and required the remote control to possess with a user-familiarized feature. Other group members voiced out additional design aspects, including usability and lightness. Finally, the team agreed on both the selling and the production price.",qmsum
"What did Marketing think of the incorporation of voice recognition when discussing user requirements of the new remote control?
Marketing: Just put it on the deskt {gap} desktop.
Project Manager: No on the desktop you'll find you should find that there's a project documents link. A well actually just there.
Marketing: Project documents,
Project Manager: Yeah. That's it.
Marketing: yeah.
Project Manager: If you dump it in there.
Marketing: What's your username?
Project Manager: Your username.
Marketing: What's your username and password? Mm-hmm. Sorry.
Project Manager: Okay.
Marketing: Okay. There we go.
Project Manager: Excellent. Right. Hopefully that's us ready to uh to go. So. Functional design meeting. We'll have to flesh out some of the uh stuff. Um we'll start with the minutes of the last meeting. Not a lot thankfully to say. We introduced ourselves, discussed the possibility of a macro facility, interac interacting the T_V_ a bit more, um mentioning of bar-code, joystick for user manipulation, um and ergonomics of the remote control as well. Um it's come to my attention the following. Teletext has become outdated due to the populat popularity of the internet. Remote control should only be used for the T_V_. Um due for uh time to market and possibly also cost issues. Um also key is the corporate image should stay recognisable, um f uh your colour and slogan of course is down at the bottom there. Um. Now. Just to say quickly uh I would have thought that only being used for a television the macro facility may now not be required.
User Interface: Mm.
Project Manager: Um or at l its functionality would have been of limited use. So to the point in my opinion anyway that it might not be worth pursuing. Um if anybody disagrees we can uh definitely say so. Um and hopefully we'll just crack on and we'll get everything going. Um I'd like to if possible hear from our Marketing Expert first, to help us gain an idea of where we're going to go.
Marketing:'Kay.
Project Manager: So um I'll just load up your presentation from here if you want.
Marketing: Sure. Um, sh would you like to {vocalsound} I'll just do it from here.
Project Manager: Yep. Sorry. Uh. Is yours the {disfmarker}
Marketing: Um, try second one maybe. Try it, yeah maybe.
Project Manager: Oh sorry. Okay, right.
Marketing: Yeah. Okay. Oh, I thought I put in my last name, I guess not, but {gap}.
Project Manager: Uh if you {disfmarker} that's all right. If you {disfmarker} do you want me to just cycle through it for you or?
Marketing: Okay. {vocalsound} Oh yeah, that'd be fine, that'd be great.
Project Manager: Yeah?
Marketing: Okay. Functional requirement by me Ebenezer. {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Okay.
Marketing: Okay, so um we did some research, we asked one hundred people their opinions on remote controls. We asked some uh open ended questions, just, what are your opinions on the remote control, got a lot of re responses, and we asked some very specific questions, and we got a lot of good feedback. Please bear in mind this is only a hundred people, so even when the groups are divided into fifteen to twenty five, twenty five to thirty five, there's only maybe ten people {vocalsound} fifteen people in each group.
Project Manager: Okay.
Marketing: Okay. {vocalsound} So we got {disfmarker} some the bad stuff we got, remotes are often lost. I often lose my remote control, the back of the couch, some place, and even if it's not lost permanently, it takes me a few minutes to find it. {vocalsound} Most buttons are not used any more, like you said, teletext is outdated now. I remember trying to load a D_V_D_ player recently, and there were so many buttons, it took me I don't know maybe ten minutes to to go through each button,'cause you have to press the shift button to access the yellow buttons, you know there's just a lot of stuff that no one really uses. And if they do, not very often. Takes too long to master the remote control. I've seen some remote controls that are big, they have a lot of buttons, you have to hold down more than one key at one time to do something, they're just not great to use. We just got a lot of bad complaints about remote controls, people do not like remote controls. Some of the good stuff we got. Between the age of uh fifteen and twenty five, most people would be willing to pay extra for voice recognition software. Now don't get excited yet, I've got more to say on that. Most people'd be willing to pay for that um most people want remote controls to be pretty, they want it to be fancy, th they they want it to be different, everybody has a white remote control with black buttons, and a red button and a green button, not everybody wants that. {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Finally, my opinion.
Project Manager: Yep.
Marketing: The voice recognition thing is cool. And uh voice recognition, the software, open source software exist already. It's a bit sketchy at some times, uh, you're not gonna get good always accurate results, but for a very fixed number of words, you know you have, how many different words can you have for a remote control, up, down, left, right, channel five, channel seven, you know, how many, you can't have that many words. For a fixed vocabulary it works quite well. I'm pretty sure people would buy it. But after a while people may wanna return it, because {vocalsound} if you have to to say som I mean most people use a remote control for switching to channels, and they say they do that about ninety eight percent of the time. Using the remote control, ninety eight percent of the time for changing channels, and that's for flickering through channels. So if you have to say up, up, up, up, if you have to do that all the time, then people might get a bit fed up with that and they may return it. {vocalsound} However, {vocalsound} oh, because the voice recognition software exists already, there's no need to spend money on research and development, but this does mean the need for microphones in the in the remote control, which is an unusual feature in my opinion. But if we do have the voice recognition thing, there's a lot of stuff that you can uh get rid of. See, you could {disfmarker} there're two options. Either you have voice recognition by itself, which I think is a bit impractical for like night time if you wanna be watching television and you wanna be quiet, or I don't know you have a visitor coming round and the remote's only trained for you, it's a bit impractical to have just voice recognition by itself. So you can have voice recognition and a regular remote. But imagine you got rid of the regular remote part, then you can design the remote to look any way you want it to look, because there are no restrictions on physical size, or shape, it it could be as fancy as you want it to be, you know, it could be like a lollipop or something like that, something weird like that. As long as the voice recognition stuff works, that's that's fine.
Project Manager: Okay, yep.
Marketing: So we have the three birds, we have the design, that {vocalsound} we have the the fancy bit, right, the voice recognition's fancy, it's cool, it's different, it's radical, so, and then we have an extra bit I don't remember {vocalsound} so I'm pretty sure people will buy the remote, but is it practical to have a voice recognition system in a remote control, I think is a big question. Um, will people will people be willing to wait for the the period that it'll take to train the remote,'cause I think it will the remote will uh get better over time with the same user user, but for the first week or for the first two weeks are you willing to wait, are you willing to have a bad remote control. {vocalsound} And uh what if you have visitors come round, they stay the night, they wanna use the T_V_, they can't use the remote because they speak differently to you. Um, how do you account for regional accents and stuff like that. Uh, will people return the remote control, {vocalsound} I think a lot of young people will buy the remote control, if they have the money, you know, so,
Project Manager: Mm-hmm. If you could uh
Marketing: do our audience have the money, but would they return it after a while because it's not as fast as pressing a button, it's not a practical. So. These are things I think we should consider.
Project Manager: sor
Marketing: I think it's cool,
Project Manager: if you could speed it up a bit, yeah. If you could uh speed it up a bit please, yeah.
Marketing: I'm sorry? Sure.
Project Manager: Sorry.
Marketing: I'm about to end, yeah.
Project Manager: Cool.
Marketing: I think it's cool but there are definitely some considerations.
Project Manager: Okay. Excellent.
Marketing: So, yeah.
Project Manager: Right. Um. Hear from the {vocalsound} User Interface Designer now I think might be an idea.
User Interface: Okay.
Project Manager: Um, you've got your presentation now,
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} How did {disfmarker} where did {disfmarker}
User Interface: Yeah, it's in the it's in the folder
Project Manager: is it on the {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: where did you get all your in information {gap}?
User Interface: yeah.
Project Manager: is it? Okay.
Marketing: There was uh a website, uh,
Industrial Designer: Oh.
Project Manager: {vocalsound} Technical functions?
Marketing: right here.
Industrial Designer: Ah, okay.
User Interface: Mm.
Project Manager: No. Yeah. Okay.
User Interface: Okay, this is a {vocalsound} brief run through of the um of the technical functions of the remote. As um is uh the the the presentation is uh already slightly obsolete because I {vocalsound} had in mind something that would uh be i be aimed at controlling multiple devices but uh there's still stuff of relevance, so
Project Manager: Okay.
User Interface: press on. I've looked at {vocalsound} looked at a num {vocalsound} uh couple of other uh remote control models just for an idea of basic design principles. Um and wasn't really satisfied by what I saw I have to say so this is more sort of springboard for uh how these could be improved on. {vocalsound} Um um basically the job of the device is to send commands to an appliance, in this case the television set. Um to save you getting off your backside. Um and there's two main trends in th in the sort of design practice. On the one hand {disfmarker} and this uh this particularly relates to its sort of earliest models where with you know i so so many buttons on it so about the size of the television set. Um giving you every possible function that the that the device has, the remote control controls. And most of these functions are not going to be used, it creates a rather user unfriendly interface. And on the other hand there's a user focused approach that pares things down to just what {vocalsound} what is most likely to get used. Um {vocalsound} With uh {disfmarker} a and a and of course there is a certain amount of sort of loss of function here obviously, but mostly that's relatively peripheral functions. And so you go for something that's fairly intuitive to use, and um well f the for the most part for T_V_ remote it's uh tha that would be channel control and volume. Um and if you {vocalsound} if you if you are wanting to incorporate uh control of a D_V_ {vocalsound} D_V_D_ or uh {vocalsound} V_C_R_ presumably into that then there's a play, pause, stop, rewind, fast-forward, record, so forth. Um. My own view is that we should definitely be going for a user focused design. Um but uh the pro {vocalsound} I think the problem with a lot of the sort of user focused designs that are about is that they sort of make assumptions in advance about what uh what a given user's going to uh want mo want to do from {vocalsound} want it to do most. So, something that's uh {vocalsound} something that is more programmable, that uh perh perhaps has the full range of functions available to it but you can then specify yourself what you're most likely to want. Um so that those are then immediately {vocalsound} accessible through fairly minimal number of controls, um I liked Ebenezer's idea of including a joystick in that and uh possibly a sort of fairly minimal number of sort of function buttons, and have a disp {vocalsound} you then have some sort of basic display on it so that if you're um sort of cha changing from different modes for the device it'll tell you just exactly what uh you know each direction of the uh of the um joystick's {vocalsound} going to do or wha or what each function button's going to do. Um, this is actually {gap} a again slightly taking inspiration off of uh games controllers, you know the Playstation control where you have four basic function buttons
Marketing: Mm.
User Interface: that are just marked with um distinctive uh geometrical shapes but the {vocalsound} and then dependent on what you're doing with it what game and so on um those uh those functions are then sort of further specified. And so it's taking taking the lead from that. Um.
Project Manager: Okay. Yeah.
User Interface: {vocalsound} That's it.
Project Manager: Right. Um, if we could hear from our Industrial engineer, or Designer.
Industrial Designer: Yeah. Uh, I was still working on stuff, I hadn't got it finished. Um, {vocalsound} alright. Click to save in {disfmarker} where do I have to save it?
Project Manager: If you look on the desktop you'll find that there's a link to the project folder, or project documents. If you save it in there we can open it up from here.
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} Um, what I've done with it, I'm sorry. Shit. Um {vocalsound} {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Are you finding it okay or?
Industrial Designer: I'm just {gap} closing it now. {gap} where I've saved it.
Marketing: Well like if you go to one, uh whichever one you were working {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: {gap} that's it there,
Marketing: yeah,
Industrial Designer: yeah.
Marketing: and you just click file save as.
Industrial Designer: Oh right. {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Okay.
Industrial Designer: Uh, right I'm responsible for working design, uh, this is basically the inside going on of the the uh remote control. So we have the energy source, we have the user interface, this this is what I've seen. Uh the sender will push the button, the chip will respond, uh and then the dig digital signal is sent to the T_V_. So uh uh, if you go to next slide, you'll see you'll see uh what do we need on the user interface. Do we need uh many buttons, or do we need l many light bulbs that could be easier to uh to realise which appliances are on or not. Um, {vocalsound}, or would that take too much power, would we need more um components in there to supply the power? Um, the joystick is another thing, if we were gonna add that, um, there'd be more components to deal with that.
Project Manager: Mm-hmm.
Industrial Designer: Um {vocalsound}, so uh we need to {disfmarker} I dunno exactly what {disfmarker} That's the design of the the the layout of the uh electronic design, um obviously there'll be more details once we've decided what we're putting on the user interface.
Project Manager: Okay.
Industrial Designer: So, that'll be decided, I guess. {vocalsound} Uh, and the next slide. Oh, yeah {disfmarker} Um, if you go to the next slide then.
Project Manager: Oh. Yeah.
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: I just used the {vocalsound} it was a mess, uh I was just putting adding it together at the end there. Uh {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Ah, don't worry about it at all mate. {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: Uh so you have the energy source obviously connected to the chip, and the user interface obviously contains everything. You have the switch turn it on, infrared bulb, uh will contact the T_V_ and will have whatever device or D_V_D_ player, the bulb will turn on to say it's on. Uh, so do we need on the control uh different buttons to decide, or different light bulbs, would it be easier? Um, I dunno what we should decide on that.
Project Manager: Okay. Well. Oh sorry, I'm I'm interrupting you. Are you {disfmarker} is it {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: No, it's finished, yeah.
Project Manager: yeah? Okay. Right. Um, {vocalsound} right we can probably skip that for now. So, we've had some stuff put forward, um along with the new user requirements, um we've had a lot of kind of input I'd say so far. Um I hear what the Marketing Expert's saying about {vocalsound} um voice activated control. However I've got a couple of worries about that. {vocalsound} The power required, um and the ability to the cost, it seems like for uh an embedded system, this could cause us issues.
Industrial Designer: Cost. Mm.
Project Manager: Um for example you see that there's fairly robust services on uh computers via uh via voice, I_B_M_ do um drag and dictate, but these require a lot of memory
Marketing: Mm-hmm.
Project Manager: and usually um state quite advanced processor requirements. Um voice activation could be an interesting idea but I think that our Ind Industrial Designer would probably upon some research say that it's maybe not feasible.
Marketing:'Kay.
Project Manager: Um that's just my view right now,
User Interface: Mm. {vocalsound}
Project Manager: however the idea of a joystick and then maybe an L_C_D_ which has been kind of put forward so far, it's almost like having a small T_ not T_V_ to say, but if you can control almost all of the functionality from the display, I don't know how much power an L_C_D_ would take, but it might be quite low?
Marketing: Mm. I uh {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: L_C_D_ on the remote just telling you what's on, or {vocalsound} uh, interactive L_C_D_ or {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Well literally um if you can imagine the display maybe slightly larger than um those on a {vocalsound} a mobile phone,
User Interface: Mm.
Project Manager: something where you can read an an um fair amount of information, traverse maybe quite a few menus, if we maybe used mobile phones as a good example, they usually incorporate they have the keypad, and then evr all the other functionality is usually associated inside by traversing around.
Marketing: Mm-hmm.
Project Manager: That could be one possibility. Um and then we could have like say the common buttons as you say, volume control, changing channels {disfmarker}
User Interface: Mm. {gap} I I was thinking that the remote {vocalsound} the um {vocalsound} sort of default functions for the joystick would be up and down for uh volume, left and right for channels.
Project Manager: We {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Do you think that people will get mixed up, like, they'll be looking at this screen and that screen and then, you know, trying to get everything working, would it be a bit confusing?
User Interface: Um I think probably for the first couple of hours of using it
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
User Interface: um but you know muscle memory's a wonderful thing, um. And I think {vocalsound} and I think that size of uh display was about what I had in mind.
Marketing: Mm.
User Interface: Um though I mean I w I would say that uh we could probably probably be required to um mo most of the mobile phone displays you see these days are colour but we should probably try to stick to black and white.
Project Manager: {vocalsound} I would agree with you.
User Interface: Si si simply to keep m keep the unit cost down. Um I mean colour could be a sort of subsequent development but uh you know cost a bit of extra money f w w w w w once everyone's got the first, you know, oh colour's out, we'll have to replace it won't we.
Project Manager: Mm-hmm. {vocalsound}
User Interface: It does nothing extra.
Project Manager: That would be my feeling as well, I think we could possibly create quite a useful user interface. Um now I mean I don't {disfmarker}
Marketing: Sure but the idea of a remote with a menu or {disfmarker} and a joystick I think like I h if I was in the habit of buying remote controls then I would want one,
Project Manager: sorry, go for it.
Marketing: but I think we don't have a specific audience, you know, like what is our target audience, what niche are {disfmarker} niche are we trying to market and corner. You know, you know what I'm saying, like, for whom is this intended? Everybody?
Project Manager: {vocalsound} I think it could probably be aimed at most people who've used a mobile. And that might be just another way of saying try to target most people.
Marketing: Most people, yeah.
User Interface: Mm.
Project Manager: Um, if we are if we were to follow that avenue, we might be s you know um we're kind of almost relying on their experience with a mobile phone I suppose. But that does cover a very large section of the people out there.
Marketing: Mm-hmm. Sure. I think that's fair {vocalsound} yeah.
User Interface: Mm.
Project Manager: Um, I mean I imagine as well that the actual L_C_D_ and maybe to a certain extent the joystick as well would be for the additional functionality. Which maybe doesn't get used as often, maybe it makes it easy for them to figure out how to um change the channels as in the frequencies and such for reprogramming it.
Marketing: Mm-hmm.
Project Manager: Um and you can still have the main buttons that allow the people to turn the machine on and off, d up and down, it depends, I mean maybe we have the fol um the joystick as a separate one for the other functions then, that there's just a a small number of as you were saying uh buttons that have already been defined.
Marketing: Mm-hmm.
Project Manager: So like we go for the nice standard um up and down for and volume control. So that literally anybody can come along, pick up the remote and still know what do do. And they can completely ignore most of the functionality which would be for say the o actual owner of the the T_V_
Marketing: Mm-hmm.
Project Manager: and who would normally use the unit.
User Interface: Mm. {vocalsound} I th the thing I like about the uh the uh joystick
Project Manager: I dunno.
Marketing: Mm-hmm.
User Interface: is that uh you you you then basically you can then basically put it I mean for for T_ T_ for T_V_ remote alone, you could put um I mean there are {disfmarker} like I say the the the main things people do with a T_V_ remote control is the volume and the channel. You can pack all that onto was onto a single control. Um.
Project Manager: Mm-hmm.
User Interface: But uh but the {vocalsound} but then o uh obviously if uh you know if you i if you wanted to access further functions i {vocalsound} you you then get to sort of menu navigation. I mean with things like ch with things like tuning and channels um you know adjusting brightn uh brightness and {vocalsound} fiddly things that no one really bothers with, most T_V_s these days actually have menus anyway so this would be a fairly rational way of integra {gap}
Project Manager: Mm-hmm.
User Interface: integrating the uh the remote with the device it's controlling. Um {gap} concern about our market. Um, if we are I mean most of the uh of the replacement remote market is sort of {gap} remote control rationalisation. Um, you've got twenty different devices in your living room,
Marketing: Yeah. Mm-hmm.
User Interface: you want one wo {vocalsound} y you want one that'll do the job of all of them. Um, if all you're replacing is one of the you know however many remotes you have in your living room, um you know you still need separate remotes for everything else.
Project Manager: Mm-hmm.
User Interface: I just think that uh possibly {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Well this is a requirement that we have to stick to I'm afraid,
User Interface: mm.
Project Manager: this isn't one that I've just arbitrarily decided on.
User Interface: Mm.
Project Manager: So um this is this is one of the solid ones that has to be obeyed, for now.
User Interface: Mm.
Project Manager: So I can understand your point, and I would agree with you, but this is our design spec for now.'Fraid to say. Um {disfmarker}
User Interface: {vocalsound} Does that um would that include um access to say {vocalsound} interactive functions on digital or cable?
Marketing: {vocalsound} Yeah.
Project Manager: I would say so, yes, because then we have to be able to control the remote boxes, and that is a separate unit. Um I think that it {disfmarker} I would say that the design spec we've been {gap} with is for the television only for now.
User Interface: Mm-hmm.
Project Manager: And until we hear otherwise we should go with just that.
Marketing: Hmm. Okay, specifically television.
User Interface: Okay.
Project Manager: Okay. Maybe we'll hear differently, but for now {disfmarker}
Marketing: So the joystick is just for differentness.
User Interface: Mm.
Project Manager: It would be ease of manipulation of certain functions, yes. Um {disfmarker}
Marketing: Okay.
User Interface: Just a thought. {vocalsound} Um maybe then our market should be T_V_ manufacturers, rather than the public. Try and sell it t sell it to them to supply with um {disfmarker}
Project Manager: There is that possibility, yes. B However I don't know exactly where we'll be going with that, but it might not even be the avenue of the Marketing Expert,
Marketing: Mm. {vocalsound}
Project Manager: that might be sales, who are not in this meeting.
Marketing: Mm-hmm. It's just, the way I figure it, twelve point five Euros per unit, we have to sell at least like three million or something like that,
Project Manager: Mm-hmm.
Marketing: not to account for all the the money we waste on remotes that no one buys, you know, like if we made a perf if we made a ks for every remote we made someone bought it, then we have to sell a lot of remote controls.
Project Manager: Mm-hmm.
Marketing: We just {disfmarker} Is this gonna be enough to to sell?
Project Manager: Well, something else that you brought up was uh the ability to lose a remote, which as you said you've done, in fact we've probably all done.
Marketing: Yeah.
Project Manager: Um, I don't know if it's a gimmick or not, but have any of you ever seen those odd little key rings where if you whistle, it will beep and you {disfmarker} tell you where it is.
User Interface: Mm, yeah, I've seen them.
Marketing: I had one of those, and my brother, and my dad, could have beat me up
Project Manager: Um. Well
Marketing: because it it went off all the time accidentally.
Project Manager: the other option of course is that um the
Marketing: The clapping one. {vocalsound}
Project Manager: well {disfmarker} I was going to say clapping, um {disfmarker} Um digital telephones, uh for example, one unit has {disfmarker} of course you have to have that base unit, somewhere where there's a button, but maybe it's a button that you attach to the T_V_.
User Interface: Mm.
Marketing: To a television. {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Something which you when you press that, it would beep to give its location away, on the remote unit.
Marketing: Yeah.
User Interface: Yeah, I think that's a good idea.
Project Manager: And that could be something could um separate us a bit.
Marketing: Yeah, that's a good idea.
Project Manager: And that way, because we're attaching what would be a small button to the T_V_, again say what, it would be a small transmitter, um watch battery type scenario I would say, or something that if it was problems enough you could actually even just um I don't {disfmarker} power {gap} that might be something that we could look into.
Industrial Designer: Yeah {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Yep. Yeah, it's uh putting a lot on your shoulders there, so I mean that could be something that separates us a bit from the market as well.
Marketing: {vocalsound} I think so, yeah.
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: So. To go on from here. Um we have to decide exactly what we're going to do with the remote. Before we leave this meeting, it would be best to say this is what we're going {disfmarker} this is the design we're gonna try and get, this is how we're gonna make ourselves look unique.
User Interface: Mm.
Project Manager: Do we go for maybe a remote contro uh sorry, we're gonna go for a remote control obviously, do we go for a small joystick that would operate say changing channels, up and down, and then, what, another button that would say that it's now being used to manoeuvre round the L_C_D_.
User Interface: Mm yeah. Yeah, I think that's {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: We're just saying volume. Should volume be important in the joystick, do you think?
User Interface: Yeah.
Project Manager: We could use say the left and right for changing channels and the up and down for volume,
User Interface: For volume.
Project Manager: and {disfmarker}
Marketing: But we have a frequency of how what people use a remote control for most.
Industrial Designer: Yep.
Project Manager: Okay.
Marketing: Um, power is used like once per hour,
Industrial Designer: I
Marketing: channel selection is used a hundred and sixty eight per hour,
Project Manager: Mm-hmm.
Marketing: that's by far the biggest one, and then teletext, is still here, that's like fourteen,
Project Manager: Vol Volume selection okay, yep,
Marketing: and volume selection.
Project Manager: the teletext we're gambling with, and we're gonna say it's dead, the way of the dodo {disfmarker}
Marketing: No, yeah, okay okay. Yeah, um {vocalsound} {disfmarker}
Project Manager: So we {disfmarker} well, sorry, we could maybe even go as far as saying power button, small joystick, L_C_D_, and then what maybe is it one more button to say that you're using the menu system, and with the possibility of pushing down on the joystick to say okay? So we're having very very few buttons involved,
User Interface: Actually how {disfmarker}
Project Manager: but navigation around a menu for most things.
User Interface: Actually I would say maybe two two function buttons, the {disfmarker} y we're now using the menus button and um and an og and an okay button. I mean certainly something I've found with the joystick on mo the joysticks on mobile phones is that a lot of the time th the device mistakes you trying to move it in one direction or the other for pushing down for okay.
Project Manager: Okay.
User Interface: Or vice versa.
Project Manager: Okay.
User Interface: And that's really irritating.
Marketing: Mm-hmm.
User Interface: {vocalsound} The o the o the other dis design constraint I think we should bear in mind is that people are you know very much used to using a remote control one handedly, um, so we need to make sure that e even with the joystick, you know something that can just sit comfortably in the palm of the hand and have the joystick just controlled by the thumb.
Project Manager: Okay. So um we're actually that sounds like a rough idea. Do we incorporate the idea of trying to f locate the remote control again via a beeping noise?
Industrial Designer: Yeah, think so.
Project Manager: {vocalsound} Do you mind looking {gap}?
Marketing: Um, I think because it's so small it might be an uh I mean if we only have like two three buttons it might be essential to have to have that {disfmarker}
Project Manager: The ability to locate it again.
Marketing: Yeah.
Project Manager: So that would require a um transmitter maybe attached to the T_V_, just so that it says find me, and {vocalsound} what, a basically a small microphone um on the actual unit, can maybe hide it in the base.
Industrial Designer: Light bulb as well,
User Interface: Oh. So {vocalsound} so
Industrial Designer: no?
Project Manager: Sorry?
User Interface: a small speaker you mean.
Project Manager: Some speaker,
Marketing: Speaker {vocalsound}
Project Manager: sorry, yeah.
Marketing: yeah.
Industrial Designer: And a light bulb? No. To flash. No.
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Um {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Nah, you'd see it anyway, if you hear it.
Project Manager: {vocalsound} E us we might be better with the sound possibly {disfmarker} we could maybe incorporate
Marketing: W those little key-rings have both,
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
Project Manager: th e the true fact, considering the cost of an L_E_D_, we could just incorporate it anyway.
Marketing: so {disfmarker} Yeah.
Project Manager: The L_E_D_s can be surprisingly bright now.
Marketing: Yeah. Yeah.
Industrial Designer: Mm-hmm.
User Interface: Mm-hmm. Blue ones particularly.
Project Manager: Um. {vocalsound} So
User Interface: Plus that's a nice wee design touch.
Marketing: Yeah.
Project Manager: by the sounds of it, with what we're suggesting so far, your design um the user interface is still quite open, you could go for quite an interesting design.
User Interface: Mm-hmm.
Project Manager: Because we're only going to have a very few key and you've got you know a small L_C_D_, joystick, e I think it leaves you open to a a potential wide range of shapes, something that can make it stand out slightly.
User Interface: Mm-hmm.
Project Manager: Um if you could look into what we've suggested so far, the feasibility of um small transmitter, um and such, maybe if an L_C_D_ screen requires too much power, or such. Ebenezer, um, Marketing Expert {disfmarker}
Marketing: {vocalsound} Well I can give you the frequency, what people what options people use most often, I guess that's gonna be important in the ts defining the the software side of the interface, right.
Project Manager: If,
Marketing: You want the stuff {gap}.
Project Manager: yeah if you could maybe as well see what people think about the idea of this minimalist approach that we've taken, where of a joystick to control the very basic functions, and then the idea of manipulating it like you would a mobile.
Marketing: Okay.
Project Manager: I don't know how easy that will be within the time frame,
Marketing: Okay.
Project Manager: but could be something we could maybe look into.
Marketing: Mm-hmm. Sure. Sure.
Project Manager: Okay. Um any last comments that anybody would like to put forward? Anything that they think has been missed out. Bit of a wide open question there of course.
Marketing: Mm.
Project Manager: Feel free to email me if you think that uh we've screwed something up and wanna get it rectified as soon as possible.
Marketing: Sure.'Kay. Yeah.
Project Manager: Right.
Industrial Designer: So I should just look at um the speaker, {gap} the speaker and an L_E_D_.
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Speaker and L_E_D_ for locating, um,
Industrial Designer: And {disfmarker}
Marketing: Transmitter {gap}.
Industrial Designer: Yeah, and a transmitter.
Project Manager: transmitter {disfmarker}
User Interface: Actually one one wee thought about that. Um, if we do end up trying to market this to television manufacturers then the um then the transmitter could actually be built into the television.
Project Manager: {gap} getting the external power source, yep, that's quite true. Um, and something that we can can easily be adopted at the last minute as well I'd say.
User Interface: Yeah.
Project Manager: The electronics could be s either placed externally or internally, makes no difference to the final product of the actual remote control,
User Interface: Mm-hmm.
Project Manager: so that's good.
User Interface: Mm-hmm. {vocalsound} You know I think
Project Manager:'Kay.
User Interface: I mean if it w if we get a major television manufacturer to say y oh yeah we'll have that, save us the bother, then that's you know vast amounts of sales. Quite quickly.
Industrial Designer: P
Project Manager: Oh, one thing that we've almost not talked about at all, my apologies for that, um, user interface, we also need to maybe get the slogan in here, um it's,
Industrial Designer: Fashion.
Project Manager: I'm pointing at my laptop, what in God {disfmarker} Real reaction, and such. So um {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: The slogan is {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Oh, sorry.
Industrial Designer: yeah, the slogan's we put the fashion in electronics, isn't it?
Project Manager: My apologies. No it could well be, I've probably missed that. Um, I think that's l almost the last minute thing
Industrial Designer:'S also look cool.
Project Manager: we can just incorporate into the actual plastic on top.
User Interface: Mm.
Project Manager: So I'm not too concerned a that we haven't gone into depth about that. But it might be something you could consider when you're thinking about shapes?
User Interface: Mm-hmm.
Project Manager: In fact we might like to put a slogan on, and um possibly the two R_s to signify the company. Rather than real reaction.
User Interface: Mm-hmm. Mm. Yeah. I thought the uh the d the double arc could perhaps uh be the uh the enter button.
Project Manager: Sounds good.
User Interface: {gap}.
Project Manager: And I'd say that that's us for now. Okay.","The market research indicated that between the age of 15 and 25, most people would be willing to pay extra fees for voice recognition. However, Marketing pointed out that such a result barely implied users'expectation for a fancy and unique remote control. There were several problems with the existing voice recognition software, such as the limitation on word number and inaccurate recognition results due to regional accents. In conclusion, Marketing considered the incorporation of voice recognition to be unfeasible.",qmsum
"Summarize the whole meeting.
Project Manager: {vocalsound} Good to see you all again. Let's see if that comes up. This is our functional design meeting. Um. Just a sec while my PowerPoint comes up. Et voila. Okay. Mm um we put the fashion in electronics. Let's start. Okay, our agenda today um {disfmarker} just check the time, it's twelve thirteen. Um. I'm gonna do an opening, talk about um {disfmarker} did you all get the minutes? I e-mailed them to you. I'm also putting'em {disfmarker} them in the shared folder.
User Interface: Yep.
Project Manager: So um then I {disfmarker} we'll talk about our general objectives
Industrial Designer: Right.
Project Manager: and have your three presentations. Um I'll talk about the new project requirements I've just received, and then we have to make a decision on our remote control functions. Finally we'll just close. We're starting this meeting at approximately twelve thirteen and we have forty minutes. So {disfmarker} First of all the functional design objectives. Uh we need to keep in mind the user requirement specification, what needs and desires are to be fulfilled, the {gap} functions design, what effects the apparatus should have, and the working design, how the apparatus actually works to fulfil its function. Okay, three presentations, um you can go in any order you choose um.
Marketing: {gap} Mm shall we go in the order that you just did it?
Project Manager: Sure, please do.
Marketing: I dunno. How do I hook my screen up?
Industrial Designer: I think, you might have to disconnect Rose.
Project Manager: Yes I do. Yeah.
User Interface: Well there's a wee a wee plug just just that one there
Marketing: Where does it go? Mm-hmm. Hmm, I'm not supposed to move this,
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Marketing: but {disfmarker}
User Interface: Ah that's it, yep.
Marketing: {gap}
User Interface: And then you have to press function F_ eight
Project Manager: Function, F_ eight, yeah.
User Interface: I think it is on your laptop.
Project Manager: The blue one, F_N_.
Marketing: Where's function? No signal.
Project Manager: Is it plugged in all the way and you screwed it in and {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
Marketing: Ah, wait,'s screw in.
Industrial Designer: I I think you just have to push it in really hard.
Marketing: Push the screw.
User Interface: That's it.
Industrial Designer: Oh, got it.
Project Manager: Mm'kay.
Marketing: Mm alright
Project Manager: It's taking it a little bit {disfmarker}
Marketing: I've never attached to anything.
Industrial Designer: Mm, neither have I.
Project Manager:'Kay there you go.
Marketing: Alright, so,
Industrial Designer: Alright.
Marketing: I don't know if you guys are able to get access to um the report that was online or if I'm the only one who is. But, I don't even know how to play this. No.
Project Manager: Press the little presentation. It's the um {disfmarker} it looks like a Y_ kind of {disfmarker} over there above Draw. There, that one, there you go.
Marketing: Alright. So we're just gonna talk a little bit about the functional requirements that people specified when they were asked. Um I guess Real Reaction did some market research. They had a hundred subjects and their usability lab and they watched them watch T_V_ and recorded the frequency that they used particular buttons and the relevance that those buttons had. What they found was they analysed people's desires and needs. Focusing on their desires, um people specifically said that they thought remotes were ugly {vocalsound}, seventy five per cent of the a hundred subjects noted that and that they {disfmarker} more importantly though, eighty per cent said that they would be willing to pay more for a fancier looking remote. I don't know anything beyond what fancy means,
Industrial Designer: Hmm.
Marketing: but that's particularly of use to us, I think. Um also they did some questions on voice recognition and found that the desire for voice recognition was inversely related to age, so younger people were more inclined to want something with voice recognition, whereas the older people in the like sixty and above segment or so did not really think that they would pay more money for voice recognitions.
Industrial Designer:'Kay.
Marketing: Um people also had certain frustrations, that I think that we could try to take into consideration with our design. That being people k um frustrated with losing their remotes. I think, over fifty percent of the people mentioned that that was their biggest frustration. People are also frustrated with the difficulty it is to learn how to use a remote and I think that ties back to what you were saying before
Industrial Designer: Hmm.
Marketing: just that there's too many buttons, it just needs to be easy to use. It also mentioned something called R_S_I_ and I was hoping someone might be able to inform me as to what R_S_I_ is,
User Interface: Repetitive strain injury.
Marketing: because I don't know.
Project Manager: {gap}
User Interface: Repetitive strain injury.
Marketing: What? Ah. There we go.
User Interface: So if you {disfmarker}
Marketing: Wow. People do not like that. So I guess sort of the carpal tunnel type thing, people do not like that, um the repetitive use, I guess, caused a strain. Um looking at the needs people specified, the problem right now is that people's remotes are not matching their operating behaviour. People are only using ten per cent of the buttons that they have offered to them on their remote. And what people do most often is changing the channel and changing the volume. People also zap like to change the channel, about um sixty five per cent during an hour of use. So we really just need to focus in on those volumes and channel changers rather than things like the audio settings, the screen settings and the channel settings, because they're used much more infrequently and probably just complicate what's going on. So I think that some things that we might wanna think about, the idea of an L_C_D_ screen was brought up although they didn't have any details on what people's preferences on that were, so I dunno know if that's coming to me later, or something like that. But something for us to consider also just the phenomenon that less is more when it comes to the buttons on the remote or what we wanna make easiest to use, make sure that, you know, something like an audio setting isn't given as much importance and visibility on the remote as something like channel changing that's used a lot more often. And basically in order for us to win over to the consumer we just need to focus on what it looks like, that it has a fancy appeal and that it's not ugly {vocalsound} and that it feels like the way they're gonna use it, so it doesn't give them any hand injuries or things like that.
Industrial Designer: Hmm.
Project Manager: Thank you very much. That was that was great.
Industrial Designer: Mm'kay.
Project Manager: Um {vocalsound}'s move on to the next presentation um on effects. Was that you?
Marketing: Hmm.
Project Manager: Great.
Marketing: Yeah, have I unscrewed it?
Project Manager: Push. User interface, right. Interface.
Marketing: Here we go.
User Interface: Cheers.
Marketing: Mm-hmm. And I think that's in the shared, if I did it right, if anyone wants to look at it.
Project Manager: Mm'kay, thank you.
Industrial Designer: Okay, great.
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Okay.
User Interface: Here we go. Right so I'm gonna talk about the technical technical functions design of the remote control um. We need to start by considering what a remote control actually is. It's a device that allows us to produce certain effects on our television, so i it's basically a communication device. We we tell the remote control what we want to do, it sends a message to the television saying change the channel, change the volume, uh yeah, adjust these settings, adjust the brightness. Um how do we actually go about designing a new television remote control? First thing to do is to come up with the design specifications. We need to know what our final product is gonna be like, so we need a a clear idea of exactly what this product does, uh how it works, and what the end-user is gonna want from this product. Um. Oh, a way I'd suggest that we could go about this is by designing uh several different prototypes of user interfaces for this product, um and then uh trying to get some feedback uh about
Marketing: {vocalsound}
User Interface: h how well these particular prototypes work, uh sorta find out what people think of'em. Um using a remote control is is quite a subjective experience. Um,
Project Manager: Hmm.
User Interface: and different different people sort of prefer different things. Um we should remember that remote controls are a a fairly standard piece of equipment. When a users using a remote control, he or she expects the buttons to be in certain places. So in some sense we're gonna we're gonna have to aim for a device which is fairly conventional in design uh so that we're not completely shocking people. But I think within that there is also room for us to introduce novel ideas uh and to make something that's that's perhaps a little bit different, something that stands out. Um also in in designing the user interface we need to consider practicalities. Uh the first of these is is technological ye uh what can we do with the current state of technology as it is. The second is is economic, uh we need to find a balance between features and price. So as you mentioned things like voice recognition would would add to the price uh but it would also im improve the design of the product.
Project Manager: Hmm.
User Interface: So I had a look on the {disfmarker} on the web uh to see if I could find a few examples of existing television remote controls. In analysing these we can consider what what things {disfmarker} what's good about them, uh what things do they get right, what's bad about them, what's wrong with'em, um how we can improve on the designs that that that I found and what can we do to make our product stand out from from the large majority of remote controls. Here's two examples uh probably at the extreme ends of the spectrum.
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
User Interface: Um on the left here we've got uh an engineering-based design for a remote control,
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
User Interface: so it's one that's got lots of buttons, it's it's fully featured, everything you might possibly want to do is there, you know, it's got forward, backwards, up, down, channel numbers, volume, uh freeze frame. Yeah, it's it's fully featured and it might take a while to get to learn to use it, but once you've learned it you can {disfmarker} you can do whatever you want with your T_V_. The one on the right is a lot more basic. It's just got the essential functions of the T_V_ changing the channel, play, stop, volume. It would be a lot quicker to learn to use it, but again th it's it's swings and roundabouts. There are disadvantages, you can't use it say to to freeze the television picture. Uh there's a lot of features that are missing from that remote control. So we've got to to find our {disfmarker} find a way of striking a balance between the two. Um as I said before, remote controls are subjective, different people want want different things. Um personally wa what I want from a remote control is a device that's simple, it it's easy to use, uh it's got big buttons for doing the things I do most often, changing the volume, changing the channel. It it does everything that I need it to uh, as I said before, I'm quite lazy, I don't wanna walk across the room just to adjust my television. I also want something that that looks cool, um and that that feels good, that's ergonomically designed.
Project Manager: Mm'kay. Thank you very much. That was very useful. {vocalsound} It's funny to see the {vocalsound} drastic difference between those two remotes. {vocalsound} Um.
Industrial Designer: Hmm.
Project Manager: And neither of them were very pretty, you know?
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Marketing: No.
Industrial Designer: I think that could be our selling point.
Project Manager: Mm.
Marketing: A fashion fashion remote.
Industrial Designer: Right.
User Interface: I think there's there's certainly a market for technology that looks cool.
Project Manager: Mm.
User Interface: And I think that's that's why companies like Apple've've've made a lot of progress.
Marketing: Mm-hmm.
Industrial Designer: Hmm.
Marketing: Yeah.
Industrial Designer: Right, I really can't see what I'm doing, so does anyone have a {disfmarker}
Project Manager: You {disfmarker} there it is.
Industrial Designer: Ah-ha, look at that, showing up already.
Project Manager: Lovely.
Marketing: So wait, did it let you go on the Internet or was that just what it let you see?
User Interface: Uh that was just on the d on the company web site, yeah.
Marketing: Okay.'Cause I was like googling
Project Manager: Hmm.
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
Marketing: and then I'm like wait {vocalsound} it won't let me google. {vocalsound}
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: Alright um {disfmarker} No, how do I play again?
Project Manager: Um the {disfmarker} it's right above Draw. There are three thingy if {disfmarker} it's way at the bottom. Under three icons
Industrial Designer: Ah.
Project Manager: and it's the one that looks like a desk. Yeah, that one. There are Y_s {gap}.
Industrial Designer: Okay. So this is our working design presentation. Um I had a bit of {disfmarker} some issues with this, because I wasn't able to find everything I needed, but I guess that's {disfmarker} we're still in early stages. Um so, yeah, this is this. Though th the thing about working design is the {disfmarker} what we're trying to do as a working design is figure out how the aparata apparatus can fulfil its function. Um one of the examples that kept coming up for me is that a coffee grinder. It works because it converts electrical energy to grinding the beans and then you put the bean through a filter and that filters out, and then you get coffee at the end that's nice and hot because of the combination of electrical energy and then the other things that are brought in to make it work. Don't know if I'm explaining that very well, but {disfmarker} how do I get to the next s ah. So h the method as um working designers figure out what you need to make it fulfil this practical function, what what needs to be done and how do we convert all the elements to make that done.
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: So wha the easiest thing to do is to break down all the points at which you need something to happen. So you make a schematic of the way that the the energy is converted tsh towards this practical function. And then I think the easiest thing to do is gonna be work on each task separately. So um {disfmarker}
Project Manager: You just press {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Uh. Uh.
Project Manager: yeah, just click. That'll be fine.
Industrial Designer: So the findings that I got uh very {disfmarker} just very briefly is that you have a choice of the way that the information is projected to the receiver and in my opinion infra-red is the best way to do that'cause you don't need a sight line. So that's one thing we're gonna work on. Um the user interface is critical here, because a lot of the things that happen in a remote control happen through the chip that controls {disfmarker} that converts the electrical energy into data, which then goes through the infra-red, so the the chip that uh I think Ian is designing, is gonna be crucial. And really it all comes down to the to the user, because they're the one that's controlling most of the working design. So the components that we find here are the energy source, you know the battery or whatever that's gonna m make it work, then the chip, which converts the data, the user that's controlling the chip, and the infra-red bulb that's gonna let us move the data to the receiver. So you have four main components and they are designed sort of like this. You have your energy source right there which then um brings uh energy or information to the chip, which is also controlled by the users. You have energy going to the user who's controlling the chip {disfmarker} ooh's not what I wanted to do uh uh.
Project Manager: Um yeah use that thing {gap} you can go back, previous.
Industrial Designer: Previous. Sorry about that, guys.
Project Manager: {vocalsound} Pardon.
Industrial Designer: Oh.
Project Manager: Oh, well.
Industrial Designer: No, no, no, no, no.
Project Manager: Okay.
Industrial Designer: Okay, let's just get back to my schematic here.
Project Manager: Ye Double click on it. With the right {disfmarker} with the left hand one.
Industrial Designer: W yeah, yeah. I think it's frozen. Here. Don't show me that tip again.
Project Manager: {vocalsound} There we are.
Industrial Designer: There we are. Sorry about this, guys.
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: I'm kind of pathetic with things like this. Um alright. So you have your energy source, your user interface who's controlling the chip, the chip also uses the energy, and the chip through the use of the user interface is gonna control the switch which will work your infra-red bulb, which will then bring the data to the receiver. So hopefully that makes sense for everyone in my kind of garbled way.
Project Manager: Mm-hmm.
Industrial Designer: This is the the parts of the working design that need to be figured out. And {vocalsound} personal preferences, besides the fact that I can't spell, we need a long-lasting energy source, people don't wanna be changing it a lot. We need a chip that works well with the user interface, that isn't too complicated. We need a straightforward interface, like Ian was saying, simple, not overwhelming it with information and we need a reliable and clear infra-red signal, so that you're not waving your remote around
Project Manager: Mm-hmm.
Industrial Designer: and having to get frustrated and go do it by hands. So that's pretty much it for the working design.
Project Manager: Excellent. {gap} So, um.
Industrial Designer: Rose, do you think you can give me a hand with this?
Project Manager: Yes, absolutely. Ah I can never tell which way to turn these things.
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
Project Manager: Lefty loosey, righty tighty, right?
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
Marketing: {vocalsound}
User Interface: What's up?
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: {vocalsound} Lefty loosey, righty tighty.
User Interface: Lefty loosey. Uh.
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
User Interface: {vocalsound} Never heard that before,
Project Manager: {vocalsound} Oh yes.
User Interface: that's good. {vocalsound}
Marketing: {vocalsound}
User Interface: I'll think of that every time now.
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: It's gonna stick in your head.
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Marketing: Yeah, that's a good one it'll stick with you.
Project Manager: Mm'kay. Um I have nothing on my screen. Just a sec. Here we are.
Industrial Designer: Mm. Ooh,
Project Manager: Okay, yeah, it's fine.
Industrial Designer: no signal.
Project Manager: Okay, requirements. We have a couple new requirements that I was just e-mailed right before the meeting and that we have to keep in in um in mind as we're creating this.
Industrial Designer: Okay.
Project Manager: We didn't bring it up yet, or at all in the meetings so far, but we're not gonna work with teletext because um {disfmarker} well it {disfmarker} that's been taken over by the internet, so we're not gonna worry about um {disfmarker} we're not gonna worry about that.
Marketing: What's teletext?
Project Manager: Um.
Industrial Designer: Uh, it's a British thing.
Marketing: Oh. Oh,
User Interface: You don't have it in the States?
Marketing: so {disfmarker}
Project Manager: It {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: No. {vocalsound}
Project Manager: no. W d could {disfmarker} would you care to explain it?
User Interface: Oh, I didn't realise. Um yeah, it's like a {disfmarker} I suppose it's kind of similar to a very very basic web browser. Um you have like you have uh numbers on your remote control, uh y and you type in the page number you want,
Marketing: Mm-hmm.
User Interface: so like you type a hundred on your remote control and this this kind of index appears on the television screen with just some some text and some very blocky looking graphics on it. And you just type numbers to go to different pages and it gives you information, mostly rather boring stuff like what's on T_V_ next and share prices and that kind of thing.
Marketing: {gap}
Industrial Designer: S {vocalsound} Lottery numbers and sport scores.
User Interface: Yep, news headlines.
Industrial Designer: But if you ever see the T_V_ saying like go to page one sixty on Ceefax now, that's what they're talking about.
Project Manager: How?
User Interface: It's earl it's pretty old technology.
Marketing: Oh.
User Interface: It's like nineteen eighties.
Project Manager: Okay.
Marketing: That explains a lot.
Industrial Designer: I have no idea why we don't have it, but {disfmarker}
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Marketing: That's good.
Project Manager: Interesting. Okay um, well, we're not gonna {disfmarker} the management has decided we're not gonna work with that. Um {disfmarker}
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Okay um and we're also gonna w like your question earlier um whether this is going to be t for television, video, or etcetera. Just for television. That's what we're focused on.
User Interface: Right.
Project Manager: Um otherwise becomes to complex, we wanna get this out um very quickly. We only have a a short amount of time.
Industrial Designer:'Kay.
Project Manager: Um and finally there's more marketing, I think, um, our corporate image has to be recognisable. So while we're gonna make it look pretty we need to use our colour and our slogan i in the new design.
Industrial Designer: Mm.
User Interface: So what's our corporate image like? It's {disfmarker} It's kind of yellow colour with uh we put fashion in electronics.
Project Manager: Looks like, yeah, kind of a yellow and black and we have that {disfmarker} the emphasis on the R_s in um {disfmarker}
User Interface: It's like double R_.
Project Manager: mm-hmm.
User Interface: Yeah.
Project Manager: But it's, yeah, we put the um fashion in electronics. So we gotta keep that in that in mind.
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: Okay, so we want something that looks good
Project Manager: Yep. Yep.
Industrial Designer: and is yellow.
Project Manager: Yeah, or {vocalsound} ha maybe some buttons could be yellow. Like, we can we can play around with it a little bit.
Industrial Designer: Okay.
Project Manager: Um. Okay, we need to talk about our functions and our target group. We need to decide who our target group is. You um in your analysis of different market um {disfmarker} of the marketing, you identified that different groups wanted different things
Marketing: Mm-hmm.
Project Manager: or had certain preferences, for example that um that older people didn't really care for um voice recognition, but younger people did.
Marketing: Mm-hmm.
Project Manager: Um and so who are we aiming this at?
Industrial Designer: Well if we're gonna say that function um fashion {disfmarker} we put the fashion in in electronics then you {disfmarker} automatically, I think, a sort of younger group that {disfmarker} that's {disfmarker} who's gonna be attracted to this.
Marketing: {vocalsound} Yes, I do think, who's gonna have the money to buy that also, that one?
Project Manager: Mm-hmm. It's gonna be twenty five Euro remember, so um it has to be avai marketable to um whomever it is.
Industrial Designer: Mm-hmm.
User Interface: Is it {disfmarker} is it something that's gonna be sold separately from the television or is it something that comes w with a television?'Cause that would affect the way that we market it.
Project Manager: Well at least right now what we're doing is um deciding on just the remote itself, so it will probably be sold separately, twenty five Euro by itself.
User Interface: Right. Right, okay.
Marketing: The only break-down that I was given in terms of age was the voice activation and basically there's a big jump, after thirty five people don't really care if it has voice, so it's like basically fifteen to thirty five that think that that's a good idea.
Industrial Designer: Mm-hmm.
Marketing: I dunno I'm gonna be given any other numbers broken down in terms of age later, but if that's sort of the only quality that we have that is divided into age then we would wanna stick between the fifteen and thirty five range.
Industrial Designer: Yeah, that's probably uh a population w quite a little bit of disposable income for use on technology anyway, so that might be a fairly good target group for us.
User Interface: Yeah.
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Now, those are {disfmarker} that's all specific for speech recognition. Are we gonna use that as one of our functions?
User Interface: Um.
Industrial Designer: Mm.
User Interface: I I would say no, because it's gonna add too much to the price. Especially if we are marketing it as a separate product, people are gonna be paying
Project Manager: Mm-hmm.
User Interface: uh, well, uh we've got a price limit of {disfmarker} was it twelve twelve and a half Euros for {disfmarker} to produce it?
Project Manager: Mm.
Industrial Designer: To produce it, yeah.
Project Manager: To produce it, yes.
User Interface: And I wonder if we can get voice recognition into that twelve and a half Euros without having to make too many other compromises.
Project Manager: Mm.
Marketing: But what else are we gonna put, I mean not that I'm really gung-ho about it, I don't know what else you can put in a remote to make it technologically advanced though. So like other than just making it look good, how is it {disfmarker}
User Interface: Yeah.
Industrial Designer: Hmm.
Marketing: I mean it can look really great and still have the same up-n-down buttons
Industrial Designer: But {disfmarker} right.
Marketing: and why's anyone gonna buy a new remote?
Industrial Designer: Well but why are we why are we aiming for a technological advancement? Everything we're talking about is ease of use and simple and that doesn't necessarily mean more technology,
Marketing: Mm-hmm.
Project Manager: That's a good thing to keep in mind.
Industrial Designer: in fact it could use {disfmarker} it could mean, not. If {vocalsound} {disfmarker} they might be overwhelmed with with remotes that have too many buttons and too much technology.
Marketing: If someone's looking to buy a new remote, don't they want like an upgrade? I dunno.
Project Manager: Upgrade? Well, we can look for {disfmarker} we can look at upgrade or we can look at um user-friendly.
Industrial Designer: Yeah, simplification.
Project Manager: Simplification,
Industrial Designer: They could have a crap remote
User Interface: Yeah.
Marketing: Mm-hmm.
Project Manager: so {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: that came with their T_V_ that's just impossible to use, or maybe it broke, or maybe they're just missing it.
Marketing: Mm-hmm.
Project Manager: Uh-huh, mm. And we also need to talk about if we're only gonna have the very simple ones or also have the other ones just separate somehow or {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Hmm.
User Interface: Yeah.
Marketing: Can you like {disfmarker} I mean this may be too complicated, but, I wish I had something to explain it, like if it was just a simple, either this way or this way, that had like the main buttons and then you could like pull something out, kind of and like you got the rest the buttons,
Industrial Designer: Ooh.
Marketing: but the rest of them like went in.
User Interface: The remote {disfmarker}
Marketing: Do you know what I'm saying?
Project Manager: Kind of pull out of the side.
User Interface: There are remote controls like that, yeah. Like some T_V_s they have a sort of uh a sliding screen on the remote control of it
Project Manager: Mm.
User Interface: that hides all the complicated buttons.
Industrial Designer: Ooh.
User Interface: So if you wanna do something complicated like programme your television or re-tune it, then you you open up this little hatch or or slide the screen down
Marketing: Mm-hmm.
Project Manager: Mm-hmm.
User Interface: and there's all the {disfmarker} all the special buttons.
Marketing:'Cause then's like people who don't wanna ever look at them, never even have to see them
Project Manager: Mm-hmm.
Industrial Designer: Mm-hmm.
Marketing: and if you like get the instruction manual that comes with it and you just don't even read it then you'll never even know that those things can pull out.
User Interface: Yeah.
Project Manager: Mm-hmm.
Marketing: And you're a happy person and everyone else doesn't have to have like two remotes, one that has the easy ones and one that has
Project Manager: Mm-hmm.
Industrial Designer: Yeah, that's a good idea.
User Interface: Yeah.
Marketing: more complicated ones,
User Interface: I think that's a good idea, yeah.
Marketing: but's all still in one.
Industrial Designer: Mm.
Project Manager: Um we have to be careful that that that doesn't impede um the chip transmitting information, but um that's gonna be mostly technological thing. Um.
Marketing: Yeah.
Industrial Designer: Good point.
User Interface: Yeah.
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
Project Manager: Okay um, so what are we emphasising? I {disfmarker} what in this project?
User Interface: Si simplicity and fashion.
Project Manager: Simplicity and fashion.
Marketing: I think simplicity, fashion.
Industrial Designer: Yeah mm.
Project Manager: Okay, those are very good goals, I think, um that we have to keep in mind in {disfmarker} with everything we do. Simplicity and fashion and, yeah, {disfmarker} or usability speci however you wanna say that, which includes um an emphasis on making the infra-red very functional, so that you don't have to travel around a lot.
User Interface: Yeah.
Marketing: Mm-hmm.
User Interface: Yeah.
Project Manager: Um.
Marketing: What can you do to like make the infra-red more functional, like why would it not be? I'm just wondering.
Project Manager: I think it's a lot {vocalsound} to do with battery, but that's just my {disfmarker}
Marketing: Okay.
Industrial Designer: The battery and that {disfmarker} I think that the chip takes the data and presents it well, without sort of scattering.
Project Manager: Mm-hmm.
Marketing: So's just the quality of the chip.
Industrial Designer: Yeah. I think so.
Marketing: Okay.
Industrial Designer: The quality {vocalsound} uh quality of all the components really, I mean, we can't really do anything {disfmarker} shoddy work,'cause it's
User Interface: Yeah.
Industrial Designer: gonna be visible down the line.
Project Manager: So our target group, we're saying, fifteen to thirty five?
Marketing: Well, I dunno how useful that number is if we're not doing {disfmarker}
Project Manager: S voice recognition, which I kind of I kind of feel like voice recognition is not necessary in a remote control,
Marketing: Yeah. Yeah. I don't.
Project Manager: like it might be necessary for a T_V_ but not for the remote c, you know.
User Interface: It's, yeah, it's pretty it's pretty high-tech.
Industrial Designer: Mm-mm.
Project Manager: Seems a little bit {disfmarker} Mm-hmm. Yeah,
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
Project Manager: and it might be too expensive.
User Interface: {gap}
Marketing: And if the whole idea is you're using a remote then why would you have voice,
Project Manager: Mm-hmm.
Marketing: like you know what I mean and then it's like you wouldn't need a remote you'd just talk to your T_V_.
Project Manager: Yeah. {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: Ooh. {vocalsound}
User Interface: It's for, like, the ultimately lazy people,
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
User Interface: who can't even be bothered to pick up the remote.
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
Marketing: Mm yeah.
Industrial Designer: I
Marketing: Maybe {disfmarker} I mean if I get m more numbers, I'll e-mail you before the next meeting in terms of ages. But this doesn't divide up anything and there was only a hundred subjects also,
Project Manager: Mm-hmm.
Industrial Designer: Mm-hmm.
Marketing: which isn't, I mean, really isn't that representative, especially if it's a hundred subjects that th they then can subdivide into age groups that means there's very few in each age group, so {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Yeah, but I th I think regardless we're we're aiming for the under sixty five or something.
Marketing: {gap}
Project Manager: Under sixty five, okay,
User Interface: Yep.
Project Manager: that's a good start. Um. I'd say we're {disfmarker} uh can we narrow it down to maybe um teenagers and families?'Cause that would go up to like fifty?
Industrial Designer: Or like single professionals or something.
Project Manager: Okay, single {disfmarker}
Marketing: Twenty to like fifty five.
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
Marketing: I dunno.
Project Manager: It's it's hard to narrow it down.
Industrial Designer: It's really hard to figure out right now.
User Interface: I think the product appeals across a quite a broad range of ages.
Project Manager: Mm-hmm.
User Interface: I mean, we we said simplicity is is one of the features, so it's going to appeal to people, maybe people who have problems with technology, you know, people who get scared by having lots of buttons,
Project Manager: Okay.
User Interface: and that might be older people,
Project Manager: Mm-hmm.
User Interface: but then we've also got fashion, which is something that definitely appeals to younger people.
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
Marketing: Well maybe we don't have to defi define the target group by the demographic of age,
Project Manager: Right.
Marketing: maybe we can define it by like the demographic of like h t how much money they have to spend or something like that,
User Interface: Yeah. Yeah aim for a {disfmarker} an income group.
Industrial Designer: That's a good point.
Marketing: like, well
Project Manager: Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.
Marketing: obviously it has to be someone who owns a television,
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
Marketing: and like how recently have they bought their television like that sort of thing.
Industrial Designer: Mm.
Project Manager: So maybe it's more useful to d d to define objectives like fashion and simplicity than to find specific target group as far as age is {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Yeah, t probably.
User Interface: Yeah.
Project Manager: because, yeah, things so different will appeal to different people, but {disfmarker} Okay. Um oh, there're a couple functions {disfmarker} do we want something so that {disfmarker} do we want some kind of thing to find it if it's lost? Like a button on a T_V_ you can press
Industrial Designer: Mm.
Marketing: Yeah.
Project Manager: and it'll ring or something, I don't know like {disfmarker} or beep?
Marketing: H I mean, like I said before, fifty per cent of of the fru f like frustration someone can have that was the biggest one and half the people said that happened and we all mentioned it before we knew about it.
Project Manager: Mm-hmm.
User Interface: Yeah.
Marketing: And if we're talking about making something easy that sort of goes along with it so it wouldn't be like a random thing to sort of add in.
Industrial Designer: Mm.
Marketing: It would be relevant to like the overall goal I think,
Project Manager: Mm.
Industrial Designer: Yeah, that'll probably be good.
Marketing: so {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Okay, we have to {disfmarker} we have about four minutes left to define our functions. So let's do that quickly. Um so we want something to keep it from getting lost.
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
User Interface: Yep.
Project Manager: And {vocalsound} we want um we want large buttons for the essential things. Large, accessible buttons for the essentials.
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
User Interface: Yeah.
Project Manager: We want a possibility to um to get um a possibility to get the extra functions.
Industrial Designer: Mm-hmm.
User Interface: Yeah.
Marketing: {vocalsound}
User Interface: Which are kind of hidden away in some way or well not hidden but they're uh they're not as prominent as the main features.
Project Manager: Mm-hmm.
Marketing: Hmm.
Project Manager: Um, yeah, hidden way. And we also want it to be fashionable, which I'm not sure if that's a function so much as a um yeah {disfmarker}
Marketing: {gap} on your coffee table, it's not like an eye sore, that kind of thing.
Project Manager: Mm-hmm.
Industrial Designer: Yeah. Alright.
Project Manager: Okay, do it. Any other essential functions that we need? Battery? Do we need a long-life battery?
Industrial Designer: Battery battery use. Yeah, but I think that goes in with simplicity and ease of use really.
Marketing: Yeah.
Project Manager: But we might as well.
Marketing: So you never have to change the battery.
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
User Interface: We should maybe investigate whether it needs a battery at all. I suspect the remote control does need a battery,
Project Manager: Yeah, I would imagine.
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
User Interface: but I dunno if you can {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Just'cause it is an electronic device, the {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Mm.
User Interface: Yeah.
Industrial Designer: It {disfmarker} I think it does. I don't I don't think of a way you can operate a chip and convert that much data without without one.
User Interface: Yeah, without the energy, yeah.
Industrial Designer: But you could maybe have it in a little charging station like a mobile phone, or like a little cradle for your iPod.
User Interface: Yeah, that's that's possible. Yeah.
Industrial Designer: You could {disfmarker} we could maybe do that instead.
Project Manager: Charging.
Industrial Designer: So you don't ha you got like a rechargeable battery.
User Interface: Yeah.
Industrial Designer: I dunno, that might contribute to less people losing it too if it {vocalsound} it stays in one place.
Project Manager: Mm-hmm.
Marketing: Mm.
Project Manager: We have to think about um space in living-rooms, too, like'cause they're {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Mm.
Project Manager: I mean, would you put it on top of the T_V_? I don't know, just think {disfmarker} okay, that's {vocalsound} that's a good idea, we'll keep it. Think it's {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Yeah. That's just off the top of my head.
Project Manager: And maybe fun. Okay. Um'kay we're gonna conclude now, has everyone said their functions and {disfmarker}'kay.
User Interface: Yep.
Project Manager: Um after the meeting we're gonna each complete a sks um a questionnaire and a summaries {disfmarker} summary. I don't know what summarisation. Um and then we'll have our lunch break. After that we have thirty minutes of individual work. Um I'll make sure to put up um the minutes and the project documentation and including these PowerPoint slides. If everyone could do that as well, that'd be great. Um you each have individual actions, I_ um I_D_ Industrial Design you've your components concept, User Interface, the user interface concept, market trend wa watching.
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: And as as per last time you'll get specific incrat instructions from your personal coach e-mailed to you. And hopefully, I hope, next time you'll be able to access more of the web site that they they seem to tell you that you could. It's kinda frustrating,
Industrial Designer: Yeah, who knows.
Project Manager: but um {disfmarker} Be sure to note any frustrations or any um issues that come up in your um in your um summary.
Industrial Designer: Okay
Project Manager: Mm'kay?
Industrial Designer: Sounds good.
Project Manager: Great seeing y'all. {vocalsound} {vocalsound}
Marketing: It's good.
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Marketing: Did you um {disfmarker} were you able to like put yours in the group folder?
Industrial Designer: Yes, I just did that.
Marketing: Okay.
Industrial Designer: Hopefully it is there for people.
Marketing: Yep.
Industrial Designer: Yeah?
Project Manager: Looks like there are um {disfmarker} looks like there's a second one kind of of mine that's {disfmarker} that I didn't do,
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
Project Manager: it's from like an earlier project, I think so um {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Okay.
Marketing: Where is that? Yours is {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Under the shared folder, I don't know it might not even be under yours as well.
Industrial Designer: Technical. So
Project Manager: Projects.
Industrial Designer: in there we have technical functions presentation, working design presentation and the functional requirements. At least that's what I have in.
Marketing: I only have three, I just have like our three. Yeah.
Industrial Designer: Yeah, that's what I have as well, R Rose {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Okay. You don't have mine?
Industrial Designer: So.
Marketing: No, but that's'cause I think yours is in the e-mail separate, like it's not on the server.
Project Manager: S
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
Project Manager: Mm.
Marketing: But if I open it and then save it, probably will be there. Oh wait, never mind you can't save it to the {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Okay. Well I'll figure that out in the meantime.
Industrial Designer: Okay.
Marketing: Okay.","This was the second meeting with functional design discussion purpose. Firstly, the group gave three individual presentations on working design, technical functions and functional requirements. They mentioned the importance of the fancy appeal, the practicality and the quality of components. Then, the group had a discussion about general requirements on the remote control. The group decided to market the remote as a separate product and focused on the user-friendly as well as simplicity, instead of too much technological advancement. Also, they agreed to target on income group and would add extra functionalities like keep lost and rechargeable stations for the remote control.",qmsum
"Why did Industrial Designer not agree to what Marketing and User Interface said before?
Project Manager: Wait for the marketing director actually, so. Anyways. Uh. See, shall we wait? I'm not sure if he's late or delayed or whatever, so I'm gonna start soon, we have now {disfmarker} don't have much time anyway.
User Interface: Oh, there he is.
Industrial Designer: Okay,
Marketing: Yes.
Project Manager: There you are,
Industrial Designer: we {disfmarker}
Marketing: Sorry,
Project Manager: okay.
Marketing: a little bit of pl little problem with computer.
Project Manager: Uh no problem. We're about to start, so have a seat. Okay, welcome again.
Marketing: {vocalsound} {gap}.
Project Manager: Today, functional design phase. I'll take you over the minutes of last last meeting. Okay, that was just to get to know each other,
Marketing: Uh.
Project Manager: have a little thoughts on what your vision is and {disfmarker} on this project, so {disfmarker} I put the minutes on the {disfmarker} I made on the on the p the the project share, so if you wanna review them, they're there. I will do so after every meeting, so if you have some information you wanna take back you can find it there. Anyways, um today three presentations, from every one of you. Um after that I got some new project requirements from project board, so we're gonna go af go after {disfmarker} over this later. But I wanna start with uh stuff you did first, so we can see what everybody came up with. And after that we can have the new requirements and share some thoughts, so. Who would like {disfmarker} wanna go first?
Marketing: Yeah, sure, no problem.
Project Manager: Take it.
User Interface: Go ahead.
Marketing: Um there was a little problem with my computer so not uh the whole uh presentation uh {disfmarker}
Project Manager: {vocalsound} Anyway, let's see what you have.
Marketing: Yeah. Um {disfmarker} Okay,
Project Manager: Uh it's still a bit open.
Marketing: I want to open the my s oh no.
Project Manager: You should close it on your own notebook, I guess. Yeah. So there?
Marketing: Oh no,
Project Manager: Okay.
Marketing: that's okay. Uh slide show. Yes. The functional requirements, it's uh {vocalsound} uh very important for uh the user, he he wants to {disfmarker} yeah. The the method we used uh it it's not m not a slide, because it went wrong, but the method we use uh, um {vocalsound} we tested it w uh with uh a hundred uh men, and we asked them to w uh what the remote uh f feel uh like and uh what what's uh important. Uh {disfmarker}
Project Manager: If I can cut in, is it people or men? {vocalsound}
Marketing: People,
Project Manager: Is it people, okay.
Marketing: sorry.
Project Manager:'Cause I thought it was only men,
Marketing: Both women and men,
Project Manager: so {disfmarker}
Marketing: yeah.
Project Manager:'Kay.
Marketing: Okay. Uh the findings um uh {vocalsound} seventy five percent of the users find most remote controls ugly. Um {disfmarker}
User Interface: That's pretty shocking uh. {vocalsound}
Project Manager: So we have to s we have to do something about that.
Marketing: Yeah, and {disfmarker} yeah, most th th they want to spend money for a better system, for better remote control, so we can do uh a l a little uh nice things with it, and um they use {disfmarker} yeah, they use zap a lot, um uh fifty percent say they only {disfmarker} So that's the most important things.
Project Manager: Okay.
Marketing: Um {disfmarker} oh yeah, not all of it is it on mine on my PowerPoint presentation,
Project Manager: Okay, just talk ahead.
Marketing: but um uh the relevant buttons are the power, the channel selection and the volume selection.
Project Manager: Mm-hmm.
Marketing: It's uh the most basic buttons that a user wants uh {vocalsound} to use. Uh less important is tel teletext,
Project Manager: Mm-hmm. {vocalsound}
Marketing: uh um they use it, but it's not uh very uh important uh on the scale of zero to ten they six and a half uh
Project Manager: Okay, that's okay.
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Marketing: and {disfmarker} but not important is the channel selection, the the {vocalsound} {disfmarker} hmm?
Project Manager: That's a little weird.
Marketing: Oh, {vocalsound}
User Interface: {vocalsound} Which channel selection?
Marketing: the the {disfmarker} no no no no no, that's very important, but uh w and not important in the audio settings, display settings
Project Manager: Okay,
Marketing: and uh {disfmarker}
Project Manager: we can we can hide those under a menu or something,
User Interface: Oh, okay.
Marketing: Yeah.
Project Manager: okay.
Marketing: {vocalsound} Um new preferences preferences. Uh um um beep to find your control, was {disfmarker}
Project Manager: That's like a button on your T_V_?
Marketing: that was {gap} in the test, the the most people uh f find it uh irritating uh when they cannot find a rem their remote control,
Project Manager: Remote, okay.
Industrial Designer: Mm.
Marketing: so uh I think it's a bee beep to sound it and uh you can find it. And another thing uh they want was uh speech recognition um so they can say uh what they want to {disfmarker} let's go to channel one and uh that's uh kind of things.
Project Manager: Okay.
Marketing: And they want maybe an uh L_C_D_ screen um to to look it um wh what's on every channel uh and uh what do I want with it?
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: We wanna have a little preview on the remote control. Preview what's on the channel.
Marketing: {vocalsound} Yeah.
Project Manager: Okay.
User Interface: Is that manageable?'Cause it sounds pretty expensive too.
Project Manager: That sounds too {disfmarker}
Marketing: Yeah.
Project Manager: It's possible, but uh I think it's expensive, but do continue.
User Interface: Okay.
Marketing: Yeah. Um {disfmarker} Uh my personal preferences is uh a button for my favourite channel, so I can uh I dunno, so I can zap to my uh f uh quick uh to my favourite channel wh what I uh {disfmarker} so, the remote mu must see or um must um {vocalsound} see wha what mine preferences are for which channel,
Project Manager: Okay, you don't set it yourself,
Marketing: so I can zap t to {disfmarker}
Project Manager: it just remembers the channel that you are on most, for example.
Marketing: What?
Project Manager: You want the {disfmarker} you want it to be programmed, for example y programmed f
Marketing: Yeah.
Project Manager: or you want it to recognise your favourite channel?
Marketing: Yeah.
Project Manager: Let's see, you you spend twenty minutes each day on that channel,
Marketing: Recognise {disfmarker}
Project Manager: so it recognises your favourite channel.
Marketing: Yeah. Yeah, that's uh what my personal preference like.
Project Manager: Okay, so it's it it does {disfmarker} it recognise itself, you don't have to set it {disfmarker}
Marketing: No,
Project Manager: Okay.
Marketing: itself. Maybe it's easier to {vocalsound} to sell it, but {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Okay.
Marketing: I don't know it's manageable, but we will uh we will see.
Project Manager: I see.
Marketing: Yeah, it's a little bit uh it's the end of it.
Project Manager: Okay.
Marketing: It's a little bit uh I lost it,
User Interface: Okay.
Marketing: the computer uh crashed,
Project Manager: {vocalsound} No problem, it's it's okay,
Marketing: so.
Project Manager: that's {disfmarker} Yeah, go ahead.
User Interface: Shall I go? Okay.
Marketing: Yeah.
User Interface: So, some technical functions.
Marketing: Darn computer.
User Interface: Basically I have some issues which you discussed earlier. Uh let's just start with the method.
Marketing: Yeah.
User Interface: {vocalsound} It sounds really easy, what does the user do, what does the th remote control do, but there are quite some issues. So the things I'm going to concentrate on are the user aspect, because the technical aspect, that's pretty much covered. We can do that. What goes wrong {vocalsound} at the user. Gets the remote control. Where is the remote control? We've all had it once, I want to watch some television,
Marketing: Yeah.
User Interface: where's the remote control? That was one of your ideas which you posted in the network folder,
Marketing: Yeah.
Project Manager: That seems very good.
User Interface: a really good idea. Uh these are just the issues. I come to some uh personal experience, findings, possible solutions later. Searches for the button. There are many buttons on a remote control which are not clear. Uh so either we lose those or we try to make it a little bit more clear.
Project Manager: Mm-hmm.
User Interface: Uh also symbols tend to fade after a while.
Marketing: Mm uh.
User Interface: There's nothing more annoying than faded symbols, because you don't know which channel is this button, so possibly we could find uh something for that,
Project Manager: Okay, so have it more {disfmarker} make it more durable actually. Okay.
User Interface: yes. Uh covered that. Oh yes, user presses the button. Um usually when you have a lot of buttons, buttons are small. So you press more once remote control goes kablouey or something like that,
Project Manager: Okay, so the buttons should be {disfmarker}
User Interface: so we have to pay attention not to put too mun too many buttons on uh the remote control. {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Mm-hmm. Yeah.
User Interface: And possibly also the size, so more important buttons, bigger
Project Manager: Wow. The s Yeah. Make it {disfmarker} make them bigger.
User Interface: si
Project Manager: Even more durable uh.
User Interface: So this is basically what I h had in mind in the {disfmarker} fade-proof symbols, locator, a sound, uh so clear we should stick to existing symbols, but maybe we could do a little uh investigation to see whether some symbols are uh {disfmarker} need to be replaced by others. Uh {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Okay.
User Interface: This I pretty much covered. {vocalsound} So what we want to go to is not this one,
Project Manager: Yeah, it's true.
User Interface: but more {disfmarker} less buttons, easy, some bigger buttons.
Marketing: Yeah.
User Interface: that's basically uh what I had in mind. So
Project Manager: Yeah, that's clear.
User Interface: This is not the final design,
Project Manager: No, of course uh {disfmarker}
User Interface: this is just a general idea of how I'd like to see uh basically the general idea.
Project Manager: Yeah. I must say that it {disfmarker} Hmm.
User Interface: {vocalsound} So that was it.
Project Manager: That was it. Okay, that was good. So we agree on the the part that we need to get something on the on the remote to find it somewhere and increase it {disfmarker} the durability of of the thing,
User Interface: Yeah, I think it's a really good idea.
Project Manager: so {disfmarker}
User Interface: Yeah.
Project Manager: The other aspects, we'll just see how {disfmarker} what you came up with and what's possible for that budget.
User Interface: Yeah.
Project Manager: Okay.
Industrial Designer: Okay, that's fine. Um. Okay, now work a little with me. Okay. Well,
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: let's start it as it is. Okay, uh the method. There are a few questions that need to be answered, uh you already uh talked about it a little bit. Which buttons are wanted, uh is our remote control universal or should it be programmable. Uh if it should be programmeab grammeale then we need um something like a mode that you can switch it. Because then the buttons have to send out a different signal then they would normally do.
Project Manager: Mm-hmm.
Industrial Designer: And uh how big is the remote control uh going to be? I'll tell you why that's important to me. Um there are a lot of technical parts in the remote control, so uh uh that's {vocalsound} why I also would like to say uh go a little bit easy on the designs, uh I heard ab uh you talking about beeps and about uh video screens, but uh the material inside and the technical aspects are quite complex already.
Project Manager: Mm-hmm.
Industrial Designer: So keep in mind that everything that you keep uh {disfmarker} think of, it has to b to be built.
Project Manager: Yeah. {vocalsound} Of course, hmm.
Industrial Designer: So it's {disfmarker} that's not as easy as it s might look like.
User Interface: Okay.
Industrial Designer: Uh material study, I'm working on that um for the the costs. I have to check out how far I can go with that. Normally, a circuit board is made of fibreglass uh and the wires are made of copper. Uh that is how it is done and all the remote controls work that way, I think we can just go on with that. Um then I've read more integration of materials means less cost for the production. The more we can make uh at once uh in one piece, uh that is cheaper.
Project Manager: You mean integrate them all into the circuit board. Okay.
Industrial Designer: Exactly, so if we make a circuit board with the the connections already on it, then that's cheaper.
Project Manager: {vocalsound} Yeah, okay.
Industrial Designer: So we have to {vocalsound} make something that's not too difficult in design again.
Project Manager: So you have {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: This is what look like uh looks like if you press one button, so this is not the entire thing. You have the the power coming in, then you have like a switch. The switch uh uh {vocalsound} uh if you p press it then some electrical charge goes into the processor, that thinks over a Morse code, that's how you should see it. The Morse code goes to the amplifier, then uh the signal is sent to two uh light bulbs. You have infrared and an interv um {vocalsound} uh how to say it? Uh a light in indication, light that you know that it's functioning.
Project Manager: Mm-hmm.
Industrial Designer: Uh here again, that's my story about the different modes, if you do want to make remote uh universal, then the processor has to uh make up a different Morse code when some button is pressed. That makes it much more complex, so we really need to have a look, do we want that or not. Uh I don't have any personal p uh preferences uh so far, except for uh the materials to be used uh light, that they are light.
Project Manager: Okay. Okay. That was it?
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} That was it.
Project Manager: I'll get back to my thing then. Uh {disfmarker} Okay, back this up {disfmarker} to the screen. So I got some new information on the project specifications are changing a little. Like you said uh teletext is not not very popular anymore because the uh the internet, nowadays people don't use the teletext anymore or hardly, so it can either {disfmarker} Well, I don't think we should remove the button, because there are always people who are using it.
User Interface: Yeah.
Project Manager: But I don't think it should be {vocalsound} very {disfmarker} it should be one of the big buttons for example. Just put it somewhere or under second option or whatever. It's not important anymore. Um we're targeting young people now, because our um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} This is a new product and with this new product we want to appeal to younger people,
Marketing: Uh.
Project Manager: which are {disfmarker} um the younger people were defined under forty.
Marketing: Yeah.
Project Manager: I so I think it's {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Hmm.
Project Manager: that's also good with the fashion and everything,
Marketing: B
Project Manager: so yeah.
Marketing: Yeah, and they want to pay for it
Project Manager: They want to pay for it, people are willing to spend money actually to buy a um remote that they like.
Marketing: and uh {disfmarker}
Project Manager: If they like the way it looks, the way it functions, so they're actually gonna spend uh spend money on it.
Marketing: With more {disfmarker} Where {disfmarker} with more technical specifications
Project Manager: Yeah.
Marketing: in the {disfmarker}
Project Manager: {gap} {vocalsound} see how far we can go with it anyway, so
Marketing: Yeah.
Project Manager: {disfmarker} And one thing that should be important is that the corporate l colour and slogan are recognisable, which is apparently {vocalsound} black and yellow, but {disfmarker} I'm not sure if we {disfmarker} I think we should keep the the logo in mind, because with colours you can uh have a lot of uh fashionable colours and everything on it, which suits everybody's taste. So {disfmarker} With that concept I started thinking, so why not just steal Nokia's idea and just make changeable covers for your {disfmarker}
User Interface: Oh.
Project Manager: I mean those cost hardly anything I think, and people could even spend extra money on buying a cover
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
Project Manager: and so have an entire new remote control that they like to see. Or we can sh for example we can make a different {vocalsound} {disfmarker} a basic design. And sell the covers separately, for example. That's just a little marketing idea that could be applied, so you can p it appeals to really everyone. So you don't have to {disfmarker} I think you don't have to make entire remote controls. We make a basic one and manufacture this cover separately.
Industrial Designer: Mm-hmm.
Project Manager: So that was that was my idea on what we could do to appeal this product to everyone. So
Industrial Designer: Hmm.
Project Manager: just {disfmarker} I'm not sure if you came up with anything in the meantime, after making a presentation. Would you like to share?
Marketing: Yeah.
Industrial Designer: No, I think this is a good idea.
Project Manager: Okay.
Industrial Designer: But {disfmarker}
Marketing: But {disfmarker} oh?
User Interface: Is it manageable? Is it easy?
Industrial Designer: Go ahead.
Marketing: Yeah, with with an L_C_D_ screen you can {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Oh yeah. I think we should lose the L_C_D_ screen,
Industrial Designer: Y Yes, I think so too.
Project Manager: like you said. I think for example it's it's huge {disfmarker} I think the L_C_D_ is huge,
User Interface: Yeah.
Marketing: Why? Nokia w
Project Manager: it consumes batteries like hell.
Marketing: Uh.
Project Manager: I think it takes up a lot of a lot of power.
User Interface: And it costs too much to fabricate,
Project Manager: It costs a lot, I think.
User Interface: so we're on a tight budget here.
Industrial Designer: Okay, uh {disfmarker}
Project Manager: What we could do, what could be possible, is maybe not an L_C_D_ screen but with a preview,
Marketing: Okay.
Project Manager: but y I'm not sure if it's even possible {vocalsound}. For example, a little T_V_ guide.
Industrial Designer: Mm.
Project Manager: Like you have a little {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Hmm.
Project Manager: just just a text only, not colour, just a little text thing
Industrial Designer: Mm-hmm.
Marketing: Yeah.
Project Manager: so you can use your remote as a T_V_ guide. I'm not sure it's even possible,
Industrial Designer: Hmm. I have to check that out,
Project Manager: but maybe okay, make it {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: I'm not sure.
Project Manager: Yeah, find a little compromise in that, but {disfmarker} What did I write down?
Marketing: Yeah.
Project Manager: I think the p yeah, the beep is a very simple thing to imple implement, just make a button on your T_V_
Industrial Designer: That must be possible.
Project Manager: and just hit the button, it beeps somewhere. I think it's easy to implement,
Industrial Designer: Ja.
Project Manager: we should go for that.
Industrial Designer: I'm sorry,
Project Manager: Uh speech recognition.
User Interface: And it's {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: whe where do you wanna hit the T_ {disfmarker} you wanna {vocalsound} {disfmarker} we want a button on the television. {gap}
Project Manager: I thin {vocalsound} Yeah, I mean where else should you put it?
Industrial Designer: In th okay, but that rules out a universal remote control.
Project Manager: Yeah,
Industrial Designer: Because that's not possible uh.
Project Manager: but {vocalsound} how are you gonna use that if your {disfmarker} I mean if your remote control is lost, how are you gonna press {disfmarker} where are you gonna press the button?
Industrial Designer: Uh. Yeah. Exactly.
User Interface: Maybe just a slap-on sticker with a button which sends out a small signal.
Project Manager: A slap-on sticker. Oh, you mean as like a separate thing you can attach to your T_V_.
Marketing: Mm uh.
Project Manager: Yeah, that could be possible.
User Interface: Yeah, exactly.
Project Manager: A little little box you can attach to your T_V_ is fine then, okay.
Industrial Designer: Okay, then uh I'd I'd like to know now if we want the uh universal remote control or not, because that's uh determines everything I'm gonna do.
Project Manager: I think it's universal. I think we should go for universal,
Industrial Designer: If not {disfmarker}
Project Manager: because apparently we're a separate company making separate c remote controls to sell to a lot of diverse people.
Industrial Designer: Okay.
Project Manager: I think universal remote control should be possible.
Marketing: Yeah. Um {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Okay, then I go for that.
Marketing: Everyone uh wants to buy it, so we w
Project Manager: Yeah, I think we're targeting everyone,
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
Project Manager: so remote {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Okay. No,
Marketing: yeah.
Industrial Designer: it's fine with me, but then I know what to look for.
Project Manager: Okay, universal is good. Speech recognition, I think it's very hard, because we're selling across multiple countries. So I think implementing speech recognition is such a small um apparatus, it's very hard to do.
Marketing: Yeah. Or one.
User Interface: And it's {disfmarker}
Marketing: Or when you say one two uh i it uh it's enough,
Project Manager: Yeah, but I don't see Arabian people speaking one, two uh whatever.
Marketing: right? But {disfmarker} Oh yeah.
User Interface: Besides that, the technology isn't really super yet, so that {vocalsound} is a problem in implementing this.
Project Manager: It's {disfmarker} Yeah.
Marketing: Yeah.
Project Manager: It's not a mature technology, I think it takes a lot of memory and everything in in a remote control,
Marketing: {vocalsound} Okay.
Project Manager: so {disfmarker}
User Interface: It's a good idea, but it's just not {disfmarker} I don't think the market's ripe for that yet.
Project Manager: I don't think it should be implemented in a remote control yet uh.
Industrial Designer: Uh-huh.
Project Manager: What else do we have?
Marketing: Yeah.
Project Manager: Um well you should you should look into the in into the materials that are real durable. So the the the symbols won't fade,
Industrial Designer: Mm-hmm.
Project Manager: maybe a little harder plastic
Industrial Designer: Exactly.
Project Manager: or especially li we don't {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: I already noted that.
Project Manager: maybe we don't have have to do all the buttons, but especially the ones that are um the popular buttons, so those always fade first.
Industrial Designer: Mm, okay. Okay.
Project Manager: Mm the thing is the most important things that we have now.
Industrial Designer: Hmm.
Project Manager: Let's see.
Industrial Designer: If we uh make a remote control with changeable covers, then we can also make uh a cover for every language area.
Project Manager: For example?
Industrial Designer: That's fo {vocalsound} is uh especially for older people, that they can read it read it in their own language.
Project Manager: Well, we're not we're not targeting older people,
Marketing: Yeah.
Project Manager: we should remember that. Everything we target is under forty,
Industrial Designer: That's {disfmarker}
Project Manager: so.
Industrial Designer: okay, okay.
Project Manager: You assume that that they read correctly and I think they're {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Huh.
Project Manager: The most important thing about young people is that they're really sensitive to to trends that are passing through the world,
Marketing: But b
Project Manager: so {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Uh okay.
User Interface: But should the exchangeable covers include the buttons themselves or just the {disfmarker}
Project Manager: No, of course. No, I think it's just something you you put over them, because {disfmarker} Yeah we c Yeah, you ca Well,
Industrial Designer: Hmm.
Project Manager: tha that's not a that's not a bad {disfmarker} that's not even {disfmarker}
User Interface: C
Marketing: But every {disfmarker}
User Interface: that's a problem with the with the text then.
Project Manager: it's not even a bad idea. I mean, for example, if you're if you're into the durability issue you could {disfmarker}
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: Hmm.
Project Manager: For example, if your buttons are faded, after {disfmarker} I mean if you make a durable remote, they are faded, you can just buy a new cover.
Industrial Designer: Mm.
Project Manager: Uh I'm not sure it's it's hard to make.
Industrial Designer: Okay.
Project Manager: So it's a good and a bad idea.
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} Uh but I know that the buttons are like a Nokia telephone on uh one sleeve,
Project Manager: Mm-hmm.
Industrial Designer: so you don't have to change your whole cover. Uh we can make something that you can only remove the sleeve.
User Interface: Oh yeah, I know what you mean.
Industrial Designer: Know what I mean?
Marketing: Oh.
Industrial Designer: It works the same as a Nokia telephone, it's it's in my uh {disfmarker}'kay.
Project Manager: Yeah, I know, it's just just a one one piece of rubber for example,
Marketing: Yeah.
Project Manager: okay. Yeah,
User Interface: Yeah.
Industrial Designer: Exactly.
Project Manager: that's what I {disfmarker} something I have to look into. Either either change both the buttons and and the cover or just the cover, I'm not sure which which is easier,
Industrial Designer: Hmm. {vocalsound}
Project Manager: so {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Um anyway, yeah, this is what we're gonna do afterwards, just lunch break and have more individual work after that, so let's see what we {disfmarker} let's see we {disfmarker} So you have to come up with a components concept, yeah. I want some {disfmarker} you should do some trend-watching, because even if we're if we're gonna do those covers and everything, what people really want, that's what we need to know in this phase,
Marketing: Yeah. Yeah.
Project Manager: because that's gonna be the essential final design that we're gonna come up with.
Marketing: Okay.
Project Manager: {vocalsound} Um {disfmarker} Yeah, I think user interface is fairly obvious. I mean it should be very intuitive,
User Interface: Pretty straightforward.
Project Manager: s Yeah, it should speak for itself. Uh for example I bought a remote control last week with a new T_V_, it was it l it's like all buttons and you have no idea what it does at first,
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: and I'm {gap} total T_V_ new, anyway. So I think it should be {disfmarker} have less or l very little buttons and maybe a second {vocalsound} second level menu for the advanced things. Or maybe just stick'em under a menu, like you said the um {vocalsound} the sound options and the surround and whatever, they're more complicated, just stick'em under one menu and uh give it a {disfmarker} just put it in in s in a software piece, you can menu and you can uh select everything you want to to set on your T_V_.
Industrial Designer: Mm.
User Interface: Is it techni technically possible to uh {vocalsound} send a signal to a television and then pops up a menu,
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
User Interface: because we're working with different types of television, so we're going to work with that?
Project Manager: That is true.
Industrial Designer: I don't think so.
Project Manager: No, that's true.
Industrial Designer: No, I don't think so. Because the television needs to respond to the signal,
Project Manager: Yeah, that's true.
User Interface: It's an in-built menu,
Industrial Designer: and if it doesn't know how, it's {disfmarker}
User Interface: isn't it? Yes.
Industrial Designer: Exactly, that's not possible.
User Interface: So basically
Project Manager: I'm not sure if it's impossible,
User Interface: we {disfmarker}
Project Manager: but uh there's a chance it's not, so.
User Interface: Or we could use a double-sided {disfmarker} for {vocalsound} less used functions
Project Manager: A double-sided remote control?
User Interface: you {disfmarker}
Project Manager: I don't think that's useful.
User Interface: Yeah, with the cover. {vocalsound} I it's basically an idea to overcome these issues,
Project Manager: Yeah, but then you're gonna have a lot of wasted buttons.
User Interface: because {disfmarker}
Project Manager: For example you have a Sony T_V_ and the half of the buttons won't function if you have a {disfmarker} for a Sony that won't {disfmarker} for a Philips T_V_.
Industrial Designer: Hmm.
User Interface: No, but basic functions {disfmarker}
Marketing: Yeah.
User Interface: but functions which are not frequently used.
Project Manager: I don't think we should {disfmarker}
User Interface: Because if we use a universal remote control, we're going to have to have most buttons on it,
Project Manager: Yeah, for exam
User Interface: so {disfmarker}
Project Manager: I'm not s
Marketing: Mm yeah.
Project Manager: yeah, for ex you have to make it a little decision between the part if you want a universal remote control that {disfmarker} it should do what people usually do with their T_V_s, not not the very complicated settings
Industrial Designer: Mm.
Project Manager: that you can usually do that with uh either a old old remote control if they really hate that thing,
Industrial Designer: Mm.
Project Manager: but you can't you cannot take into consideration all the different brands of T_V_s.
Industrial Designer: But that might be broken.
Project Manager: I think there's I think there is a standard for example between uh {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: {gap} Hmm.
Project Manager: because usually the the menu is {disfmarker} the menu button is is usable between different brands. Especially the big ones, the big brands,
Industrial Designer: Hmm. Hmm.
Project Manager: so.'Cause everybody {disfmarker} I have a universal remote control and it can use the menu button, so I think {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Hmm.
Project Manager: I'm not sure, if you can put some research into that, if it's possible. Uh I think just a b
Industrial Designer: Mm okay. {vocalsound}
Project Manager: and the navigation is very basic, it's usually the same thing.
Industrial Designer: Mm. But I think there must be a way uh to invoke the more complicated functions of a television. For instance, if your old remote control is broken and you buy ours, then uh you should be able to get everything out of the television that's in it.
Project Manager: Yeah. Yeah, that's true. I think so
User Interface: Yeah.
Industrial Designer: Because otherwise you'll lose functions by buying our {disfmarker}
Marketing: Yeah. Yeah.
Project Manager: uh we need to put some research into that if if we can open the menu, I think it's possible, just the way how to.
Industrial Designer: Okay, I thi I think so too.
Marketing: Yeah, yeah.
Project Manager: Yeah, then then you could do everything I suppose, because usually the T_V_s have tha that inside in this other little piece of software, so it's okay.
Industrial Designer: And I think that our r remote control should not look like uh any other. For instance uh Sony makes all their remote controls exactly the same for all their devices,
Project Manager: Mm-hmm.
Industrial Designer: and you always grab the wrong one because formatting of the buttons is exactly the same, only the labels are different.
Project Manager: Yeah. Yeah I think it should be a little distinct from everything else,
Industrial Designer: We should not do that.
Project Manager: because it's {disfmarker} either it's both {gap} mayb
Industrial Designer: Exactly.
Marketing: Yeah.
User Interface: Yeah,
Project Manager: maybe the shape can be a little different.
User Interface: I have some ideas. I have some ideas.
Project Manager: Maybe it's a little more curves or whatever.
Industrial Designer: Mm that's your uh division. {vocalsound}
Marketing: Um {disfmarker} yeah. And uh with different colours uh.
Project Manager: So um {disfmarker}
User Interface: I'll put some on paper and present them next time uh the ideas that I have.
Project Manager: Yeah, this {gap}. Not sure what {disfmarker}
Marketing: Okay.
Project Manager: because we have forty minutes, I'm not sure how much time we have left for the meeting anyway, so.
User Interface: I heard a beep go.
Project Manager: Yeah, but it wasn't me, it was him closing something.
Marketing: Yeah.
Project Manager: So anyway, yeah, we could do some i do some work now on on the design for example. I mean what do you want, do you want {gap}, but {disfmarker}
User Interface: Yeah, but we like some some curves or {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Yeah, may maybe something like this. But though smooth inside. So you have the transmitter here for example.
User Interface: Yeah.
Project Manager: Let's see that you {disfmarker} what would be handy. I think that the {vocalsound} the buttons should be {disfmarker} the channel buttons should be {vocalsound} uh on their own.
Marketing: Uh. And a light uh {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Let's see one, two {disfmarker} God damn it.
User Interface: Oh, we get the general ideas, yes.
Project Manager: Yeah, okay. {vocalsound} Another one here. Let's see what {disfmarker} I think this should {disfmarker} these are always on top of the of the control, so they should be here.
Industrial Designer: Hmm.
User Interface: Yeah, and since you're holding it like this, I suggest you put the channel up channel down and volume {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Think it's like this. {vocalsound}
Marketing: Volume.
Project Manager: Withi within the {disfmarker} Yeah, just take it.
User Interface: yeah yeah. So you have the up channel {vocalsound} the down channel {disfmarker} the volume, do we want that horizontal or vertical?
Project Manager: Do you take triangles or {disfmarker}
Marketing: Uh it's it's fine, I think.
Project Manager: Um I think it should be I think it {vocalsound} {disfmarker}
User Interface: This is basically what people are accustomed to,
Project Manager: Maybe we should make'em bigger or whatever.
User Interface: so {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
User Interface: Yeah, but this is just a g general idea.
Marketing: Oh d {gap}
Project Manager: Yeah.
User Interface: Uh maybe the menu button can go i in the middle.
Project Manager: Yeah, in the middle. It's it's usually uh there, but {disfmarker} Mm.
User Interface: Whoa.
Industrial Designer: Perhaps we should also make uh something like a flash on it, if you {disfmarker} if it's lost, for people that are deaf. They they won't hear the the beep.
Marketing: Yeah.
Project Manager: Yeah, but for example if it's lost in your armchair, we'll not see the flash.
User Interface: You won't be able to find it. {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
Project Manager: And flash takes up a lot of batteries again.
Industrial Designer: Uh. Yeah, it's true, but it's it's only has to do so when you press the button that it's lost.
Marketing: Just {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Yeah.
User Interface: We could make a combination that it goes beep and that you {disfmarker} that some light lights up.
Industrial Designer: So. {gap} deaf people?
Marketing: And L_E_D_ uh on it.
Project Manager: Yeah, I thought about for deaf people for example, so. We could do that. Uh let's see.
Marketing: Just a light on it or {disfmarker}
User Interface: So we have the basic channels we've got here, uh the power button somewhere over here?
Project Manager: Oh yeah, it's true. Um that thing should be central.
Marketing: Very important.
Project Manager: You shouldn't be {disfmarker} you uh shouldn't press it by accident, but it shouldn't be stacked away somewhere.
Marketing: Oh,
User Interface: I usually press it on top.
Marketing: that's {disfmarker} It's {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Yeah.
User Interface: At least that's what I'm accustomed to.
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} I have another idea,
Project Manager: Yeah, like that's gonna work. {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: I'm not sure if it's possible.
Marketing: And {disfmarker}
User Interface: What would you like to {gap}?
Project Manager: Yeah, I thought maybe we should move the buttons down
Marketing: But you r
Project Manager: and put it here for example
Marketing: And you are reading from the t
Project Manager: to {disfmarker}
Marketing: you always read from the top to the the bottom of it.
Project Manager: From top to bottom. Yeah, that's true,
Marketing: Yeah,
Project Manager: you should {disfmarker}
Marketing: so it's {disfmarker}
Project Manager: I think the bu the power button should be on top,
Industrial Designer: Mm.
Marketing: Yeah.
Project Manager:'cause it's the first thing you do {vocalsound}, turn it on. So power button on top. Um {disfmarker}
User Interface: Okay, mute button. Is that somewhere here?
Project Manager: Mute. Do we hardly {disfmarker} I think it should be at the bottom somewhere.
User Interface: Is that used often?
Marketing: So i it's {disfmarker}
User Interface: The mute button? Do people use that often?
Marketing: sorry?
Project Manager: Mute. Turn the sound off.
Marketing: No, it's {disfmarker} no. {vocalsound}
User Interface:'Cause uh I'm pretty much accustomed to it {vocalsound} right over here, at least in general,
Marketing: Uh. Hmm.
User Interface: but {disfmarker}
Project Manager: {vocalsound} I don't think it's important, {gap} but I think it I think it should be {disfmarker} you c
User Interface: It's not that important, no.
Project Manager: you could put it somewhere here.
Marketing: Or or with the volume selection. {vocalsound}
Project Manager: No, because it {disfmarker} Yeah, people are accustomed to that,
Marketing: {vocalsound} Around uh not uh not at top at the {disfmarker} around the volume selection.
Project Manager: it's {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Can I have that? That's j
User Interface: Sure.
Marketing: I don't know where exactly,
Project Manager: Take this out and here see {disfmarker}
Marketing: but {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Uh are we gonna take triangles anyway? I'm drawing triangles, but {disfmarker}
Marketing: {vocalsound}
User Interface: That's pretty much what people are accustomed to,
Project Manager: Yeah,
User Interface: aren't they?
Project Manager: it's maybe a bigger lesser than thing. So anyway, I think this is {disfmarker} should be the channels and {disfmarker} or sh
User Interface: Well,
Marketing: Wha
User Interface: I'm accustomed to the channels being on top.
Marketing: No. Yeah.
Project Manager: {vocalsound} Here,
Industrial Designer: Yeah, me too.
Project Manager: okay. Okay,
Marketing: Yeah, that's better.
Project Manager: should we chan
Marketing: On the right.
Project Manager: okay, {vocalsound} this two, channel up and down.
Industrial Designer: Shall we uh also look if it's possible to make a rechargeable remote? That you don't have to buy new batteries if every {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Well,
Marketing: Yeah.
Project Manager: for {disfmarker} that is it's on one part it's um it's a good thing to recharge it {disfmarker}
Marketing: Maybe it's more ex expensive.
Industrial Designer: Mm, yeah.
Project Manager: Maybe we should {disfmarker} what what could be possible is one with rechargeable batteries for example.
Industrial Designer: Uh.
Project Manager: You have {disfmarker} just put Penlite batteries that are rechargeable, because it's an it's it's it's very annoying.
User Interface: But isn't that expensive in the entire package?
Industrial Designer: But that's already possible.
Marketing: Yeah.
Project Manager: I'm not sure y {vocalsound} I'm not sure it's {disfmarker} if it's expensive, but just take a look at it, because it might be a very good idea. Because if {disfmarker} it's it's uh useful to have it rechargeable,
User Interface: {gap}
Project Manager: but at the same time, if you don't want recha if you forgot to recharge it and you wanna watch T_V_ now, you wanna be able to put different batteries in it, use it now and not in half an hour.
Industrial Designer: Yes. Yes. Okay. Uh you could make a device, but I'm not sure how that uh is possible with the costs, that you can put in normal batteries, rechargeable,
Project Manager: I think I have a nice idea.
Industrial Designer: but it {disfmarker} you're {disfmarker} the remote also can act as a recharger. So then you can choose, you have every decision. Know what I mean?
Project Manager: Not exactly uh.
Industrial Designer: You can uh put in normal Penlites, rechargeable Penlites, but they can also be recharged with the remote, with a wire.
Marketing: Hmm. Yeah yeah.
Project Manager: I think it's uh it's a pretty good idea to have uh like sort of a {disfmarker} maybe a base station that you put on the T_V_. Could be flat, you could insert your uh remote into it.
Industrial Designer: So {disfmarker} but {disfmarker}
Marketing: Yeah, that's g
Industrial Designer: But I think that will cost a lot.
Project Manager: I'm not sure.
Industrial Designer: Uh a normal wire would be better.
Project Manager: A what?
Industrial Designer: Like a like a P_D_A_, a hand-held. You can uh just put it in the electricity and it charges itself,
Project Manager: Well, we were talking about the fact that we wanted to insert either a beep or a flash into the thing with a little separate signal
Industrial Designer: you don't need basic station. Yes.
Project Manager: or {disfmarker} So you could put that on a T_V_ for example.
Industrial Designer: That is possible, that's true.
Project Manager: It could be very flat, could be very small.
Marketing: But {disfmarker} Which {disfmarker}
Project Manager: It's a very small {disfmarker} Yeah, I'm drawing it big now, but {disfmarker} So you can put your remote on flat for example.
Industrial Designer: Mm.
Project Manager: And at the backside of remote just just just a little hole
Marketing: Yeah.
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
Project Manager: for example um you just {vocalsound} put it down, it recharges for example.
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
Project Manager: I don't think it's very expensive.
User Interface: But again, isn't that too expensive?
Marketing: Yeah.
User Interface:'Cause that means that we have to implement rechargeable batteries, a docking station {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: I'm not sure if it costs a lot, that that's what he r
Industrial Designer: Mm.
Project Manager: That's that you {disfmarker} that's what you buy yourself.
Industrial Designer: Yes. I'm going to try to find that out. I'm not sure if there's information available on this,
Project Manager: It's just an idea, we have to find out if it's possible.
Industrial Designer: but {disfmarker}
Marketing: But {disfmarker}
User Interface: And do people actually want that? To pay extra {disfmarker} they want to pay for rechargeable?
Marketing: Yeah, they want to pay for it.
Project Manager: Do they want {disfmarker} but they want a rechargeable one?
Marketing: Yeah.
Project Manager: I'm not sure, you should find out if it's {disfmarker} if rechargeable is important.
Marketing: Th uh there was not a el ask esque {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Yeah.
Industrial Designer: Hmm. These are uh comfort issues. So I think people will pay {disfmarker} they wanted to pay for comfort.
Marketing: But {disfmarker}
Project Manager: They want to pay for comfort,
Industrial Designer: Well, this is comfort.
Project Manager: we just assu we we could either make a separate station which just sends a signal to the remote control to either beep or flash to find it,
Marketing: But f hmm.
Industrial Designer: Yes.
Project Manager: um and {disfmarker} Yeah, we have to {disfmarker} either that or make it integrated with a with a docking station.
Industrial Designer: Hmm. Yeah. Exactly. I think this is a brilliant product.
Project Manager: {vocalsound} I think it would be good actually.
Industrial Designer: I would buy it myself.
Project Manager: I like the beep part {vocalsound} anyway.
Industrial Designer: Uh.
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: So um
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: let's go through the {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: I like the covers. That's a brilliant idea.
Marketing: {vocalsound}
User Interface: Can can we save this or {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Covers is covers is good.
Industrial Designer: I never thought {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Yeah, it's {disfmarker} Oh we can save this. Up and saved. We even saved the ant. {gap} Um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Okay. So
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: what we have is {disfmarker} you have {disfmarker} I think you have {vocalsound} to do a lot of work on if it's possible for the cost.
Industrial Designer: I hope if I have information about that,
Project Manager: Maybe {disfmarker} yeah,
Industrial Designer: I'm gonna {disfmarker}
Project Manager: or {vocalsound} maybe you can find out i what people are willing to pay.
User Interface: Yeah.
Marketing: Yeah.
Project Manager: We are going for twenty five Euros sales price,
Industrial Designer: {gap}
Marketing: Yeah, okay.
Project Manager: but just try to find out what they're willing to pay for it, because if they're willing to pay more, we could lose a little profit and maybe attract more customers,
Marketing: Yeah yeah yeah.
Industrial Designer: Mm. {vocalsound} Yeah.
Project Manager: uh we just have to see what it looks like.
Marketing: Yeah.
Industrial Designer: I would like to make a decision {gap}. What it costs and what kind of materials that we can uh choose what we want in it
Project Manager: {vocalsound} Yeah, if you have some financial information that that'd be nice,
Industrial Designer: and {disfmarker} exactly, I need it.
Project Manager: so. Hmm. {vocalsound}
User Interface: Could you post some {vocalsound} other essentials of what people want, so that I can work with some buttons, where to put it {disfmarker}
Project Manager: {vocalsound} {vocalsound}
Marketing: Yeah.
User Interface: You seem to have information on that, I'd like to uh see some of it.
Industrial Designer: Was it not possible to uh send emails around the office?
Project Manager: No, it wasn't wasn't allo
User Interface: No, it's not. No.
Project Manager: it was possible,
Industrial Designer: Not {gap}.
Project Manager: not allowed, so. So that's um why I'm not sure that {vocalsound} you're allowed to share documents on the on the draft.
Marketing: Yeah. My computer crashed,
Industrial Designer: Yeah, okay.
Marketing: so uh
Project Manager: I don't care. I haven't heard any complaints yet,
User Interface: Oh, your computer. Okay.
Marketing: I lost my uh presentation,
Project Manager: so. Um {disfmarker}
Marketing: but I have the uh {vocalsound} {disfmarker}
User Interface: Well, I have your PowerPoint presentation, I can get some inf information out of that.
Marketing: Yeah, but I Here I have the the s the homepage of uh our internet,
User Interface: Let's see.
Project Manager: Yeah, the oh, they inc uh
Marketing: and here is my
Project Manager: they include the new one. {vocalsound} Or just for you.
User Interface: Oh, where would we {disfmarker}
Marketing: here is my marketing report,
Project Manager: {vocalsound} Oh
Marketing: maybe you ca you can look at uh {vocalsound} that
Project Manager: no, I didn't have that.
Marketing: and {disfmarker}
User Interface: Where would we want the uh teletext button?
Marketing: Ah yeah.
User Interface: Because we decided that it's n not that important.
Project Manager: All it tells {gap} just {disfmarker} let's make make a new {disfmarker}
Marketing: And one {disfmarker}
User Interface: Do we put it somewhere over here?
Project Manager: tick the new one. {vocalsound} Um other side. Yeah, let's increase it a little because {disfmarker}
Marketing: And uh wha what people want, I've uh
User Interface: Or maybe this is something for the next meeting, I can draw out some ideas.
Project Manager: Yeah, draw us up some some designs of of possible {disfmarker}
Marketing: I have another thing uh {disfmarker}
Project Manager: just keep in mind that the important buttons should be on top and either big,
User Interface: Yeah.
Project Manager: so the more {disfmarker} less important {disfmarker}
User Interface: Well, we have decided {vocalsound} more or less the basic structure.
Project Manager: More or less.
User Interface: I can put the other buttons in {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Just play a little with this, put l shift a little up or down and we'll see what looks best.
User Interface: Yeah.
Industrial Designer: What uh what did you wanna say?
Project Manager: Or just po post your designs from time to time on the product share.
Marketing: Yeah. Um {disfmarker}
User Interface: Yeah.
Marketing: {vocalsound} Uh what I al already said is the the uh the remote controls are always lost,
User Interface: Maybe another idea uh.
Marketing: but it it's also for people, {vocalsound} they want to learn it fast,
Industrial Designer: Mm. Mm.
Marketing: not uh {disfmarker} they want to {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Yeah, so we don't want {gap} we want very little buttons, just the buttons you use a lot.
Marketing: No
Industrial Designer: Mm.
Marketing: It's {disfmarker} yeah, it's easy to learn
User Interface: Yes, but it should cover all the functions,
Marketing: wi and uh {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Well
User Interface: so possibly, just an idea that popped in {disfmarker}
Project Manager: what {disfmarker} we had function that what people do,
Marketing: Um {disfmarker}
Project Manager: so. People change channels, people {vocalsound} {disfmarker} they change the volume and they they change channel, they turn T_V_ off and on, for example. That's the basic fu that's what you do {disfmarker} I'm not sure who present that again, but those are the basic function that people use it for, so those should be very well represented.
User Interface: Yeah, but we could go a step further,
Marketing: And {disfmarker} The {disfmarker} If {disfmarker}
User Interface: because some T_V_s have the uh possibility to adjust brightness, that kind of menus.
Project Manager: That's true, but that's what we stick under the menu button. Everything is {disfmarker} you say in every T_V_ that's configured under the menu.
User Interface: Yes, but it {disfmarker} Because we're making {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: But that's the question, is it?
Marketing: Um {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Because it needs to be configured in the television under the menu.
Project Manager: Yeah, but {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: If it isn't, then we cannot reach it.
User Interface: We need to adjust to the {vocalsound} technology.
Project Manager: But I think most modern T_V_s have it in their menu.
Industrial Designer: I think so too. I think so too.
User Interface: True.
Industrial Designer: Uh isn't there a possibility to do research on that, so we know that for sure? If you rule out functions, then uh {disfmarker} and that gets known, then people are not gonna buy it.
Marketing: {gap}
User Interface: {vocalsound} No, I thi
Industrial Designer: Then the consumer bond or something says uh you cannot do this and that with it. That's a bad bad com {vocalsound} commercial
Marketing: If um {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Uh we'll we'll see what we can come up with.
Industrial Designer: for {vocalsound} {disfmarker} okay.
Marketing: Another thing I want to say is that uh we are looking at the market for the age uh {vocalsound} younger than forty.
Project Manager: Under forty. Yeah?
Industrial Designer: That's true.
Marketing: Um on my report, {vocalsound} I didn't uh {vocalsound} ish I didn't show it in my uh presentation,
Project Manager: Mm-hmm.
Marketing: because my computer crashed.
Project Manager: Yeah yeah.
Marketing: Um they want to pay for an L_C_D_ screen and speech recognition.
Industrial Designer: Hmm. Hmm.
Project Manager: The want to pay for {disfmarker}
Marketing: So
Project Manager: Oh.
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} Did they really said it like that? Those two things.
Marketing: i yeah. Yeah,
Project Manager: Uh shall we?
Industrial Designer: Do they realise how much that costs? {vocalsound}
Marketing: and {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: That's almost undoable.
Marketing: Yeah.
Project Manager: Younger, age sixteen and forty five.
User Interface: Oh, we're not going to be able to sell it for twenty-five then, with an L_C_D_ screen.
Marketing: {vocalsound} Uh but {disfmarker}
Project Manager: That's all here, here it says {vocalsound} {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} No, that's that's {gap}. Even if i if we have this lost unit, then we cannot do it for that price.
Project Manager: Yeah, age sixteen forty fi interest in main features more critical.
Marketing: If if they {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Okay, so we're not focusing on this. Um {disfmarker} All the interest in features, not really the L_C_ {disfmarker} oh here. Would you pay for uh speech recognition in a remote control. Hmm, okay?
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} Yeah, that's true.
Marketing: So uh
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Marketing: we can
Project Manager: Speech recognition is quite {disfmarker}
Marketing: We can look at the possibilities for an uh L_C_D_ and uh {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Yeah, just look at the possibilities then,
Marketing: I dunno.
Project Manager: because if {disfmarker}
Marketing: Yeah.
Project Manager: apparently it's what people want,
Industrial Designer: Hmm.
Project Manager: it's supposed to be a luxurious remote,
Marketing: How much it will cost
Industrial Designer: Uh.
Marketing: and {disfmarker}
Project Manager: maybe it's not even that expensive. Or find a compromise, maybe just a black and white or {disfmarker} for some extra information on it, on your programmes.
Industrial Designer: Uh I {disfmarker}
User Interface: Well
Marketing: Um {disfmarker}
User Interface: I doubt it, but {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: But I really need finance information.
Project Manager: Me too. {vocalsound} I mean we all do. {vocalsound}
Marketing: {vocalsound} It will come uh {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: We all do. {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Right. I think it's something we should put into consideration. Apparently it's what people want, so. We should see if {disfmarker} what it costs, if it's possible.
Industrial Designer: Mm. Uh.
Marketing: Yeah.
Project Manager: Yeah. {vocalsound} Yeah, we should do a little thing about design, because it looks boring really to me. Even if you put it {disfmarker} even if you put a different cover on it, it looks {disfmarker} still looks boring,
Marketing: {vocalsound} Different colours maybe.
Project Manager: so.
Industrial Designer: Hmm. And the design, it should differ.
Marketing: But all {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: This is Philips, huh?
Project Manager: I have no clue.
Industrial Designer: Philips has this.
Project Manager: I just drew something what {disfmarker} which would fit into your hand easily.
User Interface: Well, I had basically {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Okay. Hmm. Uh.
User Interface: Something like this. To make it kind of futuristic.
Industrial Designer: Mm. Oh, I realise if we make it small, then it needs to be a little thicker,
Project Manager: I think it's a very {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: because I need to put all the electronics in it.
Project Manager: Sorry?
Industrial Designer: If we make it s uh smaller, uh less wide, then we need to m make it a little thicker,
Project Manager: Yeah?
Industrial Designer: because I have to put all the electronics in it.
Project Manager: Okay. Mm-hmm. Yeah, but you have to j just keep in mind it shouldn't be too heavy.
Marketing: Okay.
Project Manager: I mean we can stick it in in there, I think.
Industrial Designer: No.
Project Manager: Huh even if {disfmarker}
User Interface: So
Project Manager: in the worst case we can even {disfmarker}
User Interface: what kind of {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Could you give me the pen back?
User Interface: Yeah, sure.
Project Manager: So let's say that people would want an L_C_D_ thing. Let's take take the basic design again, what we {disfmarker} oh, crap {disfmarker} uh came up with. I'll just make it a little bigger now. So a transmitter here. Anyway. We could {disfmarker} let's say we have an L_C_D_ screen, people want an L_C_D_ screen. So then we should probably put it here.
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: It doesn't have to be really big, but just just have to be {disfmarker} has to be there.
Industrial Designer: Hmm.
Project Manager: Think it's a good place, people don't {disfmarker}
Marketing: If you're reading from top to bottom, I think it's better to put it uh at the top.
Project Manager: No? It's not that uh {disfmarker} it's not the most important function,
Industrial Designer: Me too.
Marketing: It's j {vocalsound}
Project Manager: it's just an extra thing,
Industrial Designer: Ah
Project Manager: it just {disfmarker} you press the buttons on top,
Marketing: {vocalsound} Uh. But i if you if you are going to uh put the L_C_D_ on it, {vocalsound} I think it's very important to use it,
Industrial Designer: but {gap}.
Project Manager: because your finger is on top.
Marketing: uh because it's {vocalsound} {disfmarker} use it uh
Project Manager: How can you use an L_C_D_ screen?
Marketing: But nee the function of it. {vocalsound} So you can use it maximum, because uh it's a lot {disfmarker} it costs a lot.
Project Manager: Yeah, but why
Marketing: So {disfmarker}
Project Manager: I {disfmarker} I'm not sure.
User Interface: Now it's pretty much tucked away in your hand.
Project Manager: Uh if you t if you press a button, you can see it,
Industrial Designer: Hmm. No.
Project Manager: ri I'm not sure wha I'm trying to imagine myself what it would look like.
User Interface: I'm {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: M I personally would prefer it on the top.
Project Manager: You would prefer it n Okay.
Marketing: Yeah.
Project Manager: So we have three people saying it should be on top.
Industrial Designer: Huh.
Project Manager: Okay, but then you would would s have to stack away your buttons somewhere else.
Industrial Designer: But it {disfmarker} Hmm.
Project Manager: Anyways.
Marketing: It's expensive to build it,
Industrial Designer: Mm.
Marketing: so
Project Manager: Uh this looks a little {disfmarker}
User Interface: I'm still not convinced of the {disfmarker}
Marketing: you must use the maximum of it.
Project Manager: About the L_C_D_s thing.
User Interface: Yeah.
Project Manager: Well if it if it's
Industrial Designer: Hmm.
Project Manager: if it's possible wi if it's not too expensive, we should include it,
Industrial Designer: They want it uh.
Project Manager: because it's it's cool. {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} We should just try to make that if it's possible. If it is possible we should really do it, but we need that information.
Marketing: Huh. Uh. But uh {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Also keep in mind again, the L_C_D_ screen is very flat, but it needs transistors, resistors, I don't know what more and that needs space. So I have to look if that's possible.
Marketing: Yeah, I know uh.
User Interface: So basically
Industrial Designer: But if we {disfmarker}
User Interface: {disfmarker} can I {disfmarker}
Project Manager: {vocalsound} Uh we have green now uh {disfmarker}
User Interface: what we have to decide now is uh what goes on top. Do we put the volume control and the channel control here, or do we put it on he Would we like to press it in the middle?
Project Manager: Or maybe we should m we could uh draw draw something a bit {disfmarker} that has it on on on the bottom.
Marketing: In middle of it. In the middle.
Project Manager: Maybe in a circle for example, like we {disfmarker} like in this example. I think this is not good, but for {disfmarker} we could make circular buttons for example. For up and down, ma make it a circle on it,
Industrial Designer: Hmm.
User Interface: Yes, but we do agree that we {vocalsound} keep this at the centre,
Project Manager: because it {disfmarker}
Marketing: {vocalsound} Yeah.
User Interface: because it's basically the most important function.
Project Manager: I think the channel button should be in the centre.
Marketing: It's the most import yeah.
Project Manager: Channel button should be st stick together, for example here in this section. Because it's uh {disfmarker}
User Interface: Well, that would make them quite small.
Project Manager: We're not sure about the size anyway,
User Interface: So maybe you'd put them here.
Project Manager: just a general design. You can make it as big as you want. For example if you take uh {disfmarker}
User Interface: Yes, but a big remote control probably not something which people would like.
Project Manager: No,
Industrial Designer: Hmm.
Project Manager: let's see. For example just {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: If we have a a space issue, we can also lose one battery. It is rechargeable, so we can stick with one instead of two.
Project Manager: Yeah.
Marketing: {gap}.
Project Manager: I don't think if we if we even use an L_C_D_ screen, we need to, definitely.
Industrial Designer: That might be an option. Yeah, but if we need two batteries and an L_C_D_ screen, that means a lot of space that we need.
Project Manager: Yeah, but we have to see what the si what the size is.
Industrial Designer: But it has to be a little bit heavier.
Project Manager: The L_C_D_ doesn't have to nee doesn't need to be very big.
Industrial Designer: Okay.
Marketing: {gap} {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: No, but the things behind it. {gap} space.
Project Manager: Mm let's see.
Industrial Designer: Like a process uh.
Marketing: Finish meeting now.
Project Manager: Finish meeting now.
Marketing: It's on your computer.
Project Manager: Okay, we will. So either {disfmarker}
User Interface: So would we like this or would we like the {disfmarker}
Project Manager: We either we have to decide what what people want.
Industrial Designer: I like this one more.
Project Manager: Either this one, this this could be the luxurious one. So we have channel buttons here. I'm just drawing something uh. Uh {disfmarker} I think this would this would look cool. You could have it for example {disfmarker} small buttons here for some extra functions,
Marketing: Uh.
Project Manager: so if your basic function's here, we should {disfmarker} like we decided before, programmes up and down, and volume here.
User Interface: Let's see what we have here.
Industrial Designer: Mm.
Marketing: Or {disfmarker} And uh what about speech recognition uh {disfmarker}
Project Manager: {vocalsound} Well you can just {disfmarker} no, I'm not sure if we can do that,
Marketing: Yeah, yeah,
Project Manager: but we could put a microphone in here for example.
Marketing: but {disfmarker} or or an L_C_D_ or an uh speech.
Industrial Designer: Mm.
Marketing: I think it's {disfmarker} L_C_D_ is better now.
Project Manager: Just to do research into both, w what it costs and what it takes for space.
Marketing: Yeah.
Industrial Designer: I'll try to.
Project Manager: But let's cut the meeting for now yes.
Marketing: Yeah.
Industrial Designer: One more uh thing I'd like to say, uh let's give this uh a name, and not like some vague serial number that no one understands, like with cars.
User Interface: Okay.
Marketing: Yeah, okay, yeah,
Industrial Designer: Shall we all try uh to think about a name?
User Interface: So I think of a name.
Marketing: that's {vocalsound} {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Yeah, let's think of a name, okay.
Marketing: yeah, that's okay.
Project Manager: Uh okay.
Marketing: Oh, good.
Project Manager: Okay, at anyways, the the minutes will be on the on the web shortly,
User Interface: So {disfmarker}
Project Manager: so there we go uh.
User Interface: Yes, go and finish up and I'll see you at lunch.
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
Marketing: Yeah.
Industrial Designer: Good luck.
Project Manager: Yeah, to all.
User Interface: Yeah.
Marketing: Same.
Project Manager: {gap}
Industrial Designer: Yeah, I've {disfmarker} Do we uh save the {gap}?
Project Manager: {gap}
Marketing: {gap}. {gap}.","First Industrial Designer raised questions like whether their remote control would be universal and should it be programmable or not, because they needed something like a mode to send out a different signal so that the remote can work in this way. Then the size of the remote was also put by Industrial Designer since there were already plenty of technical parts in it and it was quite complex to deal with material problems. But at last Industrial Designer came up with the idea of integration of materials and in this way, the new product would cost less.",qmsum
"Summarize the whole meeting.
Project Manager: Okay. Here we go. Alright, the agenda for thi oh. Alright. Um the agenda for this meeting {vocalsound} is um {disfmarker} we'll initially have the prototype presentation by our two designers. And then we will evaluate it, given the criteria that um that we gave gave it. And um talk about our finances, whether we were under or over our budget. I have a um a spreadsheet where we can calculate um our prices for every aspect of of what we've made, given our options. And um evaluate the product, as a group.
Industrial Designer: Okay.
Project Manager: And um {disfmarker} So first we'll have the prototype presentation. Do you need the um PowerPoint for this?
Industrial Designer: Um yeah. I just got a few slides, so show them.
Project Manager: Alright.
Industrial Designer: Thank you. Do you want to present it? {vocalsound}
User Interface: {vocalsound} Um {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Yeah, here we are.
User Interface: {vocalsound} This is what we came up with. It's a pretty simple design. It's um based on a mango? Yeah. And {vocalsound} we {disfmarker}
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: On?
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} Mango shape.
Project Manager: {vocalsound} A mango. Okay.
User Interface: Yeah. And we have the company logo here and this will be the infrared here
Industrial Designer: The L_E_D_.
User Interface: and this'll be the power point, the on off button kind {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Oh. Okay.
User Interface: yeah.
Marketing: I'm sorry.
Project Manager: Oops.
Marketing: What was the {disfmarker} where's the L_E_D_?
User Interface: It's in the middle of one of the little R_s.
Marketing: Oh. Okay.
User Interface: And then the other one is the power. And uh we just have a simple design. We wanted it all to be
Industrial Designer: So it's palm-held.
User Interface: accessible from your thumb
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
User Interface: {disfmarker} yeah palm-held
Project Manager: Yeah.
User Interface: and all the buttons are accessible from your thumb.
Project Manager: Notice you have a number ten button.
User Interface: So you don't have to {disfmarker} Oh that was a mistake, wasn't it?
Project Manager: {vocalsound} Okay. {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: You just need the nought. {vocalsound}
User Interface: Right no, that's a zero.
Marketing: {vocalsound}
User Interface: {vocalsound} Take that one off. {vocalsound} Sorry. I was in charge of the numbers. {vocalsound}
Project Manager: {vocalsound} No problem.
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: {vocalsound} Ah.
User Interface: And this is just if you've got like eleven or twelve or thirt the plus.
Industrial Designer: So one plus one would be eleven,
User Interface: {vocalsound} You can go one, three or something.
Industrial Designer: or {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Oh. You press a plus button?
User Interface: You press that first and then you go one three yeah.
Project Manager: Oh okay. I've never heard of that kind before.
User Interface: Well we just thought, we have all the numbers here, so we wanted something representative of numbers larger than ten and {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Yeah.
Industrial Designer: Yeah because if you {disfmarker} on your average um remote, if you press one twice you just go to {disfmarker} um or uh say you wanted channel twelve, you press one, and then you go to channel one, and then two then you'd just go to channel two, instead of twelve.
Project Manager: Yeah.
Marketing: Oh, there's no e
Project Manager: Oh.
Industrial Designer: So if you did like one plus two you could go to channel twelve, or two plus two is channel twenty two.
User Interface: So the plus and then {disfmarker}
Marketing: okay.
User Interface: yeah.
Project Manager: I
Marketing: Okay.
Project Manager: But {disfmarker} Would you have to go zero plus one if you wanted to go to channel one or two?
User Interface: No no, th all {disfmarker} that's why we have all these numbers. These numbers um these numbers all work independently up to nine. {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Yeah but I mean if you press, it'll go to that channel right away.'Cause you gotta press the plus afterwards.
User Interface: Yeah. Oh no. Uh, the plus is only for if you're going past the number nine.
Project Manager: Yeah I know, but if if I wanna go to say number like sixty five, channel sixty five, if I press the six it'll go to channel six, and then I'll press the plus, and then it'll go to six and then put the five and it'll go to sixty five?
Marketing: Sixty.
User Interface: You p Oh. No you press the plus first.
Industrial Designer: Oh.
User Interface: I I {disfmarker} well it doesn't {disfmarker} we haven't really s I would've thought you pressed the plus first and then the six five,
Marketing: {vocalsound}
User Interface: but she says plus {disfmarker} {vocalsound} press {disfmarker} which {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Well I don't mind, we can further define that.
User Interface: what do you think is simpler?
Project Manager: I th Um {disfmarker}
User Interface: It's a {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: I wouldn't have thought it'd be a problem that it went to channel six first, in like on the way to channel sixty five.
User Interface: Yeah.
Project Manager: Yeah it wouldn't be a problem. But I was just wondering
Industrial Designer: But I suppose it's not as snappy.
User Interface: Yeah.
Project Manager: like as long as we realise that's what it'll do.
Marketing: Well the there is a {disfmarker} there's a delay on remotes I think.
User Interface: Oops. Yeah.
Marketing: Where you can have it {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
Marketing: it's like a five second input time.
Industrial Designer: Yeah. If you don't put it {disfmarker}
Marketing: So as long as you hit them dada
Industrial Designer: Yeah. Yeah,
User Interface: Yeah.
Industrial Designer: that {disfmarker} yeah.
Marketing: {vocalsound} it should be fine.
Project Manager: Yeah.
Marketing: As long as there's not a big pause between the t hitting the two buttons.
Industrial Designer: Mm-hmm.
User Interface: Yeah. So {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Um {disfmarker}
Marketing: Was there {disfmarker} so on the top there is volume and {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: And channel,
User Interface: A channel.
Industrial Designer: which is so you could just go like that without thinking about it, like {disfmarker}
Marketing: Channel up volume up. Okay cool.
Project Manager: C_ and V_.
User Interface: Just so we can flick {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Right, where um where's the power button?
Marketing: Yeah.
User Interface: It's in the middle of one of the little R_s. {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: It's the bigger R_.
Marketing: It's the R_.
Project Manager: Oh okay.
Industrial Designer: So it's just like {vocalsound}.
User Interface: Yeah,
Project Manager: Yeah.
User Interface: so it's all accessible. Without m taking your hand off the remote.
Industrial Designer: We deci
Project Manager: Yeah.
Industrial Designer: Yeah um we went for like a a circular design for the numbers
Marketing: Mm-hmm.
Industrial Designer: because we thought that's kind of a more natural movement than just going like that with your thumb.
Project Manager: Oh okay.
Industrial Designer: Uh e ergonomics are all considered.
Project Manager: Yeah.
Marketing: Mm-hmm.
Project Manager: Ergonomic, definitely ergonomic.
User Interface: And {vocalsound} it might actually help with the repetitive stress injury as well.
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: It could cause another type of repetitive stress injury though.
User Interface: Okay. {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: But yeah, no I mean it's a different movement
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: so {disfmarker} yeah.
User Interface: Yeah.
Industrial Designer: Um and the feel of it, I mean, we've made this out of Play Doh, which is representing the, you know, the rubber, and the spongy rubberness.
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: The spon yeah.
User Interface: Yeah. {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: Um'cause it was said before in the material specification that this {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} this anti-R_S_I_ um material is often used in stress balls so this has got a you know a bit of give to it,
Project Manager: Yeah.
Industrial Designer: and it just feels feels different.
User Interface: Yeah.
Project Manager: Bit of a stress ball feel.
Industrial Designer: Would you like to feel it yourselves?
User Interface: Yeah. {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Yes. I would.
Industrial Designer: How it fits in the palm of your hand?
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: My goodness.
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} Thanks.
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: {vocalsound} There you go.
Industrial Designer: And you? {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Genevieve?
Marketing: Yes
Project Manager: Yeah. {vocalsound}
Marketing: . Oh it's nice. Oh I think I killed the five.
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Marketing: I did.
Project Manager: And something hmm. {vocalsound}
Marketing: I killed the four. Oh god. {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: O Okay, as for the colours, we were presented with um a limited range of colours for this prototype.
User Interface: Of Play Doh yeah.
Marketing: Oh it smells good. {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: But we're thinking that, seeing as we're having it in interchangeable casing anyway, that this is not necessarily a representation of the true colours that we would necessarily use. Or the combination. Um and we're thinking to carry-on with the fruit and vegetable theme, the colour um combination just could just be named after different fruit, like banana could be black and yellow, watermelon red and green,
Project Manager: Oh right.
Industrial Designer: or vanilla might be the most popular if it just uh blends in
User Interface:'Cause it'd be quite subtle and {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: more settled cream instead of the others are all a bit garish.
Project Manager: Yeah. It looks more {disfmarker} Think like vanilla and banana would.
Industrial Designer: Banana's more representative of our colour scheme, like the company {disfmarker} the yellow and black.
Project Manager: Okay yeah.
User Interface: Yeah.
Industrial Designer: So that {disfmarker} for corporate identity that would probably be the most strength.
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: I mean watermelon, you know, m probably appealing to the {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Kinda Christmas, you know.
Industrial Designer: yeah, seasonal.
User Interface: Yeah, yeah, yeah. {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: Apple green, brown, more kinda trendy, you know, khaki {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Yeah.
User Interface: The pomegranate's kinda girly and funky kind of,
Project Manager: Cool.
User Interface: and then the vanilla's more for the more sophisticated {vocalsound} customer who just wants something that fits in with all decor.
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: Yeah. Okay. Um yeah we thought of the components it was definitely um a focus of ergonomics and just a single ha handheld device, I mean you don't need to use both hands, one hand to hold this and type in with the other, you can just use your thumb.
User Interface: Yeah.
Industrial Designer: Um, as we said the rubber's probably used for comfort and anti-R_S_I_ and that's about it.
Project Manager: Alright, thank you very much.
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Good work everyone.
Marketing: {vocalsound} Bravo {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Alright. And so now that we've we have a prototype, uh we need to go over the finances and seeing if this prototype matches uh what our budget can handle.
Industrial Designer: Mm-hmm.
Project Manager: So, I have something I'm going to {disfmarker} Oh wait a minute.
Marketing: You want the {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Do you need to do a presentation first?
Marketing: {vocalsound} I don't know what order it goes in.
Project Manager: Yeah. I'm gonna check that out for a second.
Marketing: I have one.
Industrial Designer: Mm go {disfmarker}
Project Manager: What time is it anyw
Industrial Designer: {gap}
Project Manager: Oh yeah sorry you're right. Evaluation criteria is next in line.
Marketing: Evaluation cri Okay. That's me.
Project Manager: Yeah.
Marketing: Hello. Oh there we go. Okay. Come on my computer. Come on. {vocalsound} Sorry my computer's giving me technical difficulties.
Project Manager: Just press um function eight again.
Marketing: Should I press it again? Last time I did that it sh Okay. You're right.
Project Manager: And then again I think. One more time.
Marketing: Oh. Still not there.
Project Manager: Yeah. Yeah.
Marketing: Okay now I think for this one I could {disfmarker} Would you guys prefer use the whiteboard or mayb maybe I'll just do it on {disfmarker} right on the screen where you can see it. Um, we're gonna be doing an evaluation report together based on the protoptype that we've just seen. Um and looking looking back at my notes from our {disfmarker} both our conceptual and our functional meetings, um I made a list of what our original requirements and goals were, um, back to our kick-off meeting this morning. Um, and we'll evaluate as to whether we've s done what we set out to do. Um and we're gonna do it on a one to seven scale where one is true and seven is false. So basically the lower p the lower the points the better. {vocalsound} Okay so question number one. Does the remote {disfmarker} whoops. Sorry. Oh I'm not gonna be able {disfmarker} um, I'll do it on the whiteboard. I can't change it so I'm g I'm gonna ask you to push it down once.
Project Manager: Okay.
Marketing: I'll write down our scores up on the {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Ooh.
Marketing: Okay so number one. Do we have a fancy look-and-feel?
Industrial Designer: Feel I think.
User Interface: Mm.
Industrial Designer: We've been quite successful with the rubber coating
Project Manager: Yeah.
Industrial Designer: and {disfmarker}
Project Manager: The look is a little bit more playful.
User Interface: Well {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
User Interface: Yeah.
Marketing: Yeah I guess that depends on your definition of fancy, but it's definitely different.
Project Manager: Oh definitely different yeah.
Marketing: It's not your traditional {disfmarker} yeah.
Industrial Designer: I think the colour has a lot to do with it. I mean {vocalsound} th the colours we were given for making the prototype aren't the colours that I think we would've necessarily chosen.
Marketing: Mm-hmm.
User Interface: Yeah.
Industrial Designer: It's not the kind of {disfmarker} ooh uh at all sleek
Project Manager: Oh you were only given red and black?
Industrial Designer: {disfmarker} red, black and yellow, and orange.
Project Manager: Oh okay.
User Interface: Yeah {vocalsound} so {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} Um {disfmarker}
User Interface: {vocalsound} not very sleek and we don't wanna go for black because most remote controls are black or grey.
Marketing: Yeah.
User Interface: So we want it to be stand out that way, anyway.
Project Manager: Yeah. Okay.
Industrial Designer: But if you can imagine that in like a s just a {disfmarker} maybe uh a kind of pale metallic-y finish or something {disfmarker}
User Interface: Yeah. A metallic-y finish we were thinking.
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} Well I know know it's for rubber.
Marketing: Mm-hmm.
Project Manager: Yeah.
Industrial Designer: I mean diff if you can visualise this in nice colours I think it would look quite fancy. {vocalsound}
User Interface: Polished. Okay {disfmarker} Yeah.
Project Manager: Yeah.
Marketing: Yeah. I kinda {disfmarker} I like the potato look.
Project Manager: It's mango. {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} Oh well, potato, mango, fruit and veg.
User Interface: {vocalsound} We we were {vocalsound} we were thinking about {disfmarker} {vocalsound}
Marketing: It's very different. It's what?
Project Manager: It's mango. {vocalsound}
Marketing: Oh sorry the mango the mango look.
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} Potato's fine. Potato's fine.
User Interface: yeah.
Marketing: {vocalsound} Yeah it is, fruit or vegetable depends on your mood.
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: Yeah. Totally. It's really adaptable.
Marketing: So I myself would say a one or a two.
Project Manager: Yeah. I would say two. Personally.
User Interface: I w I'd say two I think.
Marketing: It's a two?
Industrial Designer: For the
Marketing: Okay,
User Interface: Fanciness.
Marketing: and p
Project Manager: Yeah.
Industrial Designer: fancy {disfmarker}
Marketing: One being true. So {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: I {disfmarker} uh two, three. {vocalsound}
Marketing: Two.
User Interface: Yeah.
Marketing: Okay, actu that's pro that's gonna get confusing, like that. Okay so question number two was {vocalsound} is it techn technologically innovative? So I know we have the kinetic energy which is very innovative.
Project Manager: Yeah.
Industrial Designer: Yeah and the use of the rubber.
Marketing: {vocalsound} Use of the rubber, the use of the L_E_D_.
Industrial Designer: For the anti-R_S_I_.
User Interface: Yeah.
Project Manager: Yeah.
Industrial Designer: The L_E_D_ use isn't particularly innovative
Marketing: Isn't {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: and we don't have any scroll buttons, it's all pushbuttons,
User Interface: Mm.
Industrial Designer: there's no L_C_D_ control, so if we're thinking about the rest of the market, it's sort of probably halfway.
Marketing: Mm-hmm.
Project Manager: Yeah.
Industrial Designer: In some aspects it is, like we said.
Project Manager: Yeah. I'd say maybe three.
User Interface: I'll go for three as well.
Marketing: Yeah. And I think {disfmarker} I mean it it's tough to say because we were {disfmarker} we didn't want it to be any more innovative than this, because then that would've defeated the purpose.
Project Manager: Yeah we want it simple.
Industrial Designer: Yeah. Though it was our specification.
User Interface: No. Wouldn't be simple, yeah.
Marketing: So I mean I {disfmarker} we'll put three, but I think we actually reached our goal.
Project Manager: Yeah.
User Interface: Yeah.
Marketing: {vocalsound} We didn't want it any more than that. Okay question number three. Uh, will it be easy to use?
Project Manager: I think so. Yeah.
Industrial Designer: Yeah. Yeah.
User Interface: Yeah very.
Marketing: Yeah.
User Interface: I think one for that.
Marketing: Yeah. S Yeah
Project Manager: Yeah. One.
Marketing: I think it's {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
User Interface: Yeah.
Marketing: you can't really get confused with that.
User Interface: No.
Project Manager: Th
Marketing: I mean, there'll be s we have to work out the uh number {disfmarker} the plus system.
Project Manager: The plus number thing.
User Interface: Yeah that's the only thing yeah.
Marketing: But once that's figured out, it should be fine.
Industrial Designer: Yeah and perhaps the turning on but {disfmarker}
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Marketing: Number four. Is this a good-looking remote?
Industrial Designer: Mm.
Marketing: Remember that seventy five percent of users find most remote controls ugly.
User Interface: {vocalsound} It's definitely {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Again I think the colour comes into this.
Project Manager: Yeah colour will definitely be a factor.
Marketing: Mm-hmm {vocalsound}.
Project Manager: I think that the logo could be smaller.
Industrial Designer: Okay.
Project Manager: And maybe not such a prominent way.
User Interface: Yeah.
Project Manager: Maybe like at the bottom, kind of.
User Interface: But the {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Not in {disfmarker}
User Interface: Remember the management said that it it had to be prominent.
Project Manager: Oh it just had to be on there I guess.
Marketing: Whoops.
User Interface: Yeah. {vocalsound}
Marketing: Should just not touch it.
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: Don't worry. {vocalsound}
Marketing: {vocalsound} This time it's the three I killed. {vocalsound} I was just wondering if it should be like flatter. Or {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: I suppose I've got quite big hands.
Project Manager: I like the appeal of it being like a big glob in your hand.
Marketing: Well {disfmarker}
User Interface: Yeah.
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
User Interface: But you know what I've just thought of there now. What {disfmarker} where's it gonna sit in your living room? Is it not gonna fall off the arm of the sofa?
Project Manager: Maybe if the bottom was just sort of flat, and then the rest is like
Marketing: Yeah the bottom could be like ch chopped a bit.
User Interface: Yeah.
Project Manager: round.
User Interface: But then it wouldn't sit as comfortably in your hand {vocalsound}.
Marketing: Oh. That's true.
Project Manager: It would still be comfortable I think. We c we could handle it I think.
Industrial Designer: Thing is like that, it's not going anywhere particularly.
User Interface: {vocalsound} Yeah.
Marketing: Maybe, it could {disfmarker} it could be on the bottom, so you wouldn't loo like if it's flat here, so it sits up.
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
Marketing: Like that.
User Interface: Oh that would be nice. {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Ah it'd fall over all the time though. It'd be annoying.
Industrial Designer: Uh yeah, it's less um, what's th ha.
User Interface: Yeah.
Marketing: I g If it's weighted maybe.
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: {vocalsound}'Kay we're done designing.
Industrial Designer: H it's got higher centre of gravity like that.
Marketing: {vocalsound} Details, details. {vocalsound}
Project Manager: {vocalsound} Come on.
Marketing: Okay. So, is this a good-looking remote? {vocalsound} Would we wanna show it off to our friends? {vocalsound}
User Interface: Three. You would though,'cause it's bit {disfmarker} it's more interesting than other remotes.
Marketing: Yeah.
Project Manager: I think, it was another colour and it was like {disfmarker} I think it'd look okay. I think maybe a two.
Marketing: Yeah?
Industrial Designer: I would definitely go for that rather than like your average plain old remote like that,
Marketing: I mean I gue yeah, it's personal taste, but {disfmarker}
User Interface: Yeah.
Marketing: Yeah.
Industrial Designer: but definitely in another colour, I'm not happy with those colours.
Marketing: Okay, so should we say two for that?
Project Manager: Sure.
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
Marketing: Yeah?
User Interface: Yeah.
Marketing: Okay. Uh, question number five. What's um {disfmarker} will people be willing to spend twenty five Euros on this product? Remember that eighty percent of users were willing to spend more money when a remote control looked fancy.
User Interface: I think we have to market it in the right way, that um {disfmarker} to say that it is simplistic.
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
Marketing: Mm-hmm.
User Interface: So people don't just see it and think, uh, this is so simplistic, I don't want to spend twenty five Euros.
Project Manager: Yeah.
User Interface: We have to market it.
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
Marketing: Yeah it {disfmarker} the marketing will have a lot to do with it.
Industrial Designer: And {vocalsound} the kinetic energy, shaker-style-y, whoo,
User Interface: And the kinetic energy part. Yeah.
Project Manager: Yeah. {vocalsound} Durable. {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: ooh no. {vocalsound}
Marketing: {vocalsound} Shake it and the buttons fall off. {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} But you know, those'll be firmly on.
User Interface: {vocalsound} Don't shake {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Oh no the plus. {vocalsound} You're
Marketing: No, I guess, I don't know much about the remote control industry, how much your average sells for,
User Interface: {disfmarker} use the zero.
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
User Interface: {vocalsound} Make a new one.
Project Manager: But you're our Marketing Expert. {vocalsound}
Marketing: but {disfmarker} I know I am, aren't I?
User Interface: I think they're about ten po ten pound, aren't they? About ten pounds. Fifteen?
Marketing: But you don't have to buy batteries. So in the long term this can actually save you money.
Industrial Designer: Mm, yeah, that's true.
User Interface: Yeah.
Project Manager: Oh. Exactly. Exactly.
Marketing: So we'll market it that way too.
Industrial Designer: Yeah. Good point.
Marketing: So yeah I think with a good marketing scheme um and the personalisation options, it'll {disfmarker}
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Yeah. I would give it a two still though.
Industrial Designer: Yeah. Yeah.
User Interface: Mm.
Marketing: Yeah. Okay number six. Can someone read it out?
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} Does this prototype match the operating behaviour of the average user.
Marketing: Or {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Mm.
User Interface: Yeah.
Marketing: Um yeah. So that was mainly that the statistics {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
User Interface: I think it does very well.
Project Manager: Oh yeah.
Industrial Designer: Because {disfmarker}
Marketing: we said {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: yeah, because the most accessible buttons are the volume and the and the channel-changing.
User Interface: The zap {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Yeah.
Industrial Designer: And it's just {disfmarker} you won't have to think about it.
User Interface: yeah.
Marketing: Mm-hmm.
Industrial Designer: You don't have to look down to find them.
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: They're clearly there, easy to use.
Project Manager: Yeah.
Industrial Designer: Simple.
User Interface: Uh {disfmarker}
Marketing: Yeah I guess the {disfmarker} I think the key word there is average,'cause there were some people that used the uh video input and sound and stuff.
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
Marketing: But they're not you and I really.
Industrial Designer: Mm.
Project Manager: Yeah.
Marketing: So. Okay so one?
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
User Interface: Yeah.
Marketing: Okay. Number seven. C Heather could you push it down? Will this remote control be easy to find when lost? Remember that fifty percent of users lose their remote regularly.
Project Manager: We have the alarm system.
Marketing: Now is there the {disfmarker} is the alarm system still {disfmarker} was it implemented?
User Interface: Yeah the bu when you press the alarm system, the {vocalsound} lights {vocalsound} behind the {disfmarker} and it'll vibra {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: It {disfmarker} Yeah
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: l lights on and, or flash as well. But I mean it's not obviously obvious from the outside that that's gonna happen'cause you can't s particularly see an alarm.
User Interface: It'll be again in the marketing.
Project Manager: I thought the light from the inside was gonna light up.
User Interface: Yeah. The light {disfmarker} it will.
Project Manager: Or or was it gonna make a noise?
Industrial Designer: Yeah. But when the alarm's not {disfmarker}
User Interface: But {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: yeah. If you {disfmarker} {vocalsound}
User Interface: But both {disfmarker} {vocalsound}
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: You press the button it makes a noise right?
Marketing: {vocalsound} It turns into a duck and starts quacking.
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
User Interface: Yeah.
Industrial Designer: You could s {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Yeah. Awesome. Awesome.
Industrial Designer: Yeah. {vocalsound}
User Interface: {vocalsound} Oh, that would be brilliant.
Marketing: Here I am.
User Interface: I'd be tempted to {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Well the thing is, if it was {disfmarker} had an alarm system,
Marketing: {vocalsound} Um {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: I mean, when it when it lights up as we I mean it could light up when the alarm went. But if it was hidden underneath the cushion or something, there wouldn't be any point.
User Interface: Yeah.
Industrial Designer: So you can't see the alarm, but it would light up.
User Interface: It would have to be in the market
Project Manager: I though w it was gonna make a noise.
Marketing: Okay.
Industrial Designer: Yeah. Alarm,
User Interface: Yeah but you still couldn't see it.
Industrial Designer: but you can't see an alarm inside uh {disfmarker} the alarm system itself.
User Interface: It would just be a little speaker on the back or something.
Project Manager: Okay.
Marketing: We {disfmarker} oh you're just explaining why it's not on the prototype.
Industrial Designer: Yeah. Yeah. It w yeah.
Marketing: But yeah, it'll be there.
Project Manager: Oh okay.
Marketing: So we can {disfmarker} we could say that {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Whoo. Okay.
Industrial Designer: Sorry.
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Marketing: We can give it a one, because compared to every other remote ever m ever made, this one will be easier to find.
Project Manager: Yeah, totally.
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
Marketing: Okay. Um {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} Sorry Heather.
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: No problem, mm.
Industrial Designer: That wasn't very clear.
Marketing: Question number eight. Will it be easy to learn how to use this remote when brand new? Remember that thirty four percent of users usually found it difficult.
Project Manager: Totally.
Marketing: So it has to be {disfmarker} yeah, it's eas they'll pick it up and they'll know what to do.
User Interface: So the plu the plus {disfmarker} w once that's written down on the page that'll be really simple,
Marketing: The plus thing needs to be worked on.
Project Manager: Yeah.
Industrial Designer: Yeah
User Interface: won't it?
Industrial Designer: I think {disfmarker}
Marketing: Yeah.
Industrial Designer: just because it's {disfmarker} we've decided to reduce it down to the basic buttons, I think that in itself makes it so much easier to use.
Marketing: Well {disfmarker}
User Interface: Yeah.
Marketing: Do {disfmarker} Does it make more sense for the middle one to be an {disfmarker} just an enter button? So then you would have to push two buttons every time at least.
Project Manager: Yeah, so it's just like channel six, six, enter.
User Interface: That kind of annoys me though, when it's zero six when you have to press {disfmarker}
Marketing: {gap}
Industrial Designer: Mm.
Project Manager: Yeah but you don't have to press zeros.
User Interface: I don't know why. {vocalsound}
Marketing: You could just press six enter,
User Interface: Oh okay. Right.
Project Manager: And then like twelve, enter.
Industrial Designer: And {disfmarker} or sixty six enter, y
Marketing: or one two enter.
User Interface: Alright, aye.
Marketing: Yeah.
Project Manager: Yeah.
Industrial Designer: Yeah I think that's probably more straightforward. Yeah. Good {gap} {vocalsound}
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
User Interface: Yeah.
Marketing: Um, okay so we can {vocalsound} {disfmarker}
User Interface: I'd say w yeah one.
Marketing: we'll say yes it's uh one?
Project Manager: Yeah.
User Interface: Yeah.
Marketing: Okay.
Industrial Designer: Ooh. Mm.
Marketing: Question number nine.
Industrial Designer: Oh.
Marketing: Uh, will it minimise the effects of R_S_I_, which was repeated strain injury?
Industrial Designer: Injury.
User Interface: Yeah.
Marketing: Um, which affected over a quarter of users.
User Interface: {vocalsound} Hmm.
Marketing: S
Project Manager: I think so. It's like right in the {disfmarker}
User Interface: But if you're zapping {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Your thumb might get a little bit uh {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Yeah, that's what I was thinking.
User Interface: yeah. I don't think it will f
Industrial Designer: We may have to do some more research into other strain injuries that we don't know about.
User Interface: Yeah,
Project Manager: Yeah.
User Interface: the biology.
Project Manager: But it is soft.
Industrial Designer: Mm-hmm.
Marketing: It's soft,
Project Manager: And that's kind of what the um
Marketing: and {disfmarker}
User Interface: Mm.
Industrial Designer: Mm.
Project Manager: the PowerPoint slide thing said would be good for R_S_I_,
Marketing: And people could {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
User Interface: Yeah.
Marketing: Mm-hmm.
Project Manager: so {disfmarker} maybe it is but {disfmarker}
Marketing: I don't know what other options there are.
Industrial Designer: I think we're getting {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Yeah.
Industrial Designer: that's true.
Marketing: Could {disfmarker} I mean, you could hold it in your left hand and d use your index finger.
Industrial Designer: Mm.
Marketing: But there's not really any other options unless it's like a keyboard.
Project Manager: Yeah.
User Interface: Yeah.
Marketing: So, I think we did as as much as you can with a remote control.
Project Manager: Yeah.
Marketing: So, one or two do you think?
Industrial Designer: I think {disfmarker}
User Interface: I I'd say t
Industrial Designer: yeah, I think too.
User Interface: two. Yeah
Project Manager: Yeah.
Marketing: Two okay. Okay number ten. Did we somehow incorporate the company colour and logo?
Project Manager: Yes we did.
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
User Interface: Yeah. {vocalsound}
Marketing: Now is the colour gonna be there even if it's like vanilla?
User Interface: {vocalsound} N We we can't really do that
Marketing: Is the yellow {disfmarker}
User Interface: because for example on the banana theme we can't have it as being yellow.
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
User Interface: It won't stand out.
Marketing: Mm-hmm.
User Interface: So n it's not always gonna be the same colour.
Marketing: It sounds like the colour's something that we {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Well, yeah the colours are yellow and grey.
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
User Interface: Gray, yeah.
Project Manager: So it could be grey on the banana one.
User Interface: Yeah, could be grey.
Project Manager: Yeah.
Marketing: But I mean the yell yeah d yellow's ugly though,
User Interface: Yeah that's right,
Marketing: depending on the {disfmarker}
User Interface: we didn't even rea
Marketing: So I think we'll have to talk to our executive managers, and see if we can get away with just the R_R_.
Industrial Designer: Mm. Yeah. I think this is the
User Interface: Yeah.
Industrial Designer: the factor that we've been least successful in confronting.
Marketing: Okay.
User Interface: Perhaps a metallic
Project Manager: Mm, yeah.
User Interface: or or {disfmarker} like that's grey, and it wouldn't be that expensive to have a little bit of metal. No?
Marketing: Yeah.
User Interface: That isn't rubber.
Marketing: And the buttons in the middle.
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: Yeah. {vocalsound}
Marketing: Okay So, do you think that's more of a three then? Three, four?
Industrial Designer: Four I think. Well I don't {disfmarker}
Marketing: Four?
Industrial Designer: what do {disfmarker} what {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Hum.
Marketing: Well we have good reasons for it, so we {disfmarker} but we can still put a a four?
Industrial Designer: Okay.
User Interface: Okay.
Marketing: Okay, and final question. {vocalsound} Um, did we stay true to our motto and put the fashion into electronics?
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Marketing: Current trends of fruits and veggies, desire for sponginess. {vocalsound}
Project Manager: I would say so.
Marketing: {vocalsound}
User Interface: Following that briefing we did.
Project Manager: But maybe more like two'cause there's no like pictures of fruit, it's just sort of naming it by a fruit.
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
User Interface: Yeah.
Project Manager: With the with the colours.
Marketing: Yeah.
Industrial Designer: Like um the colour scheme names and stuff.
User Interface: Yeah.
Marketing: No, uh, are the plates interchangeable?
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
User Interface: Yeah.
Marketing: I think I missed a few {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Yeah.
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
Marketing: they are? So you can have banana and kiwi and {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Yeah.
Industrial Designer: Yeah. Yeah.
User Interface: Yeah. {vocalsound}
Marketing: okay. Okay, so that's something that's kind of in the making too, like maybe it'll become more {disfmarker}
Project Manager: That's fashionable in itself to have interchangeable plates.
Marketing: Mm-hmm.
Industrial Designer: It is.
User Interface: I think w yeah, I think one. Well that was our brief and we followed the brief.
Industrial Designer: The thing is, I think if somebody saw that and you said what was that inspired from, I don't know if you'd instantly say mango.
User Interface: Well we haven't got a big banana but {disfmarker} Oh yeah. {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Be like {disfmarker}
User Interface: No. {vocalsound} No. {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Yeah.
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Maybe if it was scented.
User Interface: {vocalsound} Oh that would be class. {vocalsound}
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: Oh yeah. There we go. That would be great.
Project Manager: {vocalsound} Yeah we have money for that. Um {disfmarker}
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: {vocalsound} Alright so based on this evaluation, do we average them out sorta thing?
Industrial Designer: Um {disfmarker}
Marketing: Yes we do. So I {disfmarker} wh what was I gonna put for that?
Project Manager: Oh.
Marketing: A two for fashion?
Project Manager: I would say two.
User Interface: Yeah. Two.
Industrial Designer: Okay.
Marketing: Okay, so our average there, five, six, eight, ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen, fifteen, nineteen, twenty one, divided by eleven
Project Manager: One point nine or something?
User Interface: It's {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: It's {disfmarker}
Marketing: is {disfmarker}
User Interface: Yeah.
Project Manager: {vocalsound} I don't know these things. Um, between one and two.
Industrial Designer: Between one and two.
Marketing: Between {disfmarker} okay.
Industrial Designer: So that's pretty fantastic.
User Interface: Close to two.
Marketing: {vocalsound} Um.
User Interface: Yeah.
Marketing: Yeah, that's very good'cause the highest we coulda got is one.
Project Manager: Alright.
User Interface: I got {disfmarker}
Marketing: Does that seem right then?
User Interface: Yeah,'cause we've a four to bring down.
Industrial Designer: Mm.
Marketing: Okay.
User Interface: Uh, aye.
Industrial Designer: It seems like it should be more around two.
Project Manager: Yeah.
User Interface: Yeah. Uh, should've added five.
Industrial Designer: Do we have an online calculator?
Project Manager: I'm attempting to do that {vocalsound} right now.
User Interface: {vocalsound} This is {gap}.
Industrial Designer: Okay.
Project Manager: Yeah it is one point nine. Ooh.
Industrial Designer: Oh wow. Well done.
User Interface: Yay.
Project Manager: Go Heather Pauls.
Industrial Designer: Well that's excellent.
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Yeah. {vocalsound} Alright, now with that over and done with, our next step is to see if we are under budget. And um my computer's frozen. And now it's not. Okay. So um in our shared folder, if everyone could go there right now, um I'm going to um steal a cable.
Marketing: Sorry. Are you gonna do that? Okay.
Project Manager: Um it's it's um
User Interface: Is that the project document?
Project Manager: it's an Excel file. Oh.
Industrial Designer: Production costs.
Project Manager: Yeah.
User Interface: Yeah.
Project Manager:'Kay there we go. Um, production costs. And um I have to access that as well. One moment. {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: It says it {disfmarker}
Project Manager:'Kay so far I've added what I think {disfmarker} or what is going on? Great. It's blinking at me. It's locked for editing. Read only. I'm gonna open up a second one then'cause it's locked for editing. I have the original in my um my email account.
Marketing: Oh is it locked'cause I'm in it?
Project Manager: I dunno.
Industrial Designer: I think it just means that we can't add any more to it now.
Marketing: Or {disfmarker} okay.
Industrial Designer: Have you have you completed it?
Project Manager: No. No, I was hoping that you guys could.
Industrial Designer: Oh right. Okay. Okay.
Project Manager: Um, there we go.
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Okay here we go. So we need to tally up how much our w our product will be costing. So um if you can look up at the screen, um the large screen,
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
Project Manager: oh I guess looking at your own too and telling me which one you think. Okay we're using kinetic which is quite a large expense at three Euros.
Industrial Designer: Yeah. {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Um we're using a regular chip.
User Interface: Oh right.
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
Project Manager: Um, it's cur it's double curved, so its curved all around.
Industrial Designer: Double double-curved yeah.
Project Manager: That's another three. We're already at five. Um, we're using plastic and rubber,
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
Project Manager: so {disfmarker} Good thing plastic is free, we're at eight. Um {disfmarker} S
User Interface: What about a special colour?
Project Manager: Yeah.
User Interface: Are we using that?
Project Manager: I guess we should do it just for one kind. So it's like special colour {disfmarker} well we'll have two colours
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
Project Manager: right? Well one colour for the case, one colour for the buttons.
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
Project Manager: So we can {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Mm-hmm.
User Interface: Yeah.
Project Manager: Um, we have push button interface, so that's inexpensive. And um we have a special colour for the button, and we also have a special form. And a special material.
User Interface: And a special material. Yeah.
Project Manager: Which puts us just barely under budget.
Industrial Designer: Oof.
Project Manager: Hurray.
Industrial Designer: Congratulations guys.
Project Manager: Yeah. Good work guys.
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Marketing: Mm.'S good. {vocalsound}
Project Manager: So um our operating cost is twelve twenty Euros.
User Interface: That's good.
Project Manager: Awesome. And back to our PowerPoint. So we've {disfmarker}'Kay. Yes we are. So we need to do a product evaluation, again,
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: which is probably um {disfmarker} I dunno. A different extension of a {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Of the actual project rather than the product?
User Interface: Yeah.
Project Manager: Hmm.
Industrial Designer: A project? Is is {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Yeah'cause we're talking about leadership, teamwork.
Industrial Designer: yeah. So wh how we actually went round uh about doing it.
Project Manager: Yeah. Alright so um {disfmarker} Do you guys feel like there was room for creativity?
Industrial Designer: I think we were pushed.
Marketing: Mm-hmm.
Project Manager: Pushed for creativity?
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: I mean we weren't really given a lot of time, or materials, yeah, to go about our design task.
User Interface: The ma Or materials. {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: So I think we could've done with a bit more time.
User Interface: Yeah.
Project Manager: Ye Okay.
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: So it'd be like need more time and materials. But you were allowed m creativity?
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
Project Manager: I think so as like {disfmarker} but you were supposed to have creativ
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
Marketing: Yeah and the conceptual and functional. Like we were very creative in in coming up with an idea I guess, but m
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
User Interface: Yeah.
Industrial Designer: Well we were just limited by resources really and like if we had decided to use the L_C_D_ screen, and like solar power backup and everything, then we wouldn't have been able to afford that.
Marketing: When we can down to it.
User Interface: Yeah.
Project Manager: Right.
Marketing: Okay.
Industrial Designer: So that did limit creativity.
User Interface: Creativity.
Project Manager: Right
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} Just resources.
Marketing: Mm-hmm.
Project Manager: Okay
Industrial Designer: But yeah. The fruit and veg idea. {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Great.
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Leadership? Is this me being like, guys do you like me? Um. {vocalsound}
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Marketing: {vocalsound} Yeah {vocalsound}.
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Marketing: {vocalsound} Good leadership, I think we stayed on task.
User Interface: Yeah.
Project Manager: Yeah.
Industrial Designer: Yeah we did. We've, uh {disfmarker} seeing as we've come out with what we intended. A pro um a product within the budget. I think that's a sign of good leadership
Marketing: Mm-hmm.
Industrial Designer: and also our personal coach helped us along the way,
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Yeah.
Industrial Designer: so you know {disfmarker} I think it's been fine.
Marketing: And the timing was good. We never were pushed for time, or sat around doing nothing, so {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Yeah. Good timing.
User Interface: Yeah.
Project Manager: Oop {gap} Okay.
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Teamwork?
Industrial Designer: And project manager of course.
Project Manager: I think we worked great as a team. Yeah?
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
User Interface: Yeah.
Marketing: {vocalsound} Was good teamwork. I think we are well-suited to our roles.
User Interface: Yeah.
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Alright how were our means?
Industrial Designer: Um {disfmarker}
Project Manager: We needed more Play Doh colours.
User Interface: Yeah. {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: Yeah and more Play Doh,
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer:'cause that was all the red we had.
Project Manager: Yeah.
Industrial Designer: So even if we wanted to make a bigger prototype, we wouldn't have been able to.
User Interface: Yeah, it c it might've been bigger. {vocalsound}
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
Marketing: Oh really?
Project Manager: {vocalsound} But ever everything else was satisfactory?
Marketing: Okay.
Project Manager: Is that good {disfmarker}
User Interface: Yeah.
Marketing: Yeah. The computer programmes are good.
Industrial Designer: Yeah. It could be really straightforward for the computer.
Marketing: The {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: I think the only thing was having to remember to you know to tick the okays
Marketing: Yeah. I don't think there was anything {disfmarker}
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Marketing: {vocalsound} Yeah.
Industrial Designer: but I think I was the only one who struggled with that. {vocalsound}
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Marketing: {vocalsound}
User Interface: I'm actually not sure if I've saved my presentations. {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Yeah?
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: Mm. Uh me too.
Marketing: They'll probably still be there.
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
Project Manager: New ideas found. I don't really know what that means.
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: Well I think we've all learnt stuff from each other,
Marketing: Um {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: like the n um {disfmarker}
User Interface: Yeah. Through discussion.
Industrial Designer: yeah. Just about each different {gap}. Got new ideas from each other. {vocalsound}
Marketing: I'm not sure, new ideas found.
Project Manager: Hmm?
Marketing: Yeah well I guess we really {disfmarker} it {disfmarker} we bounced off of each other, which was cool.
Project Manager: Yeah.
User Interface: Yeah.
Marketing: Like based on marketing stuff and then you'd say something about interface and {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
Project Manager: Yeah.
Marketing: yeah, worked well.
User Interface: And we were a able to modify each other's ideas
Marketing: Mm-hmm.
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
User Interface: to fit in with our areas of expertise. {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Yeah. Each other's {gap}
Marketing: Oh does it have smart materials by the way?
Industrial Designer: Sorry?
Marketing: Does it have smart materials?
Project Manager: Mm.
Industrial Designer: Oh yeah. {vocalsound}
Marketing: Oh yeah. {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: Well mm, did it come into the into {disfmarker}
User Interface: If if it if it {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: I dunno if we counted that in the costs. {vocalsound}
User Interface: If it can be afforded.
Project Manager: {vocalsound} Okay? Well with that achieved, our last slide is our closing slide.
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Yes our costs are within budget. It's evaluated generally positively.
Industrial Designer: Yes.
Marketing: Mm-hmm.
User Interface: Yeah.
Project Manager: And um don't forget to complete final questionnaire and meeting summary.
Marketing: Mm-hmm.
Project Manager: Then we celebrate
Industrial Designer: Uh. Fantastic.
User Interface: Yay.
Marketing: {vocalsound} By watching T_V_? {vocalsound}
Project Manager: in such a way that I have no idea.
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: Okay, brilliant.
Project Manager: Alright?
Industrial Designer: Thank you very much. {vocalsound}
User Interface: Yeah.
Project Manager: Okay, bye. {vocalsound}
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Marketing: Mm. Conclusion? Dadada.","Firstly, User Interface introduced the prototype of remote control based on the previous discussion of its function. The prototype was a pretty simple design in a mango shape with the company logo on it and innovative functions like the plus button. Secondly, Marketing designed an evaluation test under the guidance of both the conceptual as well as functional meetings and the team gave one to seven points to each feature of the product to see if the prototype would meet the original requirements and goals. Thirdly, the team calculated the cost of the prototype and found that the most expensive part was the use of kinetic. But the team decided to use regular chips and cheap materials, which made the budget under control. Lastly, the team gave positive feedback on the project and the process.",qmsum
"What do the group think of the question whether the eligibility for free school meals is the best measure?
Lynne Neagle AM: Good morning, everyone, and welcome to this morning's Children, Young People and Education Committee. We've received no apologies for absence. Can I ask Members who are present if they wish to declare any interests? Okay, thank you. Item 2 this morning is our final evidence session for our inquiry into targeted funding to improve educational outcomes. I'm very pleased to welcome Kirsty Williams AM, Cabinet Secretary for Education; Steve Davies, director of the education directorate; and Ruth Conway, deputy director, support for learners division. Welcome to all of you, and thank you for your attendance and also for the paper that you've provided in advance. If you're happy, we'll go straight into questions, and the first questions are from Llyr Gruffydd.
Llyr Gruffydd AM: Bore da. I just want to start by asking some questions around the targeting of the pupil development grant because, clearly, we've had a lot of evidence around this apparent blurring of eligibility to an extent. I'm just wondering how comfortable you are that the money is being targeted appropriately because, clearly, it's being targeted more widely than just those eligible for free school meals, from some of the evidence we've had, but also that it seems to be predominantly focused on low-attaining frees--pupils who are eligible for free school meals.
Kirsty Williams AM: Thank you, Llyr. I think it's important to be absolutely clear that when it comes to individual interventions, those individual interventions should only be targeted at those children who are eligible for free school meals. But in some cases, schools may use their PDG funding to provide a universal intervention, but we would want to--in challenge advisers'discussions in schools--we'd want to have evidence that that universal intervention would have a disproportionate effect on the outcomes for children on free school meals. So, for instance, if I give you an example in your own region, Llyr: at Brynteg County Primary School in Wrexham, if you look at that primary school in Wrexham, their results for free-school-meal children at the end of their primary school period in school are equivalent to their non-free-school-meal counterparts. So, there is no differentiation in those results. One of the things that they've used their PDG for is to really focus on the concept of growth mindset in school. So, that's a universal thing that they've trained all the teachers in, but what we know is that that has a disproportionate effect on those children who are on free school meals. So, if you're familiar with the concept of a growth mindset, it's about really challenging learners to think that,'I can do things. If sometimes I fail, I pick myself up, I'm more resilient.'Now, that has been, as I said, trained to all the teachers in the school--it's an ethos for the whole school--but we have seen that the impact on the free-school-meal children has been even greater, and now they're at the same level. So, that's the important distinction. Individual intervention per child has to be targeted at those children who are eligible for free school meals, but sometimes a school will employ a whole-school approach to train their staff, for instance, and that, then, has to demonstrate it has a disproportionate effect on free school meals. So, growth mindset; it may be attachment disorder training for staff, for instance, where we know it's of benefit to everybody, but will have particular benefits for that cohort of students. With regard to more able and talented, you know, Llyr, that this is an area of concern for me, generally, within the Welsh education system; that we've not been particularly good at identifying, supporting and driving attainment for those children. I'm absolutely clear that PDG needs to be used for those children who are eligible to drive potential, whatever the potential of that child is, including more able and talented. And again, I'll give you an example that has been seen as good practice in Pembrokeshire: a window on the world bus, again paid for by schools. I don't know if you're aware of it.
Llyr Gruffydd AM: We've heard about that.
Kirsty Williams AM: Oh, you've heard about it; well, it's a really good example the window on the world. And, again, that's very much targeted at raising aspirations and giving children who are more able and talented, who are eligible for PDG, those experiences, and to really push them. So, yes, I'm absolutely clear that PDG shouldn't just be seen to be getting individuals to the average. For those children who are more able and talented, it should be used to support them--
Llyr Gruffydd AM: And we all share those aspirations, I'm sure, and you pointed to examples of good practice, but of course, it's not universal, is it, so what I'm asking is: do you think that the guidance is sufficient as it is? Do you think that there's a great enough awareness of how the PDG should be used at the coalface? And also, are you confident that consortia and others have the measures in place to be able to demonstrate that it is being used properly?
Kirsty Williams AM: I think, if we look at what Estyn has said about PDG, it does actually recognise that the PDG is being used to push more able and talented children, but as always with the system, Llyr, it's whether we can be sure that that is strategic and that it's happening across all of our schools. So, you're--
Llyr Gruffydd AM: But not just in relation to more able and talented, I'm referring to the eligibility and the targeting.
Kirsty Williams AM: Oh, the eligibility. You'll be aware that, on the advice of Sir Alasdair, we have employed and appointed new PDG regional advisers, and I think their role is going to be absolutely crucial in spreading that good practice across the region, whether that's use of PDG for more able and talented, or ensuring that PDG is used in the appropriate way. So, that's there to provide strategic overall advice. And obviously, we have been very clear with regional challenge advisers, in the relationship and the conversations they're having with individual schools, that they're really challenging their schools about the use of PDG, not just in terms of targeting, but the programmes, what the money is being spent on, whether there is an evidence base for that and whether we are clear on impact. So, I think the new regional advisers are going to be crucial in enabling us to ensure more consistent practice across the regions.
Llyr Gruffydd AM: So, are you content that eligibility for free school meals is the best measure, really, of identifying which pupils to target?
Kirsty Williams AM: Llyr, in the absence of anything better. I'll be the first person to say that maybe it's not as absolutely focused, but in the absence of anything different to identify a proxy for need, I think it's probably the best that we've got at present. And we will continue to have discussions with local government about whether there are different ways. We have to be mindful. Some of the policy levers in this area are out of my hands, so if we look at the roll-out of universal credit, for instance, we've got officials working very hard at the moment to try and understand what universal credit is going to mean and where we are going to be able to identify relative need, going forward. We haven't had any additional resource as a result of this, but we're very mindful that, potentially, this has an impact, going forward. And, officials are working all of the time, I must say, in conjunction with the department in England, to understand their thinking in this area so that we are in a position to make some decisions about what a notional eligibility for free school meals will look like going forward, but before I make any decisions, I want to assure everybody that there will be a full public consultation on that.
Llyr Gruffydd AM: Okay. Finally for now, on this issue of once a year, in January, if you're eligible for free school meals, then you're in that group for that year. We've had some quite strong evidence about how difficult that makes longer term planning for a number of schools and we've also been pointed in the direction of what's happened in England with the Ever 6, and I'm just wondering whether you're giving any thought to maybe changing that a little bit.
Kirsty Williams AM: Well, we're certainly giving thought to flexibility. In conversations with Alasdair, who is our independent adviser on this agenda, and individual schools, we're actively giving thought to greater flexibility and maybe longer term projections, so that schools know, for a number of years ahead, what their allocation will be. There are advantages to that system, because you could give that flexibility, you could give that long-term approach, but then, how do you make that responsive if a school suddenly has more children? We do know that, actually, the number of free-school-meal pupils is dropping. But there can be changes, you know, regional working in areas of north Wales in tourism, or maybe in other areas at Christmas time, parents are able to get a period of work. So, how can we create a more flexible system? We're actively looking at that at the moment. I wouldn't use it as an Ever 6 concept, but as an'Ever 2'concept. We have looked at Ever 6, and I'm going to be absolutely blunt with you: to introduce an Ever 6 concept for Wales would mean in the region of identifying an additional PS40 million. I'm going to be absolutely straight and blunt with you: we're not in a position at the moment to be able to identify an additional PS40 million to introduce an Ever 6. But issues around flexibility, certainly, are actively under consideration. In fact, we'll be having a discussion later on today about decisions, going forward, for the next two years.
Llyr Gruffydd AM: Thank you.
Lynne Neagle AM: Darren on this.
Darren Millar AM: It's just a very brief point in response to the PS40 million price ticket that you just put on that. That's, of course, assuming that you maintain the current level of PDG, yes? So, if you reduced the level of PDG slightly, but made it available to more individuals, if you like, via allocating it in a different way, then that PS40 million price ticket wouldn't be there, would it?
Kirsty Williams AM: I was asked a question about had I ever considered an Ever 6. We have looked at that, we've priced that up. I have to make decisions in the envelope of resources that are available to me. We could, indeed, change the way in which we allocate PDG money, but we have to do it within the envelope that is available to me, over PS90 million. That's a significant level of investment, but, of course, as always, Darren, we could cut the amount per pupil, but that might have quite challenging swings in allocations. What we have done--because what I am clear on is that there was evidence to suggest that in the secondary sector, a great deal of PDG was being focused on years 10 and 11, especially year 11, in catch-up provision, and you'll be aware, because we've said this in evidence to the committee in the papers, we've set a challenge to secondary schools to say,'Actually, the majority of your PDG allocation has to be used in key stage 3.'Now, we have to balance the needs, the moral hazard of turning round to children in years 10 and 11 and saying,'We're not going to provide catch-up opportunities for you,'because, clearly, those children need that support. But the evidence and the advice that we're receiving is: actually, strong focus on early years, primary and key stage 3, if we get that right, should negate the need for spending money on catch-up at years 10 and 11. That's why we, in our advice to local authorities and schools, say that we want to see evidence that they're spending this money earlier on in a child's career, rather than just a scramble at year 11 to say,'Right, we've got to get you through your exams.'Darren Millar AM: Okay, but have you actively considered, then, reducing the level you have?
Kirsty Williams AM: We've--
Ruth Conway: Sorry--I was just going to say that one of the things is looking at the scope of the definition, and I think it's about being more flexible with the definition, rather than reducing the amount per head.
Darren Millar AM: Okay. Thank you.
Lynne Neagle AM: Thank you. If we can go on, then, to talk about some of the practical uses of the PDG, you write in your written paper that'the majority of schools are making well thought out and appropriate decisions'on how to use it. But Estyn reported that only two thirds of primary and secondary schools make effective use of the PDG. Given that we've had it now for six years, would you not have expected there to be a higher level of schools actually making good use of that funding?
Kirsty Williams AM: Well, to flip it on its head, the vast majority of schools, as identified by Estyn, are using this money to good effect. So, that's the way I like to see it--that the vast majority of schools are doing well. What Estyn has also indicated is the intrinsic link here to leadership within individual schools, and as you'll be aware, leadership, improving capacity in leadership and developing leadership talent in the Welsh education system is a key priority for me in our national mission. Of course, that's being developed in a different work stream. I think what's fair to say is that the use of PDG is evolving over time. I think we are seeing, increasingly, more and more schools understanding how best to deploy that money for best effect for students. So, if we're honest, when PDG first started, I think, in some schools it was spent on investing in tracking of children, because they'd never thought about tracking these children, they didn't have systems in place to look at the performance of these children, and to have a system in place. So we've moved now from spending money on the infrastructure around support for FSM children into actual inputs in terms of teaching and learning. We're also seeing from Estyn that, actually, in terms of money following the evidence of what we know works, Estyn says that PDG is probably the best example of schools following tried and tested and evidence-based interventions to deploy the money. But clearly we want all of this money to be deployed as well as it can be, and again we come back to the decision I've made to appoint regional PDG advisers so that we can get that better consistency of approach. We are, in the discussions that I have with the regional consortia about how they challenge individual schools on usage, looking for very clear evidence of schools using the Sutton Trust toolkit, and we could have a discussion about whether that's the right thing, because that's on my mind too. But we want to see schools demonstrating their evidence base, and if they're not, if a school isn't doing that, okay, so demonstrate to us why you've made those decisions and, crucially, what are you doing as the school to judge whether that decision is actually making a difference for your individual pupils. So, if you're moving away from tried and tested interventions, what we know works, if you're doing something different with your money, okay, you need to justify that and you need to explain how you're going to demonstrate impact. But I think what we're seeing is increasing good practice in this area as the PDG develops and as our understanding of our school-to-school working in our self-improving school system also develops. I think we're seeing better usage of the money year on year.
Lynne Neagle AM: Thank you. Llyr on this.
Llyr Gruffydd AM: You mentioned some schools will be moving from the tried-and-tested interventions, really, and I'm just wondering to what extent that evolution of use of PDG is being driven by cuts to core funding.
Kirsty Williams AM: No, I don't think it's being driven by cuts to core funding. I think there has been--. One of the biggest impacts of PDG has not been--well, I suppose it is the money in itself, because the money has concentrated the minds, hasn't it? So, one of the most important things that PDG has done is highlight the importance of this agenda within schools, and really raise this up in the thinking of leadership and senior management teams in our schools, and has driven a focus on scrutiny and accountability in the systems that are working with our schools. I think the changing use of PDG reflects the journeys that schools have been on, some of them from a very low base where this was not a priority for them, to better understanding, and as research and as intelligence grows over time in this area, both in Wales and outside of Wales, schools are increasingly learning to use that evidence to tailor approaches in their schools.
Llyr Gruffydd AM: So you wouldn't accept at all that some of this money's being used to paper over some funding cracks from elsewhere. Because the unions and some others have told us that, whether we like it or not, there is some of that going on.
Kirsty Williams AM: As I said, Llyr, we're very clear about the usage that this money can be spent on in terms of individuals or universal application within schools, and that forms an important part of the checks and balances that we have in our system. Can we continue to improve, and ensure that more and more of our schools are employing best practice? Yes, we can, and as I've said, we've taken steps to put in place the infrastructure to support that.
Lynne Neagle AM: Thank you. Mark's questions are next.
Mark Reckless AM: Cabinet Secretary, how would you assess the impact of PDG on attendance and hopefully subsequent engagement with education from children who have free school meals?
Kirsty Williams AM: I think what's important to note is that, as Estyn have themselves said, over the period of the last inspection report, we have seen improvements in attendance, but I do think we need to, again, look at how PDG can support this particular agenda. And as always in the Welsh education system, there are some excellent examples of how schools use the money to address this. Ysgol y Preseli in Pembrokeshire is a very good example of how they've deployed their money. Forgive me; I can't off the top of my head remember the name of the primary school I visited, again in north Wales, where the school has proactively used this money, and they actually send teaching assistants out of school in the morning before the start of the school day, and they actually have a walking bus. They call at homes for children, and they walk the children to the breakfast club. So, they're proactively going out into the community and making sure that those children are in the classrooms, because the teacher said,'We recognised we had a problem with attendance. We tried a variety of means of improving that, but in the end we have taken this quite bold step--we actually send the staff out and they create that walking bus, and they walk the children into school'. They say that they know that, for some of those children, because of the difficult circumstances they and their families are living in, they probably wouldn't be in school if it wasn't for that proactive approach. So, we're looking again at what more we can do to support this particular agenda in terms of improving attendance, because although, again, there are examples of good practice, there is still a gap between the attendance of free-school-meal pupils and non-free-school-meal pupils. And, of course, we can have the best curriculum in the world with really high-quality teaching, but unless the children are in the classes then we're not going to make the difference for them. Whilst that differential exists, then it's going to be hard to close the attainment gap for those children.
Mark Reckless AM: I was actually quite shocked just reading in advance of this meeting that the proportion attending 95 per cent or more, who have pretty full attendance, was only 35 per cent for free-school-meal children at level 4, compared to 60 per cent for non-free-school-meal pupils. It still is an extraordinary difference. My colleague here showed me, I think, last week, a graph showing the link between attendance and attainment, in particular. When people were absent, a lot of the--. As I'm sure you're aware, there's a huge connection. What more can PDG do to deal with it? In the example you give I can see how a school with an awful lot of free-school-meal children could do that, but a lot of the free-school-meal children are actually in schools that don't have that high a proportion of free school meals, where it would be much more challenging to bring in that type of initiative.
Kirsty Williams AM: Yes, indeed, and I think it gets more challenging the older the children get. I think it's more difficult to find interventions that are successful higher up, so key stage 4. So, you can do a walking bus with little ones, can't you, but I don't suppose your average 15 or 16-year-old is going to take very kindly to that. So, you do need a different approach to that. But again, we see in Ysgol y Preseli the employment of staff to directly work with families of older children to reinforce the messages around, as you quite rightly say, the linkage between attendance and attainment, and really work with individual families to understand the barriers to attendance: what's going on in the family that is preventing that child from going to school, and what more can the school do to address those situations. But you're absolutely right; there is more that we need to do to address this particular agenda of attainment. I don't know if there's anything extra you wanted to add, Steve.
Steve Davies: There is also another very good example--and I take what you say about where there are small numbers--but in our secondary schools where there are significant numbers, they're investing PDG in resources like a school nurse and a school counsellor, not just to work with the children but link to other agencies on whom the children and the families are dependent to support them in terms of working with schools. So, it's something, particularly in our most challenging areas, where it cannot just be delivered within the school. So, good use of that resource is being made to employ people to support them in those wider areas.
Mark Reckless AM: Thank you. To what extent is PDG also used to seek to reduce the higher rates of exclusion for children entitled to free school meals?
Kirsty Williams AM: So, if we looked at permanent exclusions, there isn't a differential, but if we look at temporary exclusions, there we see there is a disproportionate number of children on free school meals that are subject to those exclusions. Again, I think what schools employing best practice understand is that you need a multi-agency approach to supporting that particular child. Some of those exclusions can be as a result of the need to address other issues going on in a child's life. So, this is where we come back to the committee's work, for instance, on mental health and support for children, support for behaviour in school. So, again, it's a multi-agency approach that I think we need, and, in our good schools, our really, really good schools, there's a recognition of that need to have a whole team around a child to support that child in education. With EOTAS, we made some changes last year regarding PDG for EOTAS. So, for those children who do find themselves in education other than at school, we are providing additional support that previously was not available.
Mark Reckless AM: Thank you.
Lynne Neagle AM: Okay. We're going to move on now to talk about the impact of PDG on attainment. Hefin David has got some questions.
Hefin David AM: It appears that the attainment gap at 2017 has actually widened, in spite of PDG levels. Is that correct?
Kirsty Williams AM: Yes. So, if you look at it--with the usual caveats about whether you can make direct comparisons on level 2 plus between the exams the year before and the exams that we had last summer--on the face of it, the gap has increased. I think what's important to recognise, Hefin, is a direction of travel. I'm sure we all want to, because I want to, have a discussion about why children on free school meals were less resilient in the exam system last year. But, if we look at the period that we have been employing PDG, over that period, we have seen a narrowing of the gap. I think what's quite stark, if we think about it--. So, if we look at where we started from: in 2009, one in five children on free school meals got level 2 plus--one in five--by 2016, we had got that down to one in three. Obviously, there's still a way to go, but, Sir Alasdair, who knows about these things, says that that is a significant improvement. Last year, we got some challenges. We need to understand why that happened, but I do think it's--
Hefin David AM: Why, do you think?
Kirsty Williams AM: Why, do I think? What I do think is there is no one answer. There is no one answer to this. I think we could look at and we can have discussions around the move from BTEC to science GCSEs. I think we have supplied figures to the committee about the significant change in the number of children on free school meals who weren't doing a single science GCSE and are now doing science GCSEs. We can look at the unintended consequences of literature. Again, we've supplied figures. Where children have done language and literature, whether that be through the medium of English or through the medium of Welsh, there is more resilience. So, it's that exposure to literacy in all its forms that I think could potentially make a difference. So, I think there's no one answer to why free-school-meal children were not so resilient last year. We continue to have discussions with Qualifications Wales to get a better understanding of this. At my next ministerial policy board, in May, we'll be doing a deep dive into this particular subject.
Hefin David AM: So, to what extent would exam boards be responsible for lack of grade stability?
Kirsty Williams AM: It could be one of the contributory factors. What I think is important is that there is no one, single reason why there seems to be less resilience in this cohort of children.
Hefin David AM: Will you be speaking to the exam boards about this and raising concerns?
Kirsty Williams AM: I have written to Qualifications Wales, we've had discussions about it, but I've asked them to formally submit evidence ahead of my policy board for May, where, as I said, we will be doing a formal, deep-dive discussion across the department about these issues. But, again, Hefin, what we've got to be clear on is--while we look at overall factors, you know, our overall national statistic--we did see some schools last year whose FSM performance was better than it had been the year before. So, what was it in those schools that enabled those children to do really well, whereas, in other schools, the performance was different? Even in individual cities, you can see a huge variety of performance. So, take Cardiff and Swansea, our two biggest cities. You've got schools in those cities with comparative levels of free school meals. So, you could have really high-performing schools with a very small number of the cohort on free school meals. The difference between those performances in a single city--so, that's the same local education authority and the same regional consortium--you can see a massive change. There's one school I can talk to: their free-school-meal performance is 88 per cent. A similar school in the same city with the same proportion of children on free school meals, their performance is down in the 20 per cents. So, I think what's important is that we can't draw broad-brush conclusions. For me, the challenge is to go into individual schools and understand what was happening in that particular school that ensured that their children did really well. We've got one school in Swansea, their FSM performance at GCSE level 2 outperforms non-FSM pupils.
Hefin David AM: But we still need to rely on the trends from a distance. If we take your argument that 2017 was an unusual year and the trends up to 2016 were positive, in a few years'time, when we will be looking back in two years'time, how are we going to measure this progress, say, in 2019? What are we likely to see and what methods are you going to use to measure progress that way?
Kirsty Williams AM: Well, you'll be aware that we are moving away from level 2 plus as a performance measure anyway because of the--
Hefin David AM: So, what performance measures will you use?
Kirsty Williams AM: So, for the lack of sophistication around the level 2 plus, and for the unintended behaviours that that particular performance measure has driven within our schools. I'll be making a statement shortly to the Assembly around a new performance measure for schools. We were, at our most recent secondary heads conference, working with schools to develop that. What's important to me is that we have a more sophisticated model that looks at school performance for all children. What level 2 plus does is narrow, very much, the focus of schools on an individual part of the cohort, usually the C/D borderline, which is why then we have problems with the number of students getting a B grade or above. We have marked success in our schools by saying to schools that a C is good enough. Well, if a child gets a C but came to you in year 7 and they were destined to get an E, yes, indeed, a C is a success, because you've moved that child on; but, if that child came to you destined to get an A* and gets a C, then we haven't done a good job by that particular child. So, we need a performance measure that is much more sophisticated, looks at each individual child, tracks that progress, and measures the value added by that school in performance.
Hefin David AM: Last question: therefore, should we have confidence in the data up to 2016? Is there a lack of confidence in that data?
Kirsty Williams AM: No, it's not a lack of confidence in the data. The data is the data. What I'm saying is, using that as a performance measure and an accountability measure within our school system may have been right for the time. I think it is now right to have a different way of measuring success in schools. I think that particular set of performance measures has driven certain behaviours--not because Ministers wanted that to happen, but as an unintended consequence. I think we can work together with our school system, learning the lessons of international best practice, to develop much more sophisticated accountability and performance measures for individual schools, and, I should say, for the Government. So, you will be aware of my intention to issue the first national report card on Government performance later on this year. So, this is not about trying to avoid scrutiny. It's about trying to develop a more sophisticated way, which is in line with our national mission, where every child's education is valued, and where the impact of the school can be tracked more effectively.
Lynne Neagle AM: Okay, thank you. Can I just ask, Cabinet Secretary, are you still holding on to your target of 37 per cent of free-school-meal pupils achieving the level 2 threshold?
Kirsty Williams AM: Well, we're moving away from the level 2 threshold. So, that's the first thing to say. So, we will want to develop a new suite, in line with our new accountability measures, as we go forward. So, we will be absolutely continuing to track and evaluate the performance of free-school-meal pupils. When we announce our new accountability measures, I will be in a position to address how we'll measure the Government's performance, and national performance, going forward. But, given the fact that we're moving away from level 2 plus, then we will need a different set of performance indicators.
Lynne Neagle AM: Okay, thank you. The next questions are on looked-after children and adopted children, and I've got questions from Michelle then Mark.
Michelle Brown AM: Thank you. Good morning--
Mark Reckless AM: I was to come in first, I think. I was about to ask about ICF consulting.
Lynne Neagle AM: Go on then.
Mark Reckless AM: I think my questions are first, but, Michelle, please do correct me if you were planning to come in before. The PDG for looked-after children doesn't quite seem to have the degree of visibility as the PDG for the free-school-meals. I think we had the MORI/WISERD survey--only 15 per cent of primary schools and 23 per cent of secondary schools were aware that PDG was targeted at looked-after children. I just wonder--can you clarify on the record here what is the role of schools with PDG for looked-after children as compared to the regional consortia in this field?
Kirsty Williams AM: Okay. I think it is absolutely fair to say that most awareness around PDG is around free school meals. There is less awareness around the availability of PDG to support looked-after children. I think that's probably in the nature of the cohort, so, there are more children subject to free school meals than are subject to being looked after. So, I think that's part of the explanation. A decision was taken in 2015 to regionalise PDG for looked-after children. My understanding was that the thinking behind that at the time was around a greater strategic deployment of that resource and to try and drive a greater impact than how it was being used previously. So, looked-after PDG is held at a regional level. We have looked-after children PDG co-ordinators--they're in their second year this year--to look at a regional deployment of that resource. And that resource can be done in a variety of ways, through individual allocation to a school to support an individual child, through to capacity building for the whole system. So, for instance, if I give you an example, in Carmarthenshire, there's been a big emphasis on attachment disorder and training teachers with regard to the impact of attachment disorder. Carmarthenshire happens to be one of those local authorities that does quite well in terms of attainment for looked-after children. But, clearly, I have--not concerns.'Concerns'isn't the right word. But I have asked officials to give greater scrutiny to how that resource has been used in the last year. Steve, on my behalf, wrote out to the system, setting out our expectations, but also advising them of the fact we will be asking very detailed questions of accountability for that money. So, what has that money been used on and how can you account for the effect? But, Steve, maybe you can give some greater detail.
Steve Davies: I think the challenge that--. One of the rationales for shifting--not that all the money stays in the region, but having a regional strategic support--was that, historically, the money was going directly with that child to the school. Given the quite often rapid turnover of children in schools--the very nature of looked-after children is they do sometimes move through foster parents--historically, what happened, the money lands in the school, because, at that time in the year, when it's measured, the school gets the money and can spend it on some additional support for staff, but quite often that child moves on to another school and the money doesn't transfer. Some schools will go through quite a number of years without having a looked-after child and will not think strategically,'How do I need to support them?'So, that was the rationale of the shift. In terms of the implementation of the regional allocation, as of this financial year finishing, we are going into local authorities and regions to evaluate where they've located the resource, what the impact of that resource has been, so that is reinforced and shared more widely.
Kirsty Williams AM: And then, to reassure, it's not just internally that we're looking at this. We have a contract with an external agency to do an evaluation--
Mark Reckless AM: That's ICF consulting.
Kirsty Williams AM: Yes. Yes, so that was done in the autumn of last year, because, as I said, we had concerns about whether this was really having the effect that was intended. So, my expectation is that we will be in a position to receive that report later on this spring, and of course it would be my intention that that report would be made public for people to have a look at what--
Mark Reckless AM: That was commissioned last autumn--
Kirsty Williams AM: Yes, in November 2017.
Mark Reckless AM: November 2017.
Kirsty Williams AM: So, I'm hoping to have that published before the summer recess. I'm very reluctant to say months; I've learnt not to say months, because they move.
Lynne Neagle AM: I'm going to go to Michelle now, Mark, because--
Mark Reckless AM: Sure. I will come back in if I have anything further to ask here after Michelle.
Lynne Neagle AM: --both of you asked for these questions, and that's what the pre-meeting is for.
Mark Reckless AM: Michelle, I defer to you.
Lynne Neagle AM: Michelle.
Michelle Brown AM: Okay, thank you. Would you be open, Cabinet Secretary, to the idea of adjusting the eligibility of the PDG so that pupils who have been looked after or adopted at any point within a previous given period of time would attract the PDG, rather than only if they're looked-after on a one-off date?
Kirsty Williams AM: As I said earlier, in questions from, I think it was, Llyr, who was talking about concepts of concepts of Ever 6, we are constantly looking at how we can get that balance between focus and flexibility for this resource. Llyr opened with the question of,'How can you absolutely ensure that these children are getting the money?', but then there's also a tension about how can you create some flexibility around the school's usage of the grant. So, we will look at that. I think there is the issue of where a school would know of a child that was looked after. Issues around adoption are slightly more sensitive, because we couldn't force a family to tell a school that their child was an adopted child. So, a family may be very open and very keen to explain that to a school, but we can't necessarily track as closely children who have been adopted, especially if that adoption happens before the child goes to school. We can't be in a position of forcing families to disclose this information if they don't want to, but we certainly can, as I say, look to strengthen our monitoring arrangements around PDG support for looked-after children and the impact that that's having. I just think we need to be a bit mindful of people's privacy in some instances. If they don't want to divulge that, it wouldn't be my job to tell a family,'You have to let us know if your child is adopted.'Lynne Neagle AM: Michelle.
Michelle Brown AM: Fair enough; thank you for that answer. The EAS consortium's approach to using the looked-after and adopted PDG is to use it as part of a broader approach targeted at vulnerable learners in general. What are your views on that approach?
Kirsty Williams AM: I'm a great believer in if we can get it right for our most vulnerable learners, we'll be getting it right for all of our learners. I gave the example earlier, for instance, of attachment disorder, and, Chair, you will know that I have had conversations. One of the emerging themes for me, as I go around visiting schools, is the impact and the growing awareness and the growing numbers of children who have attachment disorder, and how schools are best able to respond to that in their children. So, for instance, as I said about Carmarthenshire, there's been a huge effort to address that in the school sector in Carmarthenshire. Now, that has a disproportionate benefit for those children, because you're more likely to see attachment disorder in children who are care experienced, because of the nature of the lives that those children have lived, but that doesn't necessarily mean that attachment disorder is exclusively found in those children that are looked after. It can be found in other families as well. So, that vulnerable learner, regardless of their background, will benefit from having teachers who are better trained, understanding and have intervention strategies in place to be able to address that need.
Steve Davies: I think it's also important to add that this is not one region's approach; this is across four regions, so the others--. For example, ERW have run a significant programme looking at the impact of adverse childhood experiences on pupils, which has enabled teachers to detect some of the impact of some of those and then considers some of the work they need to do within the school but also with other agencies. So, it is something that's applied consistently across the four regions.
Kirsty Williams AM: I was in Pil Primary School recently where they use their PDG, both FSM PDG, and no doubt an element of PDG for looked-after, for nurture groups. So, for those children who really, really find it very difficult to be in the main classroom, they can have that nurture group experience to address issues around emotional behaviour, feelings, and it gets them in a position where they are able then to join the main classroom because issues around behaviour have been addressed and they're in a better position to learn. So, again, this is an example of how vulnerable learners in the wider sense can benefit.
Lynne Neagle AM: Okay. Mark, did you have anything you wanted to ask?
Mark Reckless AM: Yes. Can I follow up on tracking adopted children? I entirely understand that you can't force parents to disclose that their child is adopted. However, my understanding was that, in England, there was a dataset with social services that was shared with schools in a way that I'm not clear is happening in Wales and how, if at all, that links to the pupil level annual school census data. Perhaps sort of linked to that, isn't there an argument for making the parents of adopted children in the schools, potentially, with adopted children more aware that adopted children who were previously looked after have this potential grant, and would they not be more willing to disclose this, at least confidentially to the school and Government, if they knew there was this upside of doing so?
Kirsty Williams AM: We're actively looking at whether we should try and find a way of collecting this data, with the caveats that I just gave earlier. We can't force parents to divulge information that is a matter for them, nor would I want to. But there is an active discussion going on at the moment about whether we could create a dataset where people divulge this information and we can then track the children through. You're absolutely right. One of the ways in which we can often encourage take-up, for instance, of free school meals, especially in those communities where there is a sense of reluctance to apply for support--even though people are entitled to it, there's a reluctance to do it; sometimes we see this in rural areas--. Actually, appealing to the parents by saying,'Actually, this will mean more money for your child's school budget'is a much more compelling reason why people will apply for it then saying,'Actually, it's going to help you', because they don't want to be seen being dependent, they don't want to be seen being helped. But, if you say to them,'Actually, do you know that this means more money for your child's school?', they go,'Oh, all right then, I'll fill in the forms now.'So, you're right, I think there is something that we could do to make parents understand, in the round, that this has an impact. But we are actively looking at and discussing whether we could create a dataset around adopted children and how we can do that in line with data protection and data sharing. One of the things I am concerned about in the performance of looked-after children generally is how we can, across Government, work more closely together. We can't see the educational attainment of looked-after children just being a job of education. It's got to be a job of social services and the health service as well. There's got to be a joined-up approach to doing that. Now, officials were at the ministerial advisory group that's chaired by David Melding on prospects for looked-after children. They were there at the group last week. David tells me that the paper was very positively received by the group. I will be sitting down with David Melding to talk through what more we can do on the education side. I think there's really an appetite between me and the Minister for children to get a closer working relationship on this. We can't expect schools to do it on their own and alone. And there are things that we can do out there in local authorities to help improve outcomes. It's not just about the PDG; it is about, when social services are thinking about a placement, where does the discussion about where children are going to go to school--when does that take place? Do we talk about the placement, move a child and then think,'Oh my goodness me, what are we going to do about the schooling?'If you can imagine, the school could have been working really, really hard with a pupil to get them in a good place, to get them being able to access the curriculum, and then social services decide that the placement is being changed. So, we potentially lose all of that. So, a greater involvement in education and better linked-up working in local authorities will help us with this. It can't be just the job of the PDG. If we think we can crack this with just PDG, then we're being delusional. It has to be a cross-government approach at a national level, and at a local government level as well, to get this right. Sometimes, data protection--how can we break down some of these barriers between, you know, the school doesn't need to, schools shouldn't see, the entire social services report? Well, maybe the school does need to see some of that background information if they're going to have an impact for that child. So, there's more work to do, but it cannot be just the job of education on its own if we're going to make a difference, nor can it just be the job of the PDG to make a difference for those children.
Lynne Neagle AM: Thank you. Julie's got some more questions on the impact on adopted and looked-after children.
Julie Morgan AM: Yes, before I go on to those, I just wanted to support, really, what Mark was saying about adopted children and how important it is, I think, that the adoptive parents feel able to speak to the school and to give information. Because certainly any evidence we've had from adoptive parents, and generally knowing about what adoptive parents do feel, is that they often feel that there's a degree of a lack of sensitivity in the school about the issues of adoption. I would certainly support some move towards ensuring that the atmosphere was open in a way that would encourage them to realise that it would be a help for the children if there was an awareness in the school. So, I just wanted to really reinforce that.
Kirsty Williams AM: Yes, and that would chime with what I hear from many adoptive parents. I'm just trying to be sensitive by saying we can't force people to divulge this information if they don't want to.
Julie Morgan AM: No, but they need to be given the opportunity.
Kirsty Williams AM: Yes, you're right. We need to make sure that those parents feel that they can discuss this with school leaders and classroom teachers and explore how best those individual children can be supported, and how best we can support parents. Because, again--and I've said this a lot--after the quality of teaching, the second biggest impact on a child's educational outcome will be parental engagement. So, being able to create an environment where adoptive parents feel very confident and able to talk about their children's education is absolutely crucial if we're going to get that parental engagement that we need for all of our children.
Julie Morgan AM: Yes. Thank you. Going on to looked-after children, you say that the latest data on looked-after children's attainment is extremely disappointing. Can you expand on that and what effect the PDG has had in this result, or not had?
Kirsty Williams AM: Well, there's no getting away from it: the way in which we currently measure outcomes for looked-after children, the results are not good enough. It's a source of huge concern to me that we need to do better for those children. That's why officials are engaging with the group that David Melding is chairing, to make sure that education is integral to that group and it's not lost sight of. There's a discussion to be had about the cohort, whether it's right and correct to compare looked-after children to the main cohort, or whether these statistics are useful in any way. Sometimes as well--this is not to make an excuse because, as I've said in my paper, it's extremely disappointing, but sometimes it can be really difficult. Because the cohort sometimes can be very, very small, it can swing the statistics to look perhaps more dramatic.
Julie Morgan AM: I think, generally, when you look at how looked-after children do--
Kirsty Williams AM: It's not good.
Julie Morgan AM: --in a much wider evaluation, they're not doing well, are they?
Kirsty Williams AM: They're not doing well. So, that's why we've got the review, the independent review, into the impact of the PDG in this area. This is why Steve is doing the work that he is doing with the regional consortia because, clearly, at the moment, we are not doing what we need to do for that particular cohort of children. I would not make any bones about that at all.
Steve Davies: I think we will not move away from the fact that these children need good GCSEs to gain employment, so we'll continue to measure that. I think we need to look at more nuanced evaluations of the data at a lower level. So, for example, there were significant improvements in terms of PDG pupils who got three and four good GCSEs but didn't get past the threshold. That's not to cover anything that is not working in terms of improvement, but we will look at the full range and still hold on to the fact that we have to look at a measure that relates to the likelihood of these children going on to further education and training.
Julie Morgan AM: And then just one more question about the exclusion rates amongst looked-after children. They are, I understand, over six times more likely to be given a fixed-term exclusion. So, is there any way of trying to address this? Is the PDG used for anything to do with exclusions?
Kirsty Williams AM: We can look at exclusions. We also have to read across about how the whole system works, not just the PDG element of the system. So, we know, for example, that 66 per cent of looked-after learners have some additional learning need, so we can't just look at it in terms of this particular source of funding; we have to look at it at a wider level of support. So, given that the majority of those children will have an ALN, how can we make sure that our new ALN legislation and our new ALN regime meets the needs of these children? So, I think what we're looking at, again, is to say that it can't be just the job of the PDG. That's there as an additional level of support, but actually, we've got to get our ALN right. Unless we get our ALN right, lots and lots of these children are not going to get the support that they need day in, day out via that system. We do know that sometimes, if we're not addressing ALN, then we're not addressing behaviour issues that then potentially lead to an expulsion or potentially lead to non-attendance. So, we've got to look at it in the round and recognise the connections between the sometimes quite complex needs that these children have within the school setting, that are not just as a result of the fact that they're looked after; they have other needs as well.
Steve Davies: And investment in well-being--
Kirsty Williams AM: Absolutely. Steve is reminding me that that's why well-being is part of the national mission--to address issues around supporting children with their well-being, which is a way of keeping them in school.
Lynne Neagle AM: Thank you. We're going to move on to Schools Challenge Cymru now. Llyr.
Llyr Gruffydd AM: Thank you, Chair. I was just wondering what your assessment is as to why some schools made progress and others didn't.
Kirsty Williams AM: I think we have to recognise that the 39 schools that were part of the programme were in very, very different places. So, I think one of the reasons why some schools did well was because their needs were not so complex, not so deep-seated and a certain level of intervention was enough to get them moving forward. Some schools had very, very different needs. I think, talking to those involved in the programme, as always, we had some support advisers, challenge advisers working with those schools as part of the programme who were really, really excellent and really good, and were the right fit for the school and really drove the school onwards. We had other people employed in the programme who, perhaps, were less effective at driving change within those individual schools. So, what we have is a mixed bag of performance, again reflecting the very different challenges that those schools were facing, which led them to be chosen for the programme in the first place.
Llyr Gruffydd AM: Yes, okay--
Steve Davies: Sorry. One of the other key additional factors was the extent to which there had been recent appointment of a new headteacher to that school just before the programme had started, because--
Kirsty Williams AM: Leadership is all.
Llyr Gruffydd AM: And that was seen as a positive.
Steve Davies: A positive, yes. I think one of the challenges is that sometimes the time it takes to make changes in leadership can be protracted and can be a barrier, sometimes, to the speed with which you can move. But, for a significant minority of the schools, there had been recent new appointments of headteachers, which was seen to be contributing, when you looked at the evaluation, to the speed with which they were able to engage.
Llyr Gruffydd AM: The reason I was asking was I wanted to understand what lessons the Government is taking from that three-year investment, really, and how, maybe, you're applying some of those lessons to your wider school improvement programme. I know Professor Mel Ainscow identified six interconnected lessons, although I also note that the Cabinet Secretary didn't actually meet him for about six or seven months after coming into post. So, I'm just wondering, can you give us confidence that, actually, you are serious about taking lessons from Schools Challenge Cymru and applying them to the wider school improvement agenda?
Kirsty Williams AM: Well, absolutely, Llyr. I don't think anything should be read into when I met the individual concerned, because officials were meeting the individual concerned. Individual challenge advisers were meeting with the regions, there was crossover work with the FSM agenda as well, and we are absolutely determined that best practice and those interventions that drove school improvement are embedded in the new support that we have via the regional consortia. It's no coincidence that some of the best people that were employed by Schools Challenge Cymru are now in the employment of our regional consortia. So, those people that were really good and really made a difference don't work for the Schools Challenge Cymru scheme any more, they work for our regional school improvement services. So, we're absolutely determined. The things that we have learned, as always, are around leadership. It is absolutely key and crucial to have strong, capable school leadership as a driver for change within the system. We're looking at systems and processes, so, actually, has a school got in place comprehensive systems of tracking and processes within the school? We're looking at the teacher quality--how can we ensure that we have got consistent strategies in place to drive up pedagogy and teacher quality in the classroom? Collaborative activity--again, absolutely key. A school cannot see itself in isolation, and one of the key themes of the national mission is a self-improving system, so, collaborative working where schools are looking outside of each other, learning from best practice from other schools. So, there are lots of things that we've drawn from the evaluation that you will see as key themes running through the national mission, and, as I said, it's no coincidence that our really good people that were working in Schools Challenge Cymru are now working for the regional consortia, being able to use that expertise not just for a very small proportion of our schools--but that expertise is available to all our schools.
Llyr Gruffydd AM: Although Estyn has told us, of course, that you can't expect the consortia to really carry on with that level of intervention and the same kind of intensity as was provided previously, so I'm just wondering--
Kirsty Williams AM: In what way?
Llyr Gruffydd AM: Well, we were told by Estyn in evidence that they didn't necessarily think that we could expect the consortia to provide the same type of tailored support, and certainly the level of intensity with the improvement boards and everything--
Kirsty Williams AM: Well, the improvement boards are carrying on, so the improvement boards still exist, and I would--not that I want to argue with Estyn--
Llyr Gruffydd AM: Well, feel free; this is your opportunity to do so if you--
Kirsty Williams AM: What I would say is that those improvement boards are staying on, and our schools categorisation system is used to identify the level of support. Now, if you're a red school, that gives you the entitlement to 25 days of support. That is more than you would have got under the Schools Challenge Cymru programme, which would've been 20 days. So, actually, moving to this system allows us to really focus in on those schools that need that intensive level of support. And what's important for me, Llyr, in this, okay, is that those schools are not necessarily just the schools that were in the programme. Our system now of challenge, advice and support allows us to target resources across all of our schools and across all of our sectors, because you'll be aware that Schools Challenge was only available to secondary schools, not available to primary schools. What our system now allows us to do, via the schools categorisation, is to identify schools, wherever they are in Wales and whatever sector they're in, to have that intensive level of support that they need to make improvements.
Llyr Gruffydd AM: So, you're confident that that level of momentum is continuing through the consortia that was previously enjoyed by those particular schools, and you're also confident that there is minimal risk that they'll slip back to where they were, potentially, or at least part of the way back.
Kirsty Williams AM: Well, actually, there are some really good examples of some of the Schools Challenge Cymru schools making that sustained improvement now that the programme has come to an end. You only have to look at Tredegar, where we have seen continual improvement and moving up through the categorisation system. That school is now a green school, so they've been able to sustain their progress at the end of the programme. If we look at Armando in Eastern High School, again--gosh, my goodness me, we had lots of debates in a previous Chamber about the future of Eastern. There was one person that said that Eastern had to be closed and that the only way forward for that particular school was for it to be shut down, but what we have seen is investment via Schools Challenge Cymru, but ongoing, continual support from the regional consortium, and that school has come out of special measures. I pay absolute tribute to the staff of that school and that community that have done such a good job. So, I'm absolutely convinced that where we've got good leadership and good support, some of those schools are making continued, sustained progress even after the end of the programme. The challenge for me is for those schools that Schools Challenge Cymru didn't work for, and we haven't seen that progress--how we can use our school improvement system now to continue to work with those schools to give them the level of support that they need to make a difference. So that's what my focus is on now: a whole-system approach, rather than choosing 39 schools to get that level of support, when we recognise that there are schools everywhere, potentially, that need intervention, support and challenge, and in the primary sector as well.
Llyr Gruffydd AM: Okay. So, you wouldn't agree with a number of--well, the near-unanimous evidence that we've had from academics, some of whom are Government advisers from consortia et cetera, that this kind of programme such as Schools Challenge Cymru would probably need about five years to really have the impact that it was intended to have.
Kirsty Williams AM: What I would say is that, from my understanding, from the outset, it was a time-limited programme. The schools were aware of that. There were no surprises that it was supposed to be a time-limited programme. Evidence from across the UK showed that school challenge programmes have differed in time. So, for instance, Manchester's challenge was a three-year programme. So, there's no consensus about how many years you need to run a programme for. The previous Minister was quite clear about the time-limited nature of the programme. That's not to say it was the wrong decision, because what's important, and an ongoing legacy of the programme, was the investment in regional school improvement capacity, because at the time our school improvement services and the regions were young, in their infancy. The ability of individual local authorities to make a difference, with so many local authorities in an Estyn categorisation, was limited, so one of the ongoing legacies of the programme is that significant investment of over PS10 million in the capacity of the regions to be able to continue this support and the school improvement work.
Llyr Gruffydd AM: So, how disappointed were you that the money for Schools Challenge Cymru went back into reserves and didn't stay in your envelope, as you described it earlier? I presume you made a pitch for it. Did you make a case for that money to stay within your department?
Kirsty Williams AM: Llyr, we are constantly having discussions with the Minister for Finance around support for the education budget. The Minister for Finance was quite clear that it was a time-limited programme. We were able to secure investment from the Finance Minister to be able to secure the programme and run it and phase it out to make sure there was transition support, so as we moved from the schools challenge programme into the regional consortia, there were resources to do that.
Llyr Gruffydd AM: Did you feel there was a case to be made to add to the consortia's resources and be able to continue that level of support that schools had previously had?
Kirsty Williams AM: Well, we did make resources available to the regional consortia to do that. As I say, from the outset, the previous Minister was very clear it was a time-limited programme. Certainly the schools that I talk to--. And I want to be absolutely clear: I have visited many, many Schools Challenge Cymru schools. I have used that opportunity to talk to them about--Heolddu being one of them, Hefin, which we went to visit, and Willows, for instance. I'm going to one this afternoon--I'm going to St Illtyd's this afternoon, and I always take--. I've been to Caergybi in Anglesey. I always take the opportunity to speak to those teachers about their experience of the programme and to understand and assure myself that they are getting ongoing support that they see as an appropriate level for them. I think I've done 19 of the schools.
Lynne Neagle AM: Hefin on this.
Hefin David AM: With regard to it being a time-limited programme, the previous Minister was clear that it was a time-limited programme, but it wasn't quite as time-limited as you've decided to be. Is that fair to say?
Kirsty Williams AM: No, it was supposed to be a three-year programme at the most. So, there's no differential between when I decided it was time-limited and the expectations--
Hefin David AM: So the time limit was the same that the previous Minister put on it.
Kirsty Williams AM: Yes. No change.
Llyr Gruffydd AM: But Mel Ainscow did tell us that there was a fade out in that third year--not that people were giving up, don't get me wrong, but clearly there wasn't that commitment coming from Government because the decision had been made, and people felt that it was just fizzling out a little bit, and that impacted on the momentum.
Kirsty Williams AM: I wouldn't characterise it as that. I think there certainly was a transition phase when we knew that the programme was moving and schools were moving into a different level of support, but I certainly wouldn't describe it as a fading out--not at all. As I said, we were aware that the programme was transitioning and we were determined to get that right for those individual schools, and to learn the lessons and, crucially, to be able to apply those lessons right across the board.
Steve Davies: I can see where the perception would come if a programme director like Mel was managing the programme right to the end of the three years exactly the same, and it falls off--not a cliff, but it falls off, then the readiness for schools and the readiness in the system to hand over--so part of the shift of focus was that working as a Government with the programme in those schools to working with the programme, those schools and the region. So, I think, inevitably, one party might see it as a decrease in terms of emphasis on their work, but it was necessary for the transition.
Llyr Gruffydd AM: But does that cast a bit of a shadow over the transition, then--that one key player within that process felt as such, or are you confident that that was managed well and effectively?
Kirsty Williams AM: I think it was managed well, and we were very clear to recognise success where success has been achieved, but not to gloss over where the programme had not made an impact, because that wouldn't be good for anybody. There was a formal event to close the programme, which gave everybody an opportunity to get together, to be formally thanked, and for, as I said, congratulations to be given to those people who had really made a difference and, crucially, key staff transferred over into the regional consortia. So, for those individuals, they were able to continue their work, but just be able to apply that work on a regional basis rather than just in an individual school. So, I don't see that there was any fading out, but there was a transition into a new system, and many of those key personnel transitioned into the system with us.
Lynne Neagle AM: Have you got any figures for the numbers of staff who went from the programme into the consortia?
Kirsty Williams AM: Not off the top of my head, but I can let you know.
Lynne Neagle AM: Okay. I've got Darren first, then Mark.
Kirsty Williams AM: And can I just say, I met with some of them? I met with a selection of those people who had been involved in the programme to get their feedback on what they felt had gone right, and what they didn't feel had gone right in the programme. So, I took the time not just to meet the figurehead of the programme, but actually to meet the people who were doing the work in the individual schools. Sorry.
Darren Millar AM: Yes, I just wanted to ask you, you mentioned the figurehead there, I assume by'the figurehead'you mean Professor Ainscow. And you've mentioned as well that you said you wanted to learn lessons from Schools Challenge Cymru, but he told us that nobody had been in touch with him since March of last year in order to have any sort of follow-up engagement, or to have a dialogue about his perspective on what worked, what didn't work, why there were failures in some areas and why there were successes in others. Why haven't you sought that level of engagement with the person who was responsible for running the programme?
Kirsty Williams AM: I've had that conversation with Mr Ainscow. We had the evaluation of the programme. We've spoken to the people who were actually involved in running the programme on a daily basis in individual schools. We've spoken to the regional consortia. We've spoken to local education authorities. We've spoken to a wide variety of people to get their insight into the lessons learned, what was valuable and what was not valuable. So, a wide variety of people have been involved in those conversations.
Darren Millar AM: But you've hardly engaged with Mr Ainscow--with Professor Ainscow himself.
Steve Davies: I would actually say that I have had meetings--
Darren Millar AM: Since March of last year.
Steve Davies: Yes, since March of last year. I haven't got the exact dates for you. I've had discussions with Mel Ainscow, and my line manager at the time, Owen Evans, also had meetings and discussions.
Darren Millar AM: So, when he told us,'Since last March, I literally have had no contact at all with anybody from Welsh Government', he was telling porky pies, was he?
Steve Davies: That's not my recollection. I'll go back and check for you.
Lynne Neagle AM: If you could check and let us know, that would be good. Mark.
Kirsty Williams AM: Yes, well, I just talked about the celebration event to formally mark the end of the programme. My understanding was that it was July of last year, so people were engaged in that. And this idea that somebody has been ignored or frozen out is not how I see or how I regard that situation.
Lynne Neagle AM: Mark.
Mark Reckless AM: I have to say, with Professor Ainscow my impression was he took great, great pride in the work that he'd done with Schools Challenge Cymru, and I think he really enjoyed the engagement, the work and the positive relations with the Welsh Government. But I think there was just a degree of disappointment, perhaps, that at least he didn't feel that he'd been interrogated as much as he might have been about the lessons learned from the programme, and how perhaps to entrench those as well as possible with the regional consortia. I just wonder, Cabinet Secretary, if you could invite the professor in, perhaps to have a further debrief with you and take account of some of his thoughts and suggestions for what might help in this area.
Kirsty Williams AM: Well, Mark, as I said, I just don't think it should be right to characterise this as a failure to engage with a single individual.
Mark Reckless AM: I'm not characterising it that way, Cabinet Secretary.
Kirsty Williams AM: As I said, I met with him, Steve has met with him, Owen Evans has met with him, my special policy adviser has met with him and had discussions. So, there has been an ongoing dialogue. But, Mark, I hope that I have demonstrated since I took on this job that I am willing to work with a wide variety of people and to tap into their expertise if it can help me to deliver on the national mission. And if the advice to me is that we haven't sufficiently learnt the lessons, then I'll gladly have another conversation. What I'm saying to you--and I'm absolutely confident--is that we have learnt the lessons, we are taking that work and the good practice forward, and we have done that with conversations with a wide variety of people who had a view on this, from individual schools that were involved in the programme, individual people who were working in those schools, local education authorities, some of which have been very scathing about the programme, I should say, regional consortia--. So, the lessons, I am confident, have been learnt.
Mark Reckless AM: I'm glad to hear that, Cabinet Secretary, but I still say that, listening to Professor Ainscow's evidence, there was a perception, at least from him individually, that the programme should not be seen to be a failure, but a desire that the lessons should be learnt and a feeling or exception, at least on his part, that there was more that he still had to contribute to the process. And just to take one particular example, I think he referred to the Schools Challenge Cymru advisers being very successful in bringing in people who might not otherwise have contributed to this, and the regional consortia have had greater challenges in recruiting people, perhaps in some areas, of the same high standard of some particular individuals, but also from a wide range of different areas that the Schools Challenge Cymru do, and that there could be more to learn in that area as to how to support real excellence and a greater diversity of recruitment for those people. Is that something you could perhaps draw on his thoughts further about? Because I think he does feel that he has more to say to Welsh Government to help in this area.
Kirsty Williams AM: Firstly, can I say that I have never described the programme as a failure? I would understand, as someone who has put so much personal investment into the brand of schools challenges, that he would not want anybody to characterise that particular approach to school improvement as a failure. And I want to be absolutely clear that I have never described the programme as a failure, and I want to reassure Mr Ainscow of that. As I've said, gosh, my goodness me, if you saw my e-mail inbox and you saw the letters that come in, people are never shy in coming forward to give me advice on what I need to do, what I need to do next, what I'm doing right, what I'm doing wrong, and, you know, our doors are always open to listen to people who have interesting things to say about how we can deliver our educational mission. So, people aren't slow in coming forward, I can assure you, with advice.
Lynne Neagle AM: Julie.
Julie Morgan AM: Just very quickly. I'm sure the Minister is aware that Cardiff put extra funds of its own in to continue Schools Challenge Cymru advisers. So, obviously, they appreciated the value of the scheme, but it does query whether it should have gone on longer.
Kirsty Williams AM: Julie, I think, to be fair, there are some people who think the scheme was absolutely fantastic. I've had feedback from people who didn't think the scheme was helpful at all--in fact, they felt it was a hindrance. I'm very much of the view that the scheme worked really well for some schools in some areas and had less impact in some areas. There is a mixed picture. What's important to me is that we understand what it was that led those schools to make those big changes, how we can--like Mark talked about, the expertise--how we can keep that expertise in the system, and how we can apply the lessons to all schools.
Lynne Neagle AM: The next questions, and the final questions, are from John. So, we're going to need succinct questions and succinct answers.
John Griffiths AM: Some questions on regional consortia, Cabinet Secretary, and, first of all, the role that you believe they should play and how schools use PDG.
Kirsty Williams AM: Well, it's an absolute--. It's one of the things that I have been very clear to the regional consortia that I expect their challenge and support advisers to be asking schools about. So, one of the conversations that they need to have when they are in schools is exploring, with that school, how they are using their PDG, and how they're demonstrating an impact for those resources. So, it's a fundamental role for the challenge and support advisers in the regional consortia in their school improvement work. It's crucial.
John Griffiths AM: That sort of brings to mind some of the research that's been done on the role of the challenge advisers, Cabinet Secretary, which suggested that they're not actually challenging schools in that way, and that there's very little evidence of schools changing their decisions on the use of PDG as a result of any challenge from those challenge advisers. So, how would you respond to those findings?
Kirsty Williams AM: Well, as I said, in my scrutiny of the role and success of our regional consortia, I specifically asked them about free-school-meal performance and the use of PDG within their particular region. I think there is increasing evidence to suggest that good use is being made of that resource, and I think that is being fed back into us. Estyn tell us that it's one of the areas of school expenditure that is closely linked to research and an evidence base. But, clearly, there is more to do, and that's why we have appointed the new regional advisers for PDG going forward, because we think there can be improvements in how this agenda can be supported at a regional level.
John Griffiths AM: Okay. So, you would recognise the findings from that research.
Kirsty Williams AM: Yes. There's always more that we can do, and we are strengthening that role by the appointment of the new regional PDG advisers, so that individual school challenge advisers know what they should be looking for, know what they should be doing, and there is a regional approach to good practice.
John Griffiths AM: Okay. Could you tell the committee, Cabinet Secretary, how effective you believe the relationship was between the Schools Challenge Cymru programme and the regional consortia's school improvement functions, and to what extent it varied by region?
Kirsty Williams AM: I think it's fair to say that, on occasion, I have received feedback that there was a conflict between what was going on at an individual school under the school improvement programme and whether, then, they welcomed support from the regional consortia as part of that. So, in some cases, if we're being absolutely honest, there could sometimes be tensions between the two, but in most cases, the relationship was very, very positive and there was continuous feedback between the work going on in the schools under the programme and the regional consortia challenge advisers. But I'm going to be blunt and honest with people--in some cases, it has been reported to me--it's only anecdotal evidence; I haven't got hard and fast evidence--that there sometimes was a conflict:'We're a school challenge school so we don't need to participate or listen to any advice that's coming from the regional consortia.'Or, a local education authority said to me,'We felt that we couldn't get involved in that school anymore because it was part of a different programme.'Those were isolated incidents, and, as I said, it's only anecdotal feedback. In most cases, the relationship was a very positive one.
Steve Davies: Just very quickly, I think that, across the board, it was more complex in the beginning, getting--[Inaudible. ]. But when the programme itself recognised that they needed to work with the regions, and the regions needed to work with them--and I think Mel Ainscow in his evidence referred to this--it strengthened after some early challenges. I think Mel Ainscow was working in a number of regions--I can't remember which ones--so he's established relationships--[Interruption. ] Sorry?
Kirsty Williams AM: Central south.
Steve Davies: Central south. He has already been working in that, so I think it possibly had a stronger springboard in terms of the early working.
Kirsty Williams AM: Because he already had relationships that he had already developed in that particular region. As always, with many of these things, it's about individuals and relationships.
John Griffiths AM: Okay. Finally from me, Cabinet Secretary: in 2015-16, Estyn reported on regional consortia not sufficiently focusing on particular groups of pupils and tracking their outcomes--for example, vulnerable pupils. I just wonder what you are able to tell us in terms of to what extent there has been necessary progress since 2015-16.
Kirsty Williams AM: Okay. Well, I think it's important to recognise that all four consortia underwent monitoring visits in the autumn of last year, of 2017, which weren't reflected in the Estyn annual report for 2015-16. Estyn, through these 2017 inspections, have said that three out of the four regional consortia are making strong progress in their particular work, and we are continuing, as Welsh Government, to work with the other regional consortia to address the findings of the Estyn report.
John Griffiths AM: And that would include these particular issues.
Kirsty Williams AM: Yes, absolutely. The committee probably hasn't had an opportunity to see, but, only this morning, Estyn has released a report on more able and talented, and has positive things to say in the field of more able and talented, which was being asked about earlier by Members--you know, evidence of improved working and support in that particular arena. But, again, we need to ensure a consistency across all the regions, and that the findings of Estyn's most recent reports into regional performance are followed through.
Lynne Neagle AM: Okay, thank you. As we've got a couple of minutes left, if I can just jump back to the issue of practical uses of the PDG--because it's the only thing we haven't really covered and it would be good to get on the record--can I ask to what extent you'd like to see the PDG used to track the progress of eligible pupils? And the committee's heard that there are several different tracking systems and tools used by schools. To what extent is that an issue to do with what the Welsh Government is promoting? Or is it down to consortia or individual schools? And do you think there needs to be a more centralised push on how the tracking is undertaken?
Kirsty Williams AM: Firstly, can I say it's absolutely crucial that we track performance, absolutely crucial? That's the bedrock. We don't dictate to individual schools the nature of the system that they should employ in their school. There are a number of different programmes that allow schools to do this, but we are absolutely clear, and best practice and evidence shows us, that individual pupil tracking is key and crucial. And, as I said in the beginning, where we weren't tracking pupils at all, initial investment in PDG was used to establish these systems within schools. Again, one of the outcomes from the schools challenge review, and one of the lessons learnt, was, again, the importance of individual tracking of pupils throughout their school career. But we don't dictate a single system.
Lynne Neagle AM: Okay, thank you.
Kirsty Williams AM: But the principle is a really important one.
Lynne Neagle AM: Okay, and you don't think there's more scope to look at what the best system is that can be recommended to schools.
Kirsty Williams AM: That's not something we're actively looking at. I am actively looking at developing a Welsh toolkit around good practice, evidence base and research. At the moment we use the Sutton Trust toolkit, which is fine and excellent, but we are having active discussions about whether we're in a position, now, to look at developing a suite of a Welsh toolkit to support this agenda, and that's under active consideration.
Lynne Neagle AM: Okay. Well, we've reached the end of our session. Can I thank the Cabinet Secretary and the officials for attending and for answering such a wide range of questions? As usual, you'll be sent a transcript to check for accuracy following the meeting, but thank you again for coming.
Kirsty Williams AM: Thank you very much.
Lynne Neagle AM: Thank you. Okay. Item 3, then, is papers to note. Paper to note 1 is a letter from the Minister for Children and Social Care on Families First funding. Paper to note 2 is a letter from the Cabinet Secretary for Education, updating us on the supply teacher issue. Paper to note 3--another letter from the Cabinet Secretary for Education, providing further information following our meeting on 15 February. Paper to note 4 is a letter from the WJEC on availability of textbooks. Paper to note 5--a letter from Qualifications Wales, also on availability of textbooks. And paper to note 6 is a letter from the Cabinet Secretary for Education to the Children's Commissioner for Wales, following up on the dialogue that they've been having about our inquiry. Are Members happy to note those? Thank you. Item 4, then, is for me to propose, in accordance with Standing Order 17. 42, that the committee resolves to meet in private for the remainder of the meeting. Are Members content? Thank you.","According to Kirsty Williams, it's probably the best that they've got at present, and will continue to have discussions with local government about whether there are different ways. Officials are working all the time in conjunction with the department in England, to understand their thinking in this area so that we are in a position to make some decisions about what a notional eligibility for free school meals will look like going forward, but before I make any decisions, I want to assure everybody that there will be a full public consultation on that.",qmsum
"How do the group think of the extent and condition that schools actually make good use of that funding of PDG?
Lynne Neagle AM: Good morning, everyone, and welcome to this morning's Children, Young People and Education Committee. We've received no apologies for absence. Can I ask Members who are present if they wish to declare any interests? Okay, thank you. Item 2 this morning is our final evidence session for our inquiry into targeted funding to improve educational outcomes. I'm very pleased to welcome Kirsty Williams AM, Cabinet Secretary for Education; Steve Davies, director of the education directorate; and Ruth Conway, deputy director, support for learners division. Welcome to all of you, and thank you for your attendance and also for the paper that you've provided in advance. If you're happy, we'll go straight into questions, and the first questions are from Llyr Gruffydd.
Llyr Gruffydd AM: Bore da. I just want to start by asking some questions around the targeting of the pupil development grant because, clearly, we've had a lot of evidence around this apparent blurring of eligibility to an extent. I'm just wondering how comfortable you are that the money is being targeted appropriately because, clearly, it's being targeted more widely than just those eligible for free school meals, from some of the evidence we've had, but also that it seems to be predominantly focused on low-attaining frees--pupils who are eligible for free school meals.
Kirsty Williams AM: Thank you, Llyr. I think it's important to be absolutely clear that when it comes to individual interventions, those individual interventions should only be targeted at those children who are eligible for free school meals. But in some cases, schools may use their PDG funding to provide a universal intervention, but we would want to--in challenge advisers'discussions in schools--we'd want to have evidence that that universal intervention would have a disproportionate effect on the outcomes for children on free school meals. So, for instance, if I give you an example in your own region, Llyr: at Brynteg County Primary School in Wrexham, if you look at that primary school in Wrexham, their results for free-school-meal children at the end of their primary school period in school are equivalent to their non-free-school-meal counterparts. So, there is no differentiation in those results. One of the things that they've used their PDG for is to really focus on the concept of growth mindset in school. So, that's a universal thing that they've trained all the teachers in, but what we know is that that has a disproportionate effect on those children who are on free school meals. So, if you're familiar with the concept of a growth mindset, it's about really challenging learners to think that,'I can do things. If sometimes I fail, I pick myself up, I'm more resilient.'Now, that has been, as I said, trained to all the teachers in the school--it's an ethos for the whole school--but we have seen that the impact on the free-school-meal children has been even greater, and now they're at the same level. So, that's the important distinction. Individual intervention per child has to be targeted at those children who are eligible for free school meals, but sometimes a school will employ a whole-school approach to train their staff, for instance, and that, then, has to demonstrate it has a disproportionate effect on free school meals. So, growth mindset; it may be attachment disorder training for staff, for instance, where we know it's of benefit to everybody, but will have particular benefits for that cohort of students. With regard to more able and talented, you know, Llyr, that this is an area of concern for me, generally, within the Welsh education system; that we've not been particularly good at identifying, supporting and driving attainment for those children. I'm absolutely clear that PDG needs to be used for those children who are eligible to drive potential, whatever the potential of that child is, including more able and talented. And again, I'll give you an example that has been seen as good practice in Pembrokeshire: a window on the world bus, again paid for by schools. I don't know if you're aware of it.
Llyr Gruffydd AM: We've heard about that.
Kirsty Williams AM: Oh, you've heard about it; well, it's a really good example the window on the world. And, again, that's very much targeted at raising aspirations and giving children who are more able and talented, who are eligible for PDG, those experiences, and to really push them. So, yes, I'm absolutely clear that PDG shouldn't just be seen to be getting individuals to the average. For those children who are more able and talented, it should be used to support them--
Llyr Gruffydd AM: And we all share those aspirations, I'm sure, and you pointed to examples of good practice, but of course, it's not universal, is it, so what I'm asking is: do you think that the guidance is sufficient as it is? Do you think that there's a great enough awareness of how the PDG should be used at the coalface? And also, are you confident that consortia and others have the measures in place to be able to demonstrate that it is being used properly?
Kirsty Williams AM: I think, if we look at what Estyn has said about PDG, it does actually recognise that the PDG is being used to push more able and talented children, but as always with the system, Llyr, it's whether we can be sure that that is strategic and that it's happening across all of our schools. So, you're--
Llyr Gruffydd AM: But not just in relation to more able and talented, I'm referring to the eligibility and the targeting.
Kirsty Williams AM: Oh, the eligibility. You'll be aware that, on the advice of Sir Alasdair, we have employed and appointed new PDG regional advisers, and I think their role is going to be absolutely crucial in spreading that good practice across the region, whether that's use of PDG for more able and talented, or ensuring that PDG is used in the appropriate way. So, that's there to provide strategic overall advice. And obviously, we have been very clear with regional challenge advisers, in the relationship and the conversations they're having with individual schools, that they're really challenging their schools about the use of PDG, not just in terms of targeting, but the programmes, what the money is being spent on, whether there is an evidence base for that and whether we are clear on impact. So, I think the new regional advisers are going to be crucial in enabling us to ensure more consistent practice across the regions.
Llyr Gruffydd AM: So, are you content that eligibility for free school meals is the best measure, really, of identifying which pupils to target?
Kirsty Williams AM: Llyr, in the absence of anything better. I'll be the first person to say that maybe it's not as absolutely focused, but in the absence of anything different to identify a proxy for need, I think it's probably the best that we've got at present. And we will continue to have discussions with local government about whether there are different ways. We have to be mindful. Some of the policy levers in this area are out of my hands, so if we look at the roll-out of universal credit, for instance, we've got officials working very hard at the moment to try and understand what universal credit is going to mean and where we are going to be able to identify relative need, going forward. We haven't had any additional resource as a result of this, but we're very mindful that, potentially, this has an impact, going forward. And, officials are working all of the time, I must say, in conjunction with the department in England, to understand their thinking in this area so that we are in a position to make some decisions about what a notional eligibility for free school meals will look like going forward, but before I make any decisions, I want to assure everybody that there will be a full public consultation on that.
Llyr Gruffydd AM: Okay. Finally for now, on this issue of once a year, in January, if you're eligible for free school meals, then you're in that group for that year. We've had some quite strong evidence about how difficult that makes longer term planning for a number of schools and we've also been pointed in the direction of what's happened in England with the Ever 6, and I'm just wondering whether you're giving any thought to maybe changing that a little bit.
Kirsty Williams AM: Well, we're certainly giving thought to flexibility. In conversations with Alasdair, who is our independent adviser on this agenda, and individual schools, we're actively giving thought to greater flexibility and maybe longer term projections, so that schools know, for a number of years ahead, what their allocation will be. There are advantages to that system, because you could give that flexibility, you could give that long-term approach, but then, how do you make that responsive if a school suddenly has more children? We do know that, actually, the number of free-school-meal pupils is dropping. But there can be changes, you know, regional working in areas of north Wales in tourism, or maybe in other areas at Christmas time, parents are able to get a period of work. So, how can we create a more flexible system? We're actively looking at that at the moment. I wouldn't use it as an Ever 6 concept, but as an'Ever 2'concept. We have looked at Ever 6, and I'm going to be absolutely blunt with you: to introduce an Ever 6 concept for Wales would mean in the region of identifying an additional PS40 million. I'm going to be absolutely straight and blunt with you: we're not in a position at the moment to be able to identify an additional PS40 million to introduce an Ever 6. But issues around flexibility, certainly, are actively under consideration. In fact, we'll be having a discussion later on today about decisions, going forward, for the next two years.
Llyr Gruffydd AM: Thank you.
Lynne Neagle AM: Darren on this.
Darren Millar AM: It's just a very brief point in response to the PS40 million price ticket that you just put on that. That's, of course, assuming that you maintain the current level of PDG, yes? So, if you reduced the level of PDG slightly, but made it available to more individuals, if you like, via allocating it in a different way, then that PS40 million price ticket wouldn't be there, would it?
Kirsty Williams AM: I was asked a question about had I ever considered an Ever 6. We have looked at that, we've priced that up. I have to make decisions in the envelope of resources that are available to me. We could, indeed, change the way in which we allocate PDG money, but we have to do it within the envelope that is available to me, over PS90 million. That's a significant level of investment, but, of course, as always, Darren, we could cut the amount per pupil, but that might have quite challenging swings in allocations. What we have done--because what I am clear on is that there was evidence to suggest that in the secondary sector, a great deal of PDG was being focused on years 10 and 11, especially year 11, in catch-up provision, and you'll be aware, because we've said this in evidence to the committee in the papers, we've set a challenge to secondary schools to say,'Actually, the majority of your PDG allocation has to be used in key stage 3.'Now, we have to balance the needs, the moral hazard of turning round to children in years 10 and 11 and saying,'We're not going to provide catch-up opportunities for you,'because, clearly, those children need that support. But the evidence and the advice that we're receiving is: actually, strong focus on early years, primary and key stage 3, if we get that right, should negate the need for spending money on catch-up at years 10 and 11. That's why we, in our advice to local authorities and schools, say that we want to see evidence that they're spending this money earlier on in a child's career, rather than just a scramble at year 11 to say,'Right, we've got to get you through your exams.'Darren Millar AM: Okay, but have you actively considered, then, reducing the level you have?
Kirsty Williams AM: We've--
Ruth Conway: Sorry--I was just going to say that one of the things is looking at the scope of the definition, and I think it's about being more flexible with the definition, rather than reducing the amount per head.
Darren Millar AM: Okay. Thank you.
Lynne Neagle AM: Thank you. If we can go on, then, to talk about some of the practical uses of the PDG, you write in your written paper that'the majority of schools are making well thought out and appropriate decisions'on how to use it. But Estyn reported that only two thirds of primary and secondary schools make effective use of the PDG. Given that we've had it now for six years, would you not have expected there to be a higher level of schools actually making good use of that funding?
Kirsty Williams AM: Well, to flip it on its head, the vast majority of schools, as identified by Estyn, are using this money to good effect. So, that's the way I like to see it--that the vast majority of schools are doing well. What Estyn has also indicated is the intrinsic link here to leadership within individual schools, and as you'll be aware, leadership, improving capacity in leadership and developing leadership talent in the Welsh education system is a key priority for me in our national mission. Of course, that's being developed in a different work stream. I think what's fair to say is that the use of PDG is evolving over time. I think we are seeing, increasingly, more and more schools understanding how best to deploy that money for best effect for students. So, if we're honest, when PDG first started, I think, in some schools it was spent on investing in tracking of children, because they'd never thought about tracking these children, they didn't have systems in place to look at the performance of these children, and to have a system in place. So we've moved now from spending money on the infrastructure around support for FSM children into actual inputs in terms of teaching and learning. We're also seeing from Estyn that, actually, in terms of money following the evidence of what we know works, Estyn says that PDG is probably the best example of schools following tried and tested and evidence-based interventions to deploy the money. But clearly we want all of this money to be deployed as well as it can be, and again we come back to the decision I've made to appoint regional PDG advisers so that we can get that better consistency of approach. We are, in the discussions that I have with the regional consortia about how they challenge individual schools on usage, looking for very clear evidence of schools using the Sutton Trust toolkit, and we could have a discussion about whether that's the right thing, because that's on my mind too. But we want to see schools demonstrating their evidence base, and if they're not, if a school isn't doing that, okay, so demonstrate to us why you've made those decisions and, crucially, what are you doing as the school to judge whether that decision is actually making a difference for your individual pupils. So, if you're moving away from tried and tested interventions, what we know works, if you're doing something different with your money, okay, you need to justify that and you need to explain how you're going to demonstrate impact. But I think what we're seeing is increasing good practice in this area as the PDG develops and as our understanding of our school-to-school working in our self-improving school system also develops. I think we're seeing better usage of the money year on year.
Lynne Neagle AM: Thank you. Llyr on this.
Llyr Gruffydd AM: You mentioned some schools will be moving from the tried-and-tested interventions, really, and I'm just wondering to what extent that evolution of use of PDG is being driven by cuts to core funding.
Kirsty Williams AM: No, I don't think it's being driven by cuts to core funding. I think there has been--. One of the biggest impacts of PDG has not been--well, I suppose it is the money in itself, because the money has concentrated the minds, hasn't it? So, one of the most important things that PDG has done is highlight the importance of this agenda within schools, and really raise this up in the thinking of leadership and senior management teams in our schools, and has driven a focus on scrutiny and accountability in the systems that are working with our schools. I think the changing use of PDG reflects the journeys that schools have been on, some of them from a very low base where this was not a priority for them, to better understanding, and as research and as intelligence grows over time in this area, both in Wales and outside of Wales, schools are increasingly learning to use that evidence to tailor approaches in their schools.
Llyr Gruffydd AM: So you wouldn't accept at all that some of this money's being used to paper over some funding cracks from elsewhere. Because the unions and some others have told us that, whether we like it or not, there is some of that going on.
Kirsty Williams AM: As I said, Llyr, we're very clear about the usage that this money can be spent on in terms of individuals or universal application within schools, and that forms an important part of the checks and balances that we have in our system. Can we continue to improve, and ensure that more and more of our schools are employing best practice? Yes, we can, and as I've said, we've taken steps to put in place the infrastructure to support that.
Lynne Neagle AM: Thank you. Mark's questions are next.
Mark Reckless AM: Cabinet Secretary, how would you assess the impact of PDG on attendance and hopefully subsequent engagement with education from children who have free school meals?
Kirsty Williams AM: I think what's important to note is that, as Estyn have themselves said, over the period of the last inspection report, we have seen improvements in attendance, but I do think we need to, again, look at how PDG can support this particular agenda. And as always in the Welsh education system, there are some excellent examples of how schools use the money to address this. Ysgol y Preseli in Pembrokeshire is a very good example of how they've deployed their money. Forgive me; I can't off the top of my head remember the name of the primary school I visited, again in north Wales, where the school has proactively used this money, and they actually send teaching assistants out of school in the morning before the start of the school day, and they actually have a walking bus. They call at homes for children, and they walk the children to the breakfast club. So, they're proactively going out into the community and making sure that those children are in the classrooms, because the teacher said,'We recognised we had a problem with attendance. We tried a variety of means of improving that, but in the end we have taken this quite bold step--we actually send the staff out and they create that walking bus, and they walk the children into school'. They say that they know that, for some of those children, because of the difficult circumstances they and their families are living in, they probably wouldn't be in school if it wasn't for that proactive approach. So, we're looking again at what more we can do to support this particular agenda in terms of improving attendance, because although, again, there are examples of good practice, there is still a gap between the attendance of free-school-meal pupils and non-free-school-meal pupils. And, of course, we can have the best curriculum in the world with really high-quality teaching, but unless the children are in the classes then we're not going to make the difference for them. Whilst that differential exists, then it's going to be hard to close the attainment gap for those children.
Mark Reckless AM: I was actually quite shocked just reading in advance of this meeting that the proportion attending 95 per cent or more, who have pretty full attendance, was only 35 per cent for free-school-meal children at level 4, compared to 60 per cent for non-free-school-meal pupils. It still is an extraordinary difference. My colleague here showed me, I think, last week, a graph showing the link between attendance and attainment, in particular. When people were absent, a lot of the--. As I'm sure you're aware, there's a huge connection. What more can PDG do to deal with it? In the example you give I can see how a school with an awful lot of free-school-meal children could do that, but a lot of the free-school-meal children are actually in schools that don't have that high a proportion of free school meals, where it would be much more challenging to bring in that type of initiative.
Kirsty Williams AM: Yes, indeed, and I think it gets more challenging the older the children get. I think it's more difficult to find interventions that are successful higher up, so key stage 4. So, you can do a walking bus with little ones, can't you, but I don't suppose your average 15 or 16-year-old is going to take very kindly to that. So, you do need a different approach to that. But again, we see in Ysgol y Preseli the employment of staff to directly work with families of older children to reinforce the messages around, as you quite rightly say, the linkage between attendance and attainment, and really work with individual families to understand the barriers to attendance: what's going on in the family that is preventing that child from going to school, and what more can the school do to address those situations. But you're absolutely right; there is more that we need to do to address this particular agenda of attainment. I don't know if there's anything extra you wanted to add, Steve.
Steve Davies: There is also another very good example--and I take what you say about where there are small numbers--but in our secondary schools where there are significant numbers, they're investing PDG in resources like a school nurse and a school counsellor, not just to work with the children but link to other agencies on whom the children and the families are dependent to support them in terms of working with schools. So, it's something, particularly in our most challenging areas, where it cannot just be delivered within the school. So, good use of that resource is being made to employ people to support them in those wider areas.
Mark Reckless AM: Thank you. To what extent is PDG also used to seek to reduce the higher rates of exclusion for children entitled to free school meals?
Kirsty Williams AM: So, if we looked at permanent exclusions, there isn't a differential, but if we look at temporary exclusions, there we see there is a disproportionate number of children on free school meals that are subject to those exclusions. Again, I think what schools employing best practice understand is that you need a multi-agency approach to supporting that particular child. Some of those exclusions can be as a result of the need to address other issues going on in a child's life. So, this is where we come back to the committee's work, for instance, on mental health and support for children, support for behaviour in school. So, again, it's a multi-agency approach that I think we need, and, in our good schools, our really, really good schools, there's a recognition of that need to have a whole team around a child to support that child in education. With EOTAS, we made some changes last year regarding PDG for EOTAS. So, for those children who do find themselves in education other than at school, we are providing additional support that previously was not available.
Mark Reckless AM: Thank you.
Lynne Neagle AM: Okay. We're going to move on now to talk about the impact of PDG on attainment. Hefin David has got some questions.
Hefin David AM: It appears that the attainment gap at 2017 has actually widened, in spite of PDG levels. Is that correct?
Kirsty Williams AM: Yes. So, if you look at it--with the usual caveats about whether you can make direct comparisons on level 2 plus between the exams the year before and the exams that we had last summer--on the face of it, the gap has increased. I think what's important to recognise, Hefin, is a direction of travel. I'm sure we all want to, because I want to, have a discussion about why children on free school meals were less resilient in the exam system last year. But, if we look at the period that we have been employing PDG, over that period, we have seen a narrowing of the gap. I think what's quite stark, if we think about it--. So, if we look at where we started from: in 2009, one in five children on free school meals got level 2 plus--one in five--by 2016, we had got that down to one in three. Obviously, there's still a way to go, but, Sir Alasdair, who knows about these things, says that that is a significant improvement. Last year, we got some challenges. We need to understand why that happened, but I do think it's--
Hefin David AM: Why, do you think?
Kirsty Williams AM: Why, do I think? What I do think is there is no one answer. There is no one answer to this. I think we could look at and we can have discussions around the move from BTEC to science GCSEs. I think we have supplied figures to the committee about the significant change in the number of children on free school meals who weren't doing a single science GCSE and are now doing science GCSEs. We can look at the unintended consequences of literature. Again, we've supplied figures. Where children have done language and literature, whether that be through the medium of English or through the medium of Welsh, there is more resilience. So, it's that exposure to literacy in all its forms that I think could potentially make a difference. So, I think there's no one answer to why free-school-meal children were not so resilient last year. We continue to have discussions with Qualifications Wales to get a better understanding of this. At my next ministerial policy board, in May, we'll be doing a deep dive into this particular subject.
Hefin David AM: So, to what extent would exam boards be responsible for lack of grade stability?
Kirsty Williams AM: It could be one of the contributory factors. What I think is important is that there is no one, single reason why there seems to be less resilience in this cohort of children.
Hefin David AM: Will you be speaking to the exam boards about this and raising concerns?
Kirsty Williams AM: I have written to Qualifications Wales, we've had discussions about it, but I've asked them to formally submit evidence ahead of my policy board for May, where, as I said, we will be doing a formal, deep-dive discussion across the department about these issues. But, again, Hefin, what we've got to be clear on is--while we look at overall factors, you know, our overall national statistic--we did see some schools last year whose FSM performance was better than it had been the year before. So, what was it in those schools that enabled those children to do really well, whereas, in other schools, the performance was different? Even in individual cities, you can see a huge variety of performance. So, take Cardiff and Swansea, our two biggest cities. You've got schools in those cities with comparative levels of free school meals. So, you could have really high-performing schools with a very small number of the cohort on free school meals. The difference between those performances in a single city--so, that's the same local education authority and the same regional consortium--you can see a massive change. There's one school I can talk to: their free-school-meal performance is 88 per cent. A similar school in the same city with the same proportion of children on free school meals, their performance is down in the 20 per cents. So, I think what's important is that we can't draw broad-brush conclusions. For me, the challenge is to go into individual schools and understand what was happening in that particular school that ensured that their children did really well. We've got one school in Swansea, their FSM performance at GCSE level 2 outperforms non-FSM pupils.
Hefin David AM: But we still need to rely on the trends from a distance. If we take your argument that 2017 was an unusual year and the trends up to 2016 were positive, in a few years'time, when we will be looking back in two years'time, how are we going to measure this progress, say, in 2019? What are we likely to see and what methods are you going to use to measure progress that way?
Kirsty Williams AM: Well, you'll be aware that we are moving away from level 2 plus as a performance measure anyway because of the--
Hefin David AM: So, what performance measures will you use?
Kirsty Williams AM: So, for the lack of sophistication around the level 2 plus, and for the unintended behaviours that that particular performance measure has driven within our schools. I'll be making a statement shortly to the Assembly around a new performance measure for schools. We were, at our most recent secondary heads conference, working with schools to develop that. What's important to me is that we have a more sophisticated model that looks at school performance for all children. What level 2 plus does is narrow, very much, the focus of schools on an individual part of the cohort, usually the C/D borderline, which is why then we have problems with the number of students getting a B grade or above. We have marked success in our schools by saying to schools that a C is good enough. Well, if a child gets a C but came to you in year 7 and they were destined to get an E, yes, indeed, a C is a success, because you've moved that child on; but, if that child came to you destined to get an A* and gets a C, then we haven't done a good job by that particular child. So, we need a performance measure that is much more sophisticated, looks at each individual child, tracks that progress, and measures the value added by that school in performance.
Hefin David AM: Last question: therefore, should we have confidence in the data up to 2016? Is there a lack of confidence in that data?
Kirsty Williams AM: No, it's not a lack of confidence in the data. The data is the data. What I'm saying is, using that as a performance measure and an accountability measure within our school system may have been right for the time. I think it is now right to have a different way of measuring success in schools. I think that particular set of performance measures has driven certain behaviours--not because Ministers wanted that to happen, but as an unintended consequence. I think we can work together with our school system, learning the lessons of international best practice, to develop much more sophisticated accountability and performance measures for individual schools, and, I should say, for the Government. So, you will be aware of my intention to issue the first national report card on Government performance later on this year. So, this is not about trying to avoid scrutiny. It's about trying to develop a more sophisticated way, which is in line with our national mission, where every child's education is valued, and where the impact of the school can be tracked more effectively.
Lynne Neagle AM: Okay, thank you. Can I just ask, Cabinet Secretary, are you still holding on to your target of 37 per cent of free-school-meal pupils achieving the level 2 threshold?
Kirsty Williams AM: Well, we're moving away from the level 2 threshold. So, that's the first thing to say. So, we will want to develop a new suite, in line with our new accountability measures, as we go forward. So, we will be absolutely continuing to track and evaluate the performance of free-school-meal pupils. When we announce our new accountability measures, I will be in a position to address how we'll measure the Government's performance, and national performance, going forward. But, given the fact that we're moving away from level 2 plus, then we will need a different set of performance indicators.
Lynne Neagle AM: Okay, thank you. The next questions are on looked-after children and adopted children, and I've got questions from Michelle then Mark.
Michelle Brown AM: Thank you. Good morning--
Mark Reckless AM: I was to come in first, I think. I was about to ask about ICF consulting.
Lynne Neagle AM: Go on then.
Mark Reckless AM: I think my questions are first, but, Michelle, please do correct me if you were planning to come in before. The PDG for looked-after children doesn't quite seem to have the degree of visibility as the PDG for the free-school-meals. I think we had the MORI/WISERD survey--only 15 per cent of primary schools and 23 per cent of secondary schools were aware that PDG was targeted at looked-after children. I just wonder--can you clarify on the record here what is the role of schools with PDG for looked-after children as compared to the regional consortia in this field?
Kirsty Williams AM: Okay. I think it is absolutely fair to say that most awareness around PDG is around free school meals. There is less awareness around the availability of PDG to support looked-after children. I think that's probably in the nature of the cohort, so, there are more children subject to free school meals than are subject to being looked after. So, I think that's part of the explanation. A decision was taken in 2015 to regionalise PDG for looked-after children. My understanding was that the thinking behind that at the time was around a greater strategic deployment of that resource and to try and drive a greater impact than how it was being used previously. So, looked-after PDG is held at a regional level. We have looked-after children PDG co-ordinators--they're in their second year this year--to look at a regional deployment of that resource. And that resource can be done in a variety of ways, through individual allocation to a school to support an individual child, through to capacity building for the whole system. So, for instance, if I give you an example, in Carmarthenshire, there's been a big emphasis on attachment disorder and training teachers with regard to the impact of attachment disorder. Carmarthenshire happens to be one of those local authorities that does quite well in terms of attainment for looked-after children. But, clearly, I have--not concerns.'Concerns'isn't the right word. But I have asked officials to give greater scrutiny to how that resource has been used in the last year. Steve, on my behalf, wrote out to the system, setting out our expectations, but also advising them of the fact we will be asking very detailed questions of accountability for that money. So, what has that money been used on and how can you account for the effect? But, Steve, maybe you can give some greater detail.
Steve Davies: I think the challenge that--. One of the rationales for shifting--not that all the money stays in the region, but having a regional strategic support--was that, historically, the money was going directly with that child to the school. Given the quite often rapid turnover of children in schools--the very nature of looked-after children is they do sometimes move through foster parents--historically, what happened, the money lands in the school, because, at that time in the year, when it's measured, the school gets the money and can spend it on some additional support for staff, but quite often that child moves on to another school and the money doesn't transfer. Some schools will go through quite a number of years without having a looked-after child and will not think strategically,'How do I need to support them?'So, that was the rationale of the shift. In terms of the implementation of the regional allocation, as of this financial year finishing, we are going into local authorities and regions to evaluate where they've located the resource, what the impact of that resource has been, so that is reinforced and shared more widely.
Kirsty Williams AM: And then, to reassure, it's not just internally that we're looking at this. We have a contract with an external agency to do an evaluation--
Mark Reckless AM: That's ICF consulting.
Kirsty Williams AM: Yes. Yes, so that was done in the autumn of last year, because, as I said, we had concerns about whether this was really having the effect that was intended. So, my expectation is that we will be in a position to receive that report later on this spring, and of course it would be my intention that that report would be made public for people to have a look at what--
Mark Reckless AM: That was commissioned last autumn--
Kirsty Williams AM: Yes, in November 2017.
Mark Reckless AM: November 2017.
Kirsty Williams AM: So, I'm hoping to have that published before the summer recess. I'm very reluctant to say months; I've learnt not to say months, because they move.
Lynne Neagle AM: I'm going to go to Michelle now, Mark, because--
Mark Reckless AM: Sure. I will come back in if I have anything further to ask here after Michelle.
Lynne Neagle AM: --both of you asked for these questions, and that's what the pre-meeting is for.
Mark Reckless AM: Michelle, I defer to you.
Lynne Neagle AM: Michelle.
Michelle Brown AM: Okay, thank you. Would you be open, Cabinet Secretary, to the idea of adjusting the eligibility of the PDG so that pupils who have been looked after or adopted at any point within a previous given period of time would attract the PDG, rather than only if they're looked-after on a one-off date?
Kirsty Williams AM: As I said earlier, in questions from, I think it was, Llyr, who was talking about concepts of concepts of Ever 6, we are constantly looking at how we can get that balance between focus and flexibility for this resource. Llyr opened with the question of,'How can you absolutely ensure that these children are getting the money?', but then there's also a tension about how can you create some flexibility around the school's usage of the grant. So, we will look at that. I think there is the issue of where a school would know of a child that was looked after. Issues around adoption are slightly more sensitive, because we couldn't force a family to tell a school that their child was an adopted child. So, a family may be very open and very keen to explain that to a school, but we can't necessarily track as closely children who have been adopted, especially if that adoption happens before the child goes to school. We can't be in a position of forcing families to disclose this information if they don't want to, but we certainly can, as I say, look to strengthen our monitoring arrangements around PDG support for looked-after children and the impact that that's having. I just think we need to be a bit mindful of people's privacy in some instances. If they don't want to divulge that, it wouldn't be my job to tell a family,'You have to let us know if your child is adopted.'Lynne Neagle AM: Michelle.
Michelle Brown AM: Fair enough; thank you for that answer. The EAS consortium's approach to using the looked-after and adopted PDG is to use it as part of a broader approach targeted at vulnerable learners in general. What are your views on that approach?
Kirsty Williams AM: I'm a great believer in if we can get it right for our most vulnerable learners, we'll be getting it right for all of our learners. I gave the example earlier, for instance, of attachment disorder, and, Chair, you will know that I have had conversations. One of the emerging themes for me, as I go around visiting schools, is the impact and the growing awareness and the growing numbers of children who have attachment disorder, and how schools are best able to respond to that in their children. So, for instance, as I said about Carmarthenshire, there's been a huge effort to address that in the school sector in Carmarthenshire. Now, that has a disproportionate benefit for those children, because you're more likely to see attachment disorder in children who are care experienced, because of the nature of the lives that those children have lived, but that doesn't necessarily mean that attachment disorder is exclusively found in those children that are looked after. It can be found in other families as well. So, that vulnerable learner, regardless of their background, will benefit from having teachers who are better trained, understanding and have intervention strategies in place to be able to address that need.
Steve Davies: I think it's also important to add that this is not one region's approach; this is across four regions, so the others--. For example, ERW have run a significant programme looking at the impact of adverse childhood experiences on pupils, which has enabled teachers to detect some of the impact of some of those and then considers some of the work they need to do within the school but also with other agencies. So, it is something that's applied consistently across the four regions.
Kirsty Williams AM: I was in Pil Primary School recently where they use their PDG, both FSM PDG, and no doubt an element of PDG for looked-after, for nurture groups. So, for those children who really, really find it very difficult to be in the main classroom, they can have that nurture group experience to address issues around emotional behaviour, feelings, and it gets them in a position where they are able then to join the main classroom because issues around behaviour have been addressed and they're in a better position to learn. So, again, this is an example of how vulnerable learners in the wider sense can benefit.
Lynne Neagle AM: Okay. Mark, did you have anything you wanted to ask?
Mark Reckless AM: Yes. Can I follow up on tracking adopted children? I entirely understand that you can't force parents to disclose that their child is adopted. However, my understanding was that, in England, there was a dataset with social services that was shared with schools in a way that I'm not clear is happening in Wales and how, if at all, that links to the pupil level annual school census data. Perhaps sort of linked to that, isn't there an argument for making the parents of adopted children in the schools, potentially, with adopted children more aware that adopted children who were previously looked after have this potential grant, and would they not be more willing to disclose this, at least confidentially to the school and Government, if they knew there was this upside of doing so?
Kirsty Williams AM: We're actively looking at whether we should try and find a way of collecting this data, with the caveats that I just gave earlier. We can't force parents to divulge information that is a matter for them, nor would I want to. But there is an active discussion going on at the moment about whether we could create a dataset where people divulge this information and we can then track the children through. You're absolutely right. One of the ways in which we can often encourage take-up, for instance, of free school meals, especially in those communities where there is a sense of reluctance to apply for support--even though people are entitled to it, there's a reluctance to do it; sometimes we see this in rural areas--. Actually, appealing to the parents by saying,'Actually, this will mean more money for your child's school budget'is a much more compelling reason why people will apply for it then saying,'Actually, it's going to help you', because they don't want to be seen being dependent, they don't want to be seen being helped. But, if you say to them,'Actually, do you know that this means more money for your child's school?', they go,'Oh, all right then, I'll fill in the forms now.'So, you're right, I think there is something that we could do to make parents understand, in the round, that this has an impact. But we are actively looking at and discussing whether we could create a dataset around adopted children and how we can do that in line with data protection and data sharing. One of the things I am concerned about in the performance of looked-after children generally is how we can, across Government, work more closely together. We can't see the educational attainment of looked-after children just being a job of education. It's got to be a job of social services and the health service as well. There's got to be a joined-up approach to doing that. Now, officials were at the ministerial advisory group that's chaired by David Melding on prospects for looked-after children. They were there at the group last week. David tells me that the paper was very positively received by the group. I will be sitting down with David Melding to talk through what more we can do on the education side. I think there's really an appetite between me and the Minister for children to get a closer working relationship on this. We can't expect schools to do it on their own and alone. And there are things that we can do out there in local authorities to help improve outcomes. It's not just about the PDG; it is about, when social services are thinking about a placement, where does the discussion about where children are going to go to school--when does that take place? Do we talk about the placement, move a child and then think,'Oh my goodness me, what are we going to do about the schooling?'If you can imagine, the school could have been working really, really hard with a pupil to get them in a good place, to get them being able to access the curriculum, and then social services decide that the placement is being changed. So, we potentially lose all of that. So, a greater involvement in education and better linked-up working in local authorities will help us with this. It can't be just the job of the PDG. If we think we can crack this with just PDG, then we're being delusional. It has to be a cross-government approach at a national level, and at a local government level as well, to get this right. Sometimes, data protection--how can we break down some of these barriers between, you know, the school doesn't need to, schools shouldn't see, the entire social services report? Well, maybe the school does need to see some of that background information if they're going to have an impact for that child. So, there's more work to do, but it cannot be just the job of education on its own if we're going to make a difference, nor can it just be the job of the PDG to make a difference for those children.
Lynne Neagle AM: Thank you. Julie's got some more questions on the impact on adopted and looked-after children.
Julie Morgan AM: Yes, before I go on to those, I just wanted to support, really, what Mark was saying about adopted children and how important it is, I think, that the adoptive parents feel able to speak to the school and to give information. Because certainly any evidence we've had from adoptive parents, and generally knowing about what adoptive parents do feel, is that they often feel that there's a degree of a lack of sensitivity in the school about the issues of adoption. I would certainly support some move towards ensuring that the atmosphere was open in a way that would encourage them to realise that it would be a help for the children if there was an awareness in the school. So, I just wanted to really reinforce that.
Kirsty Williams AM: Yes, and that would chime with what I hear from many adoptive parents. I'm just trying to be sensitive by saying we can't force people to divulge this information if they don't want to.
Julie Morgan AM: No, but they need to be given the opportunity.
Kirsty Williams AM: Yes, you're right. We need to make sure that those parents feel that they can discuss this with school leaders and classroom teachers and explore how best those individual children can be supported, and how best we can support parents. Because, again--and I've said this a lot--after the quality of teaching, the second biggest impact on a child's educational outcome will be parental engagement. So, being able to create an environment where adoptive parents feel very confident and able to talk about their children's education is absolutely crucial if we're going to get that parental engagement that we need for all of our children.
Julie Morgan AM: Yes. Thank you. Going on to looked-after children, you say that the latest data on looked-after children's attainment is extremely disappointing. Can you expand on that and what effect the PDG has had in this result, or not had?
Kirsty Williams AM: Well, there's no getting away from it: the way in which we currently measure outcomes for looked-after children, the results are not good enough. It's a source of huge concern to me that we need to do better for those children. That's why officials are engaging with the group that David Melding is chairing, to make sure that education is integral to that group and it's not lost sight of. There's a discussion to be had about the cohort, whether it's right and correct to compare looked-after children to the main cohort, or whether these statistics are useful in any way. Sometimes as well--this is not to make an excuse because, as I've said in my paper, it's extremely disappointing, but sometimes it can be really difficult. Because the cohort sometimes can be very, very small, it can swing the statistics to look perhaps more dramatic.
Julie Morgan AM: I think, generally, when you look at how looked-after children do--
Kirsty Williams AM: It's not good.
Julie Morgan AM: --in a much wider evaluation, they're not doing well, are they?
Kirsty Williams AM: They're not doing well. So, that's why we've got the review, the independent review, into the impact of the PDG in this area. This is why Steve is doing the work that he is doing with the regional consortia because, clearly, at the moment, we are not doing what we need to do for that particular cohort of children. I would not make any bones about that at all.
Steve Davies: I think we will not move away from the fact that these children need good GCSEs to gain employment, so we'll continue to measure that. I think we need to look at more nuanced evaluations of the data at a lower level. So, for example, there were significant improvements in terms of PDG pupils who got three and four good GCSEs but didn't get past the threshold. That's not to cover anything that is not working in terms of improvement, but we will look at the full range and still hold on to the fact that we have to look at a measure that relates to the likelihood of these children going on to further education and training.
Julie Morgan AM: And then just one more question about the exclusion rates amongst looked-after children. They are, I understand, over six times more likely to be given a fixed-term exclusion. So, is there any way of trying to address this? Is the PDG used for anything to do with exclusions?
Kirsty Williams AM: We can look at exclusions. We also have to read across about how the whole system works, not just the PDG element of the system. So, we know, for example, that 66 per cent of looked-after learners have some additional learning need, so we can't just look at it in terms of this particular source of funding; we have to look at it at a wider level of support. So, given that the majority of those children will have an ALN, how can we make sure that our new ALN legislation and our new ALN regime meets the needs of these children? So, I think what we're looking at, again, is to say that it can't be just the job of the PDG. That's there as an additional level of support, but actually, we've got to get our ALN right. Unless we get our ALN right, lots and lots of these children are not going to get the support that they need day in, day out via that system. We do know that sometimes, if we're not addressing ALN, then we're not addressing behaviour issues that then potentially lead to an expulsion or potentially lead to non-attendance. So, we've got to look at it in the round and recognise the connections between the sometimes quite complex needs that these children have within the school setting, that are not just as a result of the fact that they're looked after; they have other needs as well.
Steve Davies: And investment in well-being--
Kirsty Williams AM: Absolutely. Steve is reminding me that that's why well-being is part of the national mission--to address issues around supporting children with their well-being, which is a way of keeping them in school.
Lynne Neagle AM: Thank you. We're going to move on to Schools Challenge Cymru now. Llyr.
Llyr Gruffydd AM: Thank you, Chair. I was just wondering what your assessment is as to why some schools made progress and others didn't.
Kirsty Williams AM: I think we have to recognise that the 39 schools that were part of the programme were in very, very different places. So, I think one of the reasons why some schools did well was because their needs were not so complex, not so deep-seated and a certain level of intervention was enough to get them moving forward. Some schools had very, very different needs. I think, talking to those involved in the programme, as always, we had some support advisers, challenge advisers working with those schools as part of the programme who were really, really excellent and really good, and were the right fit for the school and really drove the school onwards. We had other people employed in the programme who, perhaps, were less effective at driving change within those individual schools. So, what we have is a mixed bag of performance, again reflecting the very different challenges that those schools were facing, which led them to be chosen for the programme in the first place.
Llyr Gruffydd AM: Yes, okay--
Steve Davies: Sorry. One of the other key additional factors was the extent to which there had been recent appointment of a new headteacher to that school just before the programme had started, because--
Kirsty Williams AM: Leadership is all.
Llyr Gruffydd AM: And that was seen as a positive.
Steve Davies: A positive, yes. I think one of the challenges is that sometimes the time it takes to make changes in leadership can be protracted and can be a barrier, sometimes, to the speed with which you can move. But, for a significant minority of the schools, there had been recent new appointments of headteachers, which was seen to be contributing, when you looked at the evaluation, to the speed with which they were able to engage.
Llyr Gruffydd AM: The reason I was asking was I wanted to understand what lessons the Government is taking from that three-year investment, really, and how, maybe, you're applying some of those lessons to your wider school improvement programme. I know Professor Mel Ainscow identified six interconnected lessons, although I also note that the Cabinet Secretary didn't actually meet him for about six or seven months after coming into post. So, I'm just wondering, can you give us confidence that, actually, you are serious about taking lessons from Schools Challenge Cymru and applying them to the wider school improvement agenda?
Kirsty Williams AM: Well, absolutely, Llyr. I don't think anything should be read into when I met the individual concerned, because officials were meeting the individual concerned. Individual challenge advisers were meeting with the regions, there was crossover work with the FSM agenda as well, and we are absolutely determined that best practice and those interventions that drove school improvement are embedded in the new support that we have via the regional consortia. It's no coincidence that some of the best people that were employed by Schools Challenge Cymru are now in the employment of our regional consortia. So, those people that were really good and really made a difference don't work for the Schools Challenge Cymru scheme any more, they work for our regional school improvement services. So, we're absolutely determined. The things that we have learned, as always, are around leadership. It is absolutely key and crucial to have strong, capable school leadership as a driver for change within the system. We're looking at systems and processes, so, actually, has a school got in place comprehensive systems of tracking and processes within the school? We're looking at the teacher quality--how can we ensure that we have got consistent strategies in place to drive up pedagogy and teacher quality in the classroom? Collaborative activity--again, absolutely key. A school cannot see itself in isolation, and one of the key themes of the national mission is a self-improving system, so, collaborative working where schools are looking outside of each other, learning from best practice from other schools. So, there are lots of things that we've drawn from the evaluation that you will see as key themes running through the national mission, and, as I said, it's no coincidence that our really good people that were working in Schools Challenge Cymru are now working for the regional consortia, being able to use that expertise not just for a very small proportion of our schools--but that expertise is available to all our schools.
Llyr Gruffydd AM: Although Estyn has told us, of course, that you can't expect the consortia to really carry on with that level of intervention and the same kind of intensity as was provided previously, so I'm just wondering--
Kirsty Williams AM: In what way?
Llyr Gruffydd AM: Well, we were told by Estyn in evidence that they didn't necessarily think that we could expect the consortia to provide the same type of tailored support, and certainly the level of intensity with the improvement boards and everything--
Kirsty Williams AM: Well, the improvement boards are carrying on, so the improvement boards still exist, and I would--not that I want to argue with Estyn--
Llyr Gruffydd AM: Well, feel free; this is your opportunity to do so if you--
Kirsty Williams AM: What I would say is that those improvement boards are staying on, and our schools categorisation system is used to identify the level of support. Now, if you're a red school, that gives you the entitlement to 25 days of support. That is more than you would have got under the Schools Challenge Cymru programme, which would've been 20 days. So, actually, moving to this system allows us to really focus in on those schools that need that intensive level of support. And what's important for me, Llyr, in this, okay, is that those schools are not necessarily just the schools that were in the programme. Our system now of challenge, advice and support allows us to target resources across all of our schools and across all of our sectors, because you'll be aware that Schools Challenge was only available to secondary schools, not available to primary schools. What our system now allows us to do, via the schools categorisation, is to identify schools, wherever they are in Wales and whatever sector they're in, to have that intensive level of support that they need to make improvements.
Llyr Gruffydd AM: So, you're confident that that level of momentum is continuing through the consortia that was previously enjoyed by those particular schools, and you're also confident that there is minimal risk that they'll slip back to where they were, potentially, or at least part of the way back.
Kirsty Williams AM: Well, actually, there are some really good examples of some of the Schools Challenge Cymru schools making that sustained improvement now that the programme has come to an end. You only have to look at Tredegar, where we have seen continual improvement and moving up through the categorisation system. That school is now a green school, so they've been able to sustain their progress at the end of the programme. If we look at Armando in Eastern High School, again--gosh, my goodness me, we had lots of debates in a previous Chamber about the future of Eastern. There was one person that said that Eastern had to be closed and that the only way forward for that particular school was for it to be shut down, but what we have seen is investment via Schools Challenge Cymru, but ongoing, continual support from the regional consortium, and that school has come out of special measures. I pay absolute tribute to the staff of that school and that community that have done such a good job. So, I'm absolutely convinced that where we've got good leadership and good support, some of those schools are making continued, sustained progress even after the end of the programme. The challenge for me is for those schools that Schools Challenge Cymru didn't work for, and we haven't seen that progress--how we can use our school improvement system now to continue to work with those schools to give them the level of support that they need to make a difference. So that's what my focus is on now: a whole-system approach, rather than choosing 39 schools to get that level of support, when we recognise that there are schools everywhere, potentially, that need intervention, support and challenge, and in the primary sector as well.
Llyr Gruffydd AM: Okay. So, you wouldn't agree with a number of--well, the near-unanimous evidence that we've had from academics, some of whom are Government advisers from consortia et cetera, that this kind of programme such as Schools Challenge Cymru would probably need about five years to really have the impact that it was intended to have.
Kirsty Williams AM: What I would say is that, from my understanding, from the outset, it was a time-limited programme. The schools were aware of that. There were no surprises that it was supposed to be a time-limited programme. Evidence from across the UK showed that school challenge programmes have differed in time. So, for instance, Manchester's challenge was a three-year programme. So, there's no consensus about how many years you need to run a programme for. The previous Minister was quite clear about the time-limited nature of the programme. That's not to say it was the wrong decision, because what's important, and an ongoing legacy of the programme, was the investment in regional school improvement capacity, because at the time our school improvement services and the regions were young, in their infancy. The ability of individual local authorities to make a difference, with so many local authorities in an Estyn categorisation, was limited, so one of the ongoing legacies of the programme is that significant investment of over PS10 million in the capacity of the regions to be able to continue this support and the school improvement work.
Llyr Gruffydd AM: So, how disappointed were you that the money for Schools Challenge Cymru went back into reserves and didn't stay in your envelope, as you described it earlier? I presume you made a pitch for it. Did you make a case for that money to stay within your department?
Kirsty Williams AM: Llyr, we are constantly having discussions with the Minister for Finance around support for the education budget. The Minister for Finance was quite clear that it was a time-limited programme. We were able to secure investment from the Finance Minister to be able to secure the programme and run it and phase it out to make sure there was transition support, so as we moved from the schools challenge programme into the regional consortia, there were resources to do that.
Llyr Gruffydd AM: Did you feel there was a case to be made to add to the consortia's resources and be able to continue that level of support that schools had previously had?
Kirsty Williams AM: Well, we did make resources available to the regional consortia to do that. As I say, from the outset, the previous Minister was very clear it was a time-limited programme. Certainly the schools that I talk to--. And I want to be absolutely clear: I have visited many, many Schools Challenge Cymru schools. I have used that opportunity to talk to them about--Heolddu being one of them, Hefin, which we went to visit, and Willows, for instance. I'm going to one this afternoon--I'm going to St Illtyd's this afternoon, and I always take--. I've been to Caergybi in Anglesey. I always take the opportunity to speak to those teachers about their experience of the programme and to understand and assure myself that they are getting ongoing support that they see as an appropriate level for them. I think I've done 19 of the schools.
Lynne Neagle AM: Hefin on this.
Hefin David AM: With regard to it being a time-limited programme, the previous Minister was clear that it was a time-limited programme, but it wasn't quite as time-limited as you've decided to be. Is that fair to say?
Kirsty Williams AM: No, it was supposed to be a three-year programme at the most. So, there's no differential between when I decided it was time-limited and the expectations--
Hefin David AM: So the time limit was the same that the previous Minister put on it.
Kirsty Williams AM: Yes. No change.
Llyr Gruffydd AM: But Mel Ainscow did tell us that there was a fade out in that third year--not that people were giving up, don't get me wrong, but clearly there wasn't that commitment coming from Government because the decision had been made, and people felt that it was just fizzling out a little bit, and that impacted on the momentum.
Kirsty Williams AM: I wouldn't characterise it as that. I think there certainly was a transition phase when we knew that the programme was moving and schools were moving into a different level of support, but I certainly wouldn't describe it as a fading out--not at all. As I said, we were aware that the programme was transitioning and we were determined to get that right for those individual schools, and to learn the lessons and, crucially, to be able to apply those lessons right across the board.
Steve Davies: I can see where the perception would come if a programme director like Mel was managing the programme right to the end of the three years exactly the same, and it falls off--not a cliff, but it falls off, then the readiness for schools and the readiness in the system to hand over--so part of the shift of focus was that working as a Government with the programme in those schools to working with the programme, those schools and the region. So, I think, inevitably, one party might see it as a decrease in terms of emphasis on their work, but it was necessary for the transition.
Llyr Gruffydd AM: But does that cast a bit of a shadow over the transition, then--that one key player within that process felt as such, or are you confident that that was managed well and effectively?
Kirsty Williams AM: I think it was managed well, and we were very clear to recognise success where success has been achieved, but not to gloss over where the programme had not made an impact, because that wouldn't be good for anybody. There was a formal event to close the programme, which gave everybody an opportunity to get together, to be formally thanked, and for, as I said, congratulations to be given to those people who had really made a difference and, crucially, key staff transferred over into the regional consortia. So, for those individuals, they were able to continue their work, but just be able to apply that work on a regional basis rather than just in an individual school. So, I don't see that there was any fading out, but there was a transition into a new system, and many of those key personnel transitioned into the system with us.
Lynne Neagle AM: Have you got any figures for the numbers of staff who went from the programme into the consortia?
Kirsty Williams AM: Not off the top of my head, but I can let you know.
Lynne Neagle AM: Okay. I've got Darren first, then Mark.
Kirsty Williams AM: And can I just say, I met with some of them? I met with a selection of those people who had been involved in the programme to get their feedback on what they felt had gone right, and what they didn't feel had gone right in the programme. So, I took the time not just to meet the figurehead of the programme, but actually to meet the people who were doing the work in the individual schools. Sorry.
Darren Millar AM: Yes, I just wanted to ask you, you mentioned the figurehead there, I assume by'the figurehead'you mean Professor Ainscow. And you've mentioned as well that you said you wanted to learn lessons from Schools Challenge Cymru, but he told us that nobody had been in touch with him since March of last year in order to have any sort of follow-up engagement, or to have a dialogue about his perspective on what worked, what didn't work, why there were failures in some areas and why there were successes in others. Why haven't you sought that level of engagement with the person who was responsible for running the programme?
Kirsty Williams AM: I've had that conversation with Mr Ainscow. We had the evaluation of the programme. We've spoken to the people who were actually involved in running the programme on a daily basis in individual schools. We've spoken to the regional consortia. We've spoken to local education authorities. We've spoken to a wide variety of people to get their insight into the lessons learned, what was valuable and what was not valuable. So, a wide variety of people have been involved in those conversations.
Darren Millar AM: But you've hardly engaged with Mr Ainscow--with Professor Ainscow himself.
Steve Davies: I would actually say that I have had meetings--
Darren Millar AM: Since March of last year.
Steve Davies: Yes, since March of last year. I haven't got the exact dates for you. I've had discussions with Mel Ainscow, and my line manager at the time, Owen Evans, also had meetings and discussions.
Darren Millar AM: So, when he told us,'Since last March, I literally have had no contact at all with anybody from Welsh Government', he was telling porky pies, was he?
Steve Davies: That's not my recollection. I'll go back and check for you.
Lynne Neagle AM: If you could check and let us know, that would be good. Mark.
Kirsty Williams AM: Yes, well, I just talked about the celebration event to formally mark the end of the programme. My understanding was that it was July of last year, so people were engaged in that. And this idea that somebody has been ignored or frozen out is not how I see or how I regard that situation.
Lynne Neagle AM: Mark.
Mark Reckless AM: I have to say, with Professor Ainscow my impression was he took great, great pride in the work that he'd done with Schools Challenge Cymru, and I think he really enjoyed the engagement, the work and the positive relations with the Welsh Government. But I think there was just a degree of disappointment, perhaps, that at least he didn't feel that he'd been interrogated as much as he might have been about the lessons learned from the programme, and how perhaps to entrench those as well as possible with the regional consortia. I just wonder, Cabinet Secretary, if you could invite the professor in, perhaps to have a further debrief with you and take account of some of his thoughts and suggestions for what might help in this area.
Kirsty Williams AM: Well, Mark, as I said, I just don't think it should be right to characterise this as a failure to engage with a single individual.
Mark Reckless AM: I'm not characterising it that way, Cabinet Secretary.
Kirsty Williams AM: As I said, I met with him, Steve has met with him, Owen Evans has met with him, my special policy adviser has met with him and had discussions. So, there has been an ongoing dialogue. But, Mark, I hope that I have demonstrated since I took on this job that I am willing to work with a wide variety of people and to tap into their expertise if it can help me to deliver on the national mission. And if the advice to me is that we haven't sufficiently learnt the lessons, then I'll gladly have another conversation. What I'm saying to you--and I'm absolutely confident--is that we have learnt the lessons, we are taking that work and the good practice forward, and we have done that with conversations with a wide variety of people who had a view on this, from individual schools that were involved in the programme, individual people who were working in those schools, local education authorities, some of which have been very scathing about the programme, I should say, regional consortia--. So, the lessons, I am confident, have been learnt.
Mark Reckless AM: I'm glad to hear that, Cabinet Secretary, but I still say that, listening to Professor Ainscow's evidence, there was a perception, at least from him individually, that the programme should not be seen to be a failure, but a desire that the lessons should be learnt and a feeling or exception, at least on his part, that there was more that he still had to contribute to the process. And just to take one particular example, I think he referred to the Schools Challenge Cymru advisers being very successful in bringing in people who might not otherwise have contributed to this, and the regional consortia have had greater challenges in recruiting people, perhaps in some areas, of the same high standard of some particular individuals, but also from a wide range of different areas that the Schools Challenge Cymru do, and that there could be more to learn in that area as to how to support real excellence and a greater diversity of recruitment for those people. Is that something you could perhaps draw on his thoughts further about? Because I think he does feel that he has more to say to Welsh Government to help in this area.
Kirsty Williams AM: Firstly, can I say that I have never described the programme as a failure? I would understand, as someone who has put so much personal investment into the brand of schools challenges, that he would not want anybody to characterise that particular approach to school improvement as a failure. And I want to be absolutely clear that I have never described the programme as a failure, and I want to reassure Mr Ainscow of that. As I've said, gosh, my goodness me, if you saw my e-mail inbox and you saw the letters that come in, people are never shy in coming forward to give me advice on what I need to do, what I need to do next, what I'm doing right, what I'm doing wrong, and, you know, our doors are always open to listen to people who have interesting things to say about how we can deliver our educational mission. So, people aren't slow in coming forward, I can assure you, with advice.
Lynne Neagle AM: Julie.
Julie Morgan AM: Just very quickly. I'm sure the Minister is aware that Cardiff put extra funds of its own in to continue Schools Challenge Cymru advisers. So, obviously, they appreciated the value of the scheme, but it does query whether it should have gone on longer.
Kirsty Williams AM: Julie, I think, to be fair, there are some people who think the scheme was absolutely fantastic. I've had feedback from people who didn't think the scheme was helpful at all--in fact, they felt it was a hindrance. I'm very much of the view that the scheme worked really well for some schools in some areas and had less impact in some areas. There is a mixed picture. What's important to me is that we understand what it was that led those schools to make those big changes, how we can--like Mark talked about, the expertise--how we can keep that expertise in the system, and how we can apply the lessons to all schools.
Lynne Neagle AM: The next questions, and the final questions, are from John. So, we're going to need succinct questions and succinct answers.
John Griffiths AM: Some questions on regional consortia, Cabinet Secretary, and, first of all, the role that you believe they should play and how schools use PDG.
Kirsty Williams AM: Well, it's an absolute--. It's one of the things that I have been very clear to the regional consortia that I expect their challenge and support advisers to be asking schools about. So, one of the conversations that they need to have when they are in schools is exploring, with that school, how they are using their PDG, and how they're demonstrating an impact for those resources. So, it's a fundamental role for the challenge and support advisers in the regional consortia in their school improvement work. It's crucial.
John Griffiths AM: That sort of brings to mind some of the research that's been done on the role of the challenge advisers, Cabinet Secretary, which suggested that they're not actually challenging schools in that way, and that there's very little evidence of schools changing their decisions on the use of PDG as a result of any challenge from those challenge advisers. So, how would you respond to those findings?
Kirsty Williams AM: Well, as I said, in my scrutiny of the role and success of our regional consortia, I specifically asked them about free-school-meal performance and the use of PDG within their particular region. I think there is increasing evidence to suggest that good use is being made of that resource, and I think that is being fed back into us. Estyn tell us that it's one of the areas of school expenditure that is closely linked to research and an evidence base. But, clearly, there is more to do, and that's why we have appointed the new regional advisers for PDG going forward, because we think there can be improvements in how this agenda can be supported at a regional level.
John Griffiths AM: Okay. So, you would recognise the findings from that research.
Kirsty Williams AM: Yes. There's always more that we can do, and we are strengthening that role by the appointment of the new regional PDG advisers, so that individual school challenge advisers know what they should be looking for, know what they should be doing, and there is a regional approach to good practice.
John Griffiths AM: Okay. Could you tell the committee, Cabinet Secretary, how effective you believe the relationship was between the Schools Challenge Cymru programme and the regional consortia's school improvement functions, and to what extent it varied by region?
Kirsty Williams AM: I think it's fair to say that, on occasion, I have received feedback that there was a conflict between what was going on at an individual school under the school improvement programme and whether, then, they welcomed support from the regional consortia as part of that. So, in some cases, if we're being absolutely honest, there could sometimes be tensions between the two, but in most cases, the relationship was very, very positive and there was continuous feedback between the work going on in the schools under the programme and the regional consortia challenge advisers. But I'm going to be blunt and honest with people--in some cases, it has been reported to me--it's only anecdotal evidence; I haven't got hard and fast evidence--that there sometimes was a conflict:'We're a school challenge school so we don't need to participate or listen to any advice that's coming from the regional consortia.'Or, a local education authority said to me,'We felt that we couldn't get involved in that school anymore because it was part of a different programme.'Those were isolated incidents, and, as I said, it's only anecdotal feedback. In most cases, the relationship was a very positive one.
Steve Davies: Just very quickly, I think that, across the board, it was more complex in the beginning, getting--[Inaudible. ]. But when the programme itself recognised that they needed to work with the regions, and the regions needed to work with them--and I think Mel Ainscow in his evidence referred to this--it strengthened after some early challenges. I think Mel Ainscow was working in a number of regions--I can't remember which ones--so he's established relationships--[Interruption. ] Sorry?
Kirsty Williams AM: Central south.
Steve Davies: Central south. He has already been working in that, so I think it possibly had a stronger springboard in terms of the early working.
Kirsty Williams AM: Because he already had relationships that he had already developed in that particular region. As always, with many of these things, it's about individuals and relationships.
John Griffiths AM: Okay. Finally from me, Cabinet Secretary: in 2015-16, Estyn reported on regional consortia not sufficiently focusing on particular groups of pupils and tracking their outcomes--for example, vulnerable pupils. I just wonder what you are able to tell us in terms of to what extent there has been necessary progress since 2015-16.
Kirsty Williams AM: Okay. Well, I think it's important to recognise that all four consortia underwent monitoring visits in the autumn of last year, of 2017, which weren't reflected in the Estyn annual report for 2015-16. Estyn, through these 2017 inspections, have said that three out of the four regional consortia are making strong progress in their particular work, and we are continuing, as Welsh Government, to work with the other regional consortia to address the findings of the Estyn report.
John Griffiths AM: And that would include these particular issues.
Kirsty Williams AM: Yes, absolutely. The committee probably hasn't had an opportunity to see, but, only this morning, Estyn has released a report on more able and talented, and has positive things to say in the field of more able and talented, which was being asked about earlier by Members--you know, evidence of improved working and support in that particular arena. But, again, we need to ensure a consistency across all the regions, and that the findings of Estyn's most recent reports into regional performance are followed through.
Lynne Neagle AM: Okay, thank you. As we've got a couple of minutes left, if I can just jump back to the issue of practical uses of the PDG--because it's the only thing we haven't really covered and it would be good to get on the record--can I ask to what extent you'd like to see the PDG used to track the progress of eligible pupils? And the committee's heard that there are several different tracking systems and tools used by schools. To what extent is that an issue to do with what the Welsh Government is promoting? Or is it down to consortia or individual schools? And do you think there needs to be a more centralised push on how the tracking is undertaken?
Kirsty Williams AM: Firstly, can I say it's absolutely crucial that we track performance, absolutely crucial? That's the bedrock. We don't dictate to individual schools the nature of the system that they should employ in their school. There are a number of different programmes that allow schools to do this, but we are absolutely clear, and best practice and evidence shows us, that individual pupil tracking is key and crucial. And, as I said in the beginning, where we weren't tracking pupils at all, initial investment in PDG was used to establish these systems within schools. Again, one of the outcomes from the schools challenge review, and one of the lessons learnt, was, again, the importance of individual tracking of pupils throughout their school career. But we don't dictate a single system.
Lynne Neagle AM: Okay, thank you.
Kirsty Williams AM: But the principle is a really important one.
Lynne Neagle AM: Okay, and you don't think there's more scope to look at what the best system is that can be recommended to schools.
Kirsty Williams AM: That's not something we're actively looking at. I am actively looking at developing a Welsh toolkit around good practice, evidence base and research. At the moment we use the Sutton Trust toolkit, which is fine and excellent, but we are having active discussions about whether we're in a position, now, to look at developing a suite of a Welsh toolkit to support this agenda, and that's under active consideration.
Lynne Neagle AM: Okay. Well, we've reached the end of our session. Can I thank the Cabinet Secretary and the officials for attending and for answering such a wide range of questions? As usual, you'll be sent a transcript to check for accuracy following the meeting, but thank you again for coming.
Kirsty Williams AM: Thank you very much.
Lynne Neagle AM: Thank you. Okay. Item 3, then, is papers to note. Paper to note 1 is a letter from the Minister for Children and Social Care on Families First funding. Paper to note 2 is a letter from the Cabinet Secretary for Education, updating us on the supply teacher issue. Paper to note 3--another letter from the Cabinet Secretary for Education, providing further information following our meeting on 15 February. Paper to note 4 is a letter from the WJEC on availability of textbooks. Paper to note 5--a letter from Qualifications Wales, also on availability of textbooks. And paper to note 6 is a letter from the Cabinet Secretary for Education to the Children's Commissioner for Wales, following up on the dialogue that they've been having about our inquiry. Are Members happy to note those? Thank you. Item 4, then, is for me to propose, in accordance with Standing Order 17. 42, that the committee resolves to meet in private for the remainder of the meeting. Are Members content? Thank you.","As identified by Estyn, most schools are using this money to good effect. When PDG first started, in some schools it was spent on investing in tracking children, because they had never thought about tracking these children, they didn't have systems in place to look at the performance of these children and to have a system in place. Now they have moved from spending money on the infrastructure around support for FSM children into actual inputs in terms of teaching and learning.

"Summarize the discussion about why children on free school meals were less resilient in the exam system last year.
Lynne Neagle AM: Good morning, everyone, and welcome to this morning's Children, Young People and Education Committee. We've received no apologies for absence. Can I ask Members who are present if they wish to declare any interests? Okay, thank you. Item 2 this morning is our final evidence session for our inquiry into targeted funding to improve educational outcomes. I'm very pleased to welcome Kirsty Williams AM, Cabinet Secretary for Education; Steve Davies, director of the education directorate; and Ruth Conway, deputy director, support for learners division. Welcome to all of you, and thank you for your attendance and also for the paper that you've provided in advance. If you're happy, we'll go straight into questions, and the first questions are from Llyr Gruffydd.
Llyr Gruffydd AM: Bore da. I just want to start by asking some questions around the targeting of the pupil development grant because, clearly, we've had a lot of evidence around this apparent blurring of eligibility to an extent. I'm just wondering how comfortable you are that the money is being targeted appropriately because, clearly, it's being targeted more widely than just those eligible for free school meals, from some of the evidence we've had, but also that it seems to be predominantly focused on low-attaining frees--pupils who are eligible for free school meals.
Kirsty Williams AM: Thank you, Llyr. I think it's important to be absolutely clear that when it comes to individual interventions, those individual interventions should only be targeted at those children who are eligible for free school meals. But in some cases, schools may use their PDG funding to provide a universal intervention, but we would want to--in challenge advisers'discussions in schools--we'd want to have evidence that that universal intervention would have a disproportionate effect on the outcomes for children on free school meals. So, for instance, if I give you an example in your own region, Llyr: at Brynteg County Primary School in Wrexham, if you look at that primary school in Wrexham, their results for free-school-meal children at the end of their primary school period in school are equivalent to their non-free-school-meal counterparts. So, there is no differentiation in those results. One of the things that they've used their PDG for is to really focus on the concept of growth mindset in school. So, that's a universal thing that they've trained all the teachers in, but what we know is that that has a disproportionate effect on those children who are on free school meals. So, if you're familiar with the concept of a growth mindset, it's about really challenging learners to think that,'I can do things. If sometimes I fail, I pick myself up, I'm more resilient.'Now, that has been, as I said, trained to all the teachers in the school--it's an ethos for the whole school--but we have seen that the impact on the free-school-meal children has been even greater, and now they're at the same level. So, that's the important distinction. Individual intervention per child has to be targeted at those children who are eligible for free school meals, but sometimes a school will employ a whole-school approach to train their staff, for instance, and that, then, has to demonstrate it has a disproportionate effect on free school meals. So, growth mindset; it may be attachment disorder training for staff, for instance, where we know it's of benefit to everybody, but will have particular benefits for that cohort of students. With regard to more able and talented, you know, Llyr, that this is an area of concern for me, generally, within the Welsh education system; that we've not been particularly good at identifying, supporting and driving attainment for those children. I'm absolutely clear that PDG needs to be used for those children who are eligible to drive potential, whatever the potential of that child is, including more able and talented. And again, I'll give you an example that has been seen as good practice in Pembrokeshire: a window on the world bus, again paid for by schools. I don't know if you're aware of it.
Llyr Gruffydd AM: We've heard about that.
Kirsty Williams AM: Oh, you've heard about it; well, it's a really good example the window on the world. And, again, that's very much targeted at raising aspirations and giving children who are more able and talented, who are eligible for PDG, those experiences, and to really push them. So, yes, I'm absolutely clear that PDG shouldn't just be seen to be getting individuals to the average. For those children who are more able and talented, it should be used to support them--
Llyr Gruffydd AM: And we all share those aspirations, I'm sure, and you pointed to examples of good practice, but of course, it's not universal, is it, so what I'm asking is: do you think that the guidance is sufficient as it is? Do you think that there's a great enough awareness of how the PDG should be used at the coalface? And also, are you confident that consortia and others have the measures in place to be able to demonstrate that it is being used properly?
Kirsty Williams AM: I think, if we look at what Estyn has said about PDG, it does actually recognise that the PDG is being used to push more able and talented children, but as always with the system, Llyr, it's whether we can be sure that that is strategic and that it's happening across all of our schools. So, you're--
Llyr Gruffydd AM: But not just in relation to more able and talented, I'm referring to the eligibility and the targeting.
Kirsty Williams AM: Oh, the eligibility. You'll be aware that, on the advice of Sir Alasdair, we have employed and appointed new PDG regional advisers, and I think their role is going to be absolutely crucial in spreading that good practice across the region, whether that's use of PDG for more able and talented, or ensuring that PDG is used in the appropriate way. So, that's there to provide strategic overall advice. And obviously, we have been very clear with regional challenge advisers, in the relationship and the conversations they're having with individual schools, that they're really challenging their schools about the use of PDG, not just in terms of targeting, but the programmes, what the money is being spent on, whether there is an evidence base for that and whether we are clear on impact. So, I think the new regional advisers are going to be crucial in enabling us to ensure more consistent practice across the regions.
Llyr Gruffydd AM: So, are you content that eligibility for free school meals is the best measure, really, of identifying which pupils to target?
Kirsty Williams AM: Llyr, in the absence of anything better. I'll be the first person to say that maybe it's not as absolutely focused, but in the absence of anything different to identify a proxy for need, I think it's probably the best that we've got at present. And we will continue to have discussions with local government about whether there are different ways. We have to be mindful. Some of the policy levers in this area are out of my hands, so if we look at the roll-out of universal credit, for instance, we've got officials working very hard at the moment to try and understand what universal credit is going to mean and where we are going to be able to identify relative need, going forward. We haven't had any additional resource as a result of this, but we're very mindful that, potentially, this has an impact, going forward. And, officials are working all of the time, I must say, in conjunction with the department in England, to understand their thinking in this area so that we are in a position to make some decisions about what a notional eligibility for free school meals will look like going forward, but before I make any decisions, I want to assure everybody that there will be a full public consultation on that.
Llyr Gruffydd AM: Okay. Finally for now, on this issue of once a year, in January, if you're eligible for free school meals, then you're in that group for that year. We've had some quite strong evidence about how difficult that makes longer term planning for a number of schools and we've also been pointed in the direction of what's happened in England with the Ever 6, and I'm just wondering whether you're giving any thought to maybe changing that a little bit.
Kirsty Williams AM: Well, we're certainly giving thought to flexibility. In conversations with Alasdair, who is our independent adviser on this agenda, and individual schools, we're actively giving thought to greater flexibility and maybe longer term projections, so that schools know, for a number of years ahead, what their allocation will be. There are advantages to that system, because you could give that flexibility, you could give that long-term approach, but then, how do you make that responsive if a school suddenly has more children? We do know that, actually, the number of free-school-meal pupils is dropping. But there can be changes, you know, regional working in areas of north Wales in tourism, or maybe in other areas at Christmas time, parents are able to get a period of work. So, how can we create a more flexible system? We're actively looking at that at the moment. I wouldn't use it as an Ever 6 concept, but as an'Ever 2'concept. We have looked at Ever 6, and I'm going to be absolutely blunt with you: to introduce an Ever 6 concept for Wales would mean in the region of identifying an additional PS40 million. I'm going to be absolutely straight and blunt with you: we're not in a position at the moment to be able to identify an additional PS40 million to introduce an Ever 6. But issues around flexibility, certainly, are actively under consideration. In fact, we'll be having a discussion later on today about decisions, going forward, for the next two years.
Llyr Gruffydd AM: Thank you.
Lynne Neagle AM: Darren on this.
Darren Millar AM: It's just a very brief point in response to the PS40 million price ticket that you just put on that. That's, of course, assuming that you maintain the current level of PDG, yes? So, if you reduced the level of PDG slightly, but made it available to more individuals, if you like, via allocating it in a different way, then that PS40 million price ticket wouldn't be there, would it?
Kirsty Williams AM: I was asked a question about had I ever considered an Ever 6. We have looked at that, we've priced that up. I have to make decisions in the envelope of resources that are available to me. We could, indeed, change the way in which we allocate PDG money, but we have to do it within the envelope that is available to me, over PS90 million. That's a significant level of investment, but, of course, as always, Darren, we could cut the amount per pupil, but that might have quite challenging swings in allocations. What we have done--because what I am clear on is that there was evidence to suggest that in the secondary sector, a great deal of PDG was being focused on years 10 and 11, especially year 11, in catch-up provision, and you'll be aware, because we've said this in evidence to the committee in the papers, we've set a challenge to secondary schools to say,'Actually, the majority of your PDG allocation has to be used in key stage 3.'Now, we have to balance the needs, the moral hazard of turning round to children in years 10 and 11 and saying,'We're not going to provide catch-up opportunities for you,'because, clearly, those children need that support. But the evidence and the advice that we're receiving is: actually, strong focus on early years, primary and key stage 3, if we get that right, should negate the need for spending money on catch-up at years 10 and 11. That's why we, in our advice to local authorities and schools, say that we want to see evidence that they're spending this money earlier on in a child's career, rather than just a scramble at year 11 to say,'Right, we've got to get you through your exams.'Darren Millar AM: Okay, but have you actively considered, then, reducing the level you have?
Kirsty Williams AM: We've--
Ruth Conway: Sorry--I was just going to say that one of the things is looking at the scope of the definition, and I think it's about being more flexible with the definition, rather than reducing the amount per head.
Darren Millar AM: Okay. Thank you.
Lynne Neagle AM: Thank you. If we can go on, then, to talk about some of the practical uses of the PDG, you write in your written paper that'the majority of schools are making well thought out and appropriate decisions'on how to use it. But Estyn reported that only two thirds of primary and secondary schools make effective use of the PDG. Given that we've had it now for six years, would you not have expected there to be a higher level of schools actually making good use of that funding?
Kirsty Williams AM: Well, to flip it on its head, the vast majority of schools, as identified by Estyn, are using this money to good effect. So, that's the way I like to see it--that the vast majority of schools are doing well. What Estyn has also indicated is the intrinsic link here to leadership within individual schools, and as you'll be aware, leadership, improving capacity in leadership and developing leadership talent in the Welsh education system is a key priority for me in our national mission. Of course, that's being developed in a different work stream. I think what's fair to say is that the use of PDG is evolving over time. I think we are seeing, increasingly, more and more schools understanding how best to deploy that money for best effect for students. So, if we're honest, when PDG first started, I think, in some schools it was spent on investing in tracking of children, because they'd never thought about tracking these children, they didn't have systems in place to look at the performance of these children, and to have a system in place. So we've moved now from spending money on the infrastructure around support for FSM children into actual inputs in terms of teaching and learning. We're also seeing from Estyn that, actually, in terms of money following the evidence of what we know works, Estyn says that PDG is probably the best example of schools following tried and tested and evidence-based interventions to deploy the money. But clearly we want all of this money to be deployed as well as it can be, and again we come back to the decision I've made to appoint regional PDG advisers so that we can get that better consistency of approach. We are, in the discussions that I have with the regional consortia about how they challenge individual schools on usage, looking for very clear evidence of schools using the Sutton Trust toolkit, and we could have a discussion about whether that's the right thing, because that's on my mind too. But we want to see schools demonstrating their evidence base, and if they're not, if a school isn't doing that, okay, so demonstrate to us why you've made those decisions and, crucially, what are you doing as the school to judge whether that decision is actually making a difference for your individual pupils. So, if you're moving away from tried and tested interventions, what we know works, if you're doing something different with your money, okay, you need to justify that and you need to explain how you're going to demonstrate impact. But I think what we're seeing is increasing good practice in this area as the PDG develops and as our understanding of our school-to-school working in our self-improving school system also develops. I think we're seeing better usage of the money year on year.
Lynne Neagle AM: Thank you. Llyr on this.
Llyr Gruffydd AM: You mentioned some schools will be moving from the tried-and-tested interventions, really, and I'm just wondering to what extent that evolution of use of PDG is being driven by cuts to core funding.
Kirsty Williams AM: No, I don't think it's being driven by cuts to core funding. I think there has been--. One of the biggest impacts of PDG has not been--well, I suppose it is the money in itself, because the money has concentrated the minds, hasn't it? So, one of the most important things that PDG has done is highlight the importance of this agenda within schools, and really raise this up in the thinking of leadership and senior management teams in our schools, and has driven a focus on scrutiny and accountability in the systems that are working with our schools. I think the changing use of PDG reflects the journeys that schools have been on, some of them from a very low base where this was not a priority for them, to better understanding, and as research and as intelligence grows over time in this area, both in Wales and outside of Wales, schools are increasingly learning to use that evidence to tailor approaches in their schools.
Llyr Gruffydd AM: So you wouldn't accept at all that some of this money's being used to paper over some funding cracks from elsewhere. Because the unions and some others have told us that, whether we like it or not, there is some of that going on.
Kirsty Williams AM: As I said, Llyr, we're very clear about the usage that this money can be spent on in terms of individuals or universal application within schools, and that forms an important part of the checks and balances that we have in our system. Can we continue to improve, and ensure that more and more of our schools are employing best practice? Yes, we can, and as I've said, we've taken steps to put in place the infrastructure to support that.
Lynne Neagle AM: Thank you. Mark's questions are next.
Mark Reckless AM: Cabinet Secretary, how would you assess the impact of PDG on attendance and hopefully subsequent engagement with education from children who have free school meals?
Kirsty Williams AM: I think what's important to note is that, as Estyn have themselves said, over the period of the last inspection report, we have seen improvements in attendance, but I do think we need to, again, look at how PDG can support this particular agenda. And as always in the Welsh education system, there are some excellent examples of how schools use the money to address this. Ysgol y Preseli in Pembrokeshire is a very good example of how they've deployed their money. Forgive me; I can't off the top of my head remember the name of the primary school I visited, again in north Wales, where the school has proactively used this money, and they actually send teaching assistants out of school in the morning before the start of the school day, and they actually have a walking bus. They call at homes for children, and they walk the children to the breakfast club. So, they're proactively going out into the community and making sure that those children are in the classrooms, because the teacher said,'We recognised we had a problem with attendance. We tried a variety of means of improving that, but in the end we have taken this quite bold step--we actually send the staff out and they create that walking bus, and they walk the children into school'. They say that they know that, for some of those children, because of the difficult circumstances they and their families are living in, they probably wouldn't be in school if it wasn't for that proactive approach. So, we're looking again at what more we can do to support this particular agenda in terms of improving attendance, because although, again, there are examples of good practice, there is still a gap between the attendance of free-school-meal pupils and non-free-school-meal pupils. And, of course, we can have the best curriculum in the world with really high-quality teaching, but unless the children are in the classes then we're not going to make the difference for them. Whilst that differential exists, then it's going to be hard to close the attainment gap for those children.
Mark Reckless AM: I was actually quite shocked just reading in advance of this meeting that the proportion attending 95 per cent or more, who have pretty full attendance, was only 35 per cent for free-school-meal children at level 4, compared to 60 per cent for non-free-school-meal pupils. It still is an extraordinary difference. My colleague here showed me, I think, last week, a graph showing the link between attendance and attainment, in particular. When people were absent, a lot of the--. As I'm sure you're aware, there's a huge connection. What more can PDG do to deal with it? In the example you give I can see how a school with an awful lot of free-school-meal children could do that, but a lot of the free-school-meal children are actually in schools that don't have that high a proportion of free school meals, where it would be much more challenging to bring in that type of initiative.
Kirsty Williams AM: Yes, indeed, and I think it gets more challenging the older the children get. I think it's more difficult to find interventions that are successful higher up, so key stage 4. So, you can do a walking bus with little ones, can't you, but I don't suppose your average 15 or 16-year-old is going to take very kindly to that. So, you do need a different approach to that. But again, we see in Ysgol y Preseli the employment of staff to directly work with families of older children to reinforce the messages around, as you quite rightly say, the linkage between attendance and attainment, and really work with individual families to understand the barriers to attendance: what's going on in the family that is preventing that child from going to school, and what more can the school do to address those situations. But you're absolutely right; there is more that we need to do to address this particular agenda of attainment. I don't know if there's anything extra you wanted to add, Steve.
Steve Davies: There is also another very good example--and I take what you say about where there are small numbers--but in our secondary schools where there are significant numbers, they're investing PDG in resources like a school nurse and a school counsellor, not just to work with the children but link to other agencies on whom the children and the families are dependent to support them in terms of working with schools. So, it's something, particularly in our most challenging areas, where it cannot just be delivered within the school. So, good use of that resource is being made to employ people to support them in those wider areas.
Mark Reckless AM: Thank you. To what extent is PDG also used to seek to reduce the higher rates of exclusion for children entitled to free school meals?
Kirsty Williams AM: So, if we looked at permanent exclusions, there isn't a differential, but if we look at temporary exclusions, there we see there is a disproportionate number of children on free school meals that are subject to those exclusions. Again, I think what schools employing best practice understand is that you need a multi-agency approach to supporting that particular child. Some of those exclusions can be as a result of the need to address other issues going on in a child's life. So, this is where we come back to the committee's work, for instance, on mental health and support for children, support for behaviour in school. So, again, it's a multi-agency approach that I think we need, and, in our good schools, our really, really good schools, there's a recognition of that need to have a whole team around a child to support that child in education. With EOTAS, we made some changes last year regarding PDG for EOTAS. So, for those children who do find themselves in education other than at school, we are providing additional support that previously was not available.
Mark Reckless AM: Thank you.
Lynne Neagle AM: Okay. We're going to move on now to talk about the impact of PDG on attainment. Hefin David has got some questions.
Hefin David AM: It appears that the attainment gap at 2017 has actually widened, in spite of PDG levels. Is that correct?
Kirsty Williams AM: Yes. So, if you look at it--with the usual caveats about whether you can make direct comparisons on level 2 plus between the exams the year before and the exams that we had last summer--on the face of it, the gap has increased. I think what's important to recognise, Hefin, is a direction of travel. I'm sure we all want to, because I want to, have a discussion about why children on free school meals were less resilient in the exam system last year. But, if we look at the period that we have been employing PDG, over that period, we have seen a narrowing of the gap. I think what's quite stark, if we think about it--. So, if we look at where we started from: in 2009, one in five children on free school meals got level 2 plus--one in five--by 2016, we had got that down to one in three. Obviously, there's still a way to go, but, Sir Alasdair, who knows about these things, says that that is a significant improvement. Last year, we got some challenges. We need to understand why that happened, but I do think it's--
Hefin David AM: Why, do you think?
Kirsty Williams AM: Why, do I think? What I do think is there is no one answer. There is no one answer to this. I think we could look at and we can have discussions around the move from BTEC to science GCSEs. I think we have supplied figures to the committee about the significant change in the number of children on free school meals who weren't doing a single science GCSE and are now doing science GCSEs. We can look at the unintended consequences of literature. Again, we've supplied figures. Where children have done language and literature, whether that be through the medium of English or through the medium of Welsh, there is more resilience. So, it's that exposure to literacy in all its forms that I think could potentially make a difference. So, I think there's no one answer to why free-school-meal children were not so resilient last year. We continue to have discussions with Qualifications Wales to get a better understanding of this. At my next ministerial policy board, in May, we'll be doing a deep dive into this particular subject.
Hefin David AM: So, to what extent would exam boards be responsible for lack of grade stability?
Kirsty Williams AM: It could be one of the contributory factors. What I think is important is that there is no one, single reason why there seems to be less resilience in this cohort of children.
Hefin David AM: Will you be speaking to the exam boards about this and raising concerns?
Kirsty Williams AM: I have written to Qualifications Wales, we've had discussions about it, but I've asked them to formally submit evidence ahead of my policy board for May, where, as I said, we will be doing a formal, deep-dive discussion across the department about these issues. But, again, Hefin, what we've got to be clear on is--while we look at overall factors, you know, our overall national statistic--we did see some schools last year whose FSM performance was better than it had been the year before. So, what was it in those schools that enabled those children to do really well, whereas, in other schools, the performance was different? Even in individual cities, you can see a huge variety of performance. So, take Cardiff and Swansea, our two biggest cities. You've got schools in those cities with comparative levels of free school meals. So, you could have really high-performing schools with a very small number of the cohort on free school meals. The difference between those performances in a single city--so, that's the same local education authority and the same regional consortium--you can see a massive change. There's one school I can talk to: their free-school-meal performance is 88 per cent. A similar school in the same city with the same proportion of children on free school meals, their performance is down in the 20 per cents. So, I think what's important is that we can't draw broad-brush conclusions. For me, the challenge is to go into individual schools and understand what was happening in that particular school that ensured that their children did really well. We've got one school in Swansea, their FSM performance at GCSE level 2 outperforms non-FSM pupils.
Hefin David AM: But we still need to rely on the trends from a distance. If we take your argument that 2017 was an unusual year and the trends up to 2016 were positive, in a few years'time, when we will be looking back in two years'time, how are we going to measure this progress, say, in 2019? What are we likely to see and what methods are you going to use to measure progress that way?
Kirsty Williams AM: Well, you'll be aware that we are moving away from level 2 plus as a performance measure anyway because of the--
Hefin David AM: So, what performance measures will you use?
Kirsty Williams AM: So, for the lack of sophistication around the level 2 plus, and for the unintended behaviours that that particular performance measure has driven within our schools. I'll be making a statement shortly to the Assembly around a new performance measure for schools. We were, at our most recent secondary heads conference, working with schools to develop that. What's important to me is that we have a more sophisticated model that looks at school performance for all children. What level 2 plus does is narrow, very much, the focus of schools on an individual part of the cohort, usually the C/D borderline, which is why then we have problems with the number of students getting a B grade or above. We have marked success in our schools by saying to schools that a C is good enough. Well, if a child gets a C but came to you in year 7 and they were destined to get an E, yes, indeed, a C is a success, because you've moved that child on; but, if that child came to you destined to get an A* and gets a C, then we haven't done a good job by that particular child. So, we need a performance measure that is much more sophisticated, looks at each individual child, tracks that progress, and measures the value added by that school in performance.
Hefin David AM: Last question: therefore, should we have confidence in the data up to 2016? Is there a lack of confidence in that data?
Kirsty Williams AM: No, it's not a lack of confidence in the data. The data is the data. What I'm saying is, using that as a performance measure and an accountability measure within our school system may have been right for the time. I think it is now right to have a different way of measuring success in schools. I think that particular set of performance measures has driven certain behaviours--not because Ministers wanted that to happen, but as an unintended consequence. I think we can work together with our school system, learning the lessons of international best practice, to develop much more sophisticated accountability and performance measures for individual schools, and, I should say, for the Government. So, you will be aware of my intention to issue the first national report card on Government performance later on this year. So, this is not about trying to avoid scrutiny. It's about trying to develop a more sophisticated way, which is in line with our national mission, where every child's education is valued, and where the impact of the school can be tracked more effectively.
Lynne Neagle AM: Okay, thank you. Can I just ask, Cabinet Secretary, are you still holding on to your target of 37 per cent of free-school-meal pupils achieving the level 2 threshold?
Kirsty Williams AM: Well, we're moving away from the level 2 threshold. So, that's the first thing to say. So, we will want to develop a new suite, in line with our new accountability measures, as we go forward. So, we will be absolutely continuing to track and evaluate the performance of free-school-meal pupils. When we announce our new accountability measures, I will be in a position to address how we'll measure the Government's performance, and national performance, going forward. But, given the fact that we're moving away from level 2 plus, then we will need a different set of performance indicators.
Lynne Neagle AM: Okay, thank you. The next questions are on looked-after children and adopted children, and I've got questions from Michelle then Mark.
Michelle Brown AM: Thank you. Good morning--
Mark Reckless AM: I was to come in first, I think. I was about to ask about ICF consulting.
Lynne Neagle AM: Go on then.
Mark Reckless AM: I think my questions are first, but, Michelle, please do correct me if you were planning to come in before. The PDG for looked-after children doesn't quite seem to have the degree of visibility as the PDG for the free-school-meals. I think we had the MORI/WISERD survey--only 15 per cent of primary schools and 23 per cent of secondary schools were aware that PDG was targeted at looked-after children. I just wonder--can you clarify on the record here what is the role of schools with PDG for looked-after children as compared to the regional consortia in this field?
Kirsty Williams AM: Okay. I think it is absolutely fair to say that most awareness around PDG is around free school meals. There is less awareness around the availability of PDG to support looked-after children. I think that's probably in the nature of the cohort, so, there are more children subject to free school meals than are subject to being looked after. So, I think that's part of the explanation. A decision was taken in 2015 to regionalise PDG for looked-after children. My understanding was that the thinking behind that at the time was around a greater strategic deployment of that resource and to try and drive a greater impact than how it was being used previously. So, looked-after PDG is held at a regional level. We have looked-after children PDG co-ordinators--they're in their second year this year--to look at a regional deployment of that resource. And that resource can be done in a variety of ways, through individual allocation to a school to support an individual child, through to capacity building for the whole system. So, for instance, if I give you an example, in Carmarthenshire, there's been a big emphasis on attachment disorder and training teachers with regard to the impact of attachment disorder. Carmarthenshire happens to be one of those local authorities that does quite well in terms of attainment for looked-after children. But, clearly, I have--not concerns.'Concerns'isn't the right word. But I have asked officials to give greater scrutiny to how that resource has been used in the last year. Steve, on my behalf, wrote out to the system, setting out our expectations, but also advising them of the fact we will be asking very detailed questions of accountability for that money. So, what has that money been used on and how can you account for the effect? But, Steve, maybe you can give some greater detail.
Steve Davies: I think the challenge that--. One of the rationales for shifting--not that all the money stays in the region, but having a regional strategic support--was that, historically, the money was going directly with that child to the school. Given the quite often rapid turnover of children in schools--the very nature of looked-after children is they do sometimes move through foster parents--historically, what happened, the money lands in the school, because, at that time in the year, when it's measured, the school gets the money and can spend it on some additional support for staff, but quite often that child moves on to another school and the money doesn't transfer. Some schools will go through quite a number of years without having a looked-after child and will not think strategically,'How do I need to support them?'So, that was the rationale of the shift. In terms of the implementation of the regional allocation, as of this financial year finishing, we are going into local authorities and regions to evaluate where they've located the resource, what the impact of that resource has been, so that is reinforced and shared more widely.
Kirsty Williams AM: And then, to reassure, it's not just internally that we're looking at this. We have a contract with an external agency to do an evaluation--
Mark Reckless AM: That's ICF consulting.
Kirsty Williams AM: Yes. Yes, so that was done in the autumn of last year, because, as I said, we had concerns about whether this was really having the effect that was intended. So, my expectation is that we will be in a position to receive that report later on this spring, and of course it would be my intention that that report would be made public for people to have a look at what--
Mark Reckless AM: That was commissioned last autumn--
Kirsty Williams AM: Yes, in November 2017.
Mark Reckless AM: November 2017.
Kirsty Williams AM: So, I'm hoping to have that published before the summer recess. I'm very reluctant to say months; I've learnt not to say months, because they move.
Lynne Neagle AM: I'm going to go to Michelle now, Mark, because--
Mark Reckless AM: Sure. I will come back in if I have anything further to ask here after Michelle.
Lynne Neagle AM: --both of you asked for these questions, and that's what the pre-meeting is for.
Mark Reckless AM: Michelle, I defer to you.
Lynne Neagle AM: Michelle.
Michelle Brown AM: Okay, thank you. Would you be open, Cabinet Secretary, to the idea of adjusting the eligibility of the PDG so that pupils who have been looked after or adopted at any point within a previous given period of time would attract the PDG, rather than only if they're looked-after on a one-off date?
Kirsty Williams AM: As I said earlier, in questions from, I think it was, Llyr, who was talking about concepts of concepts of Ever 6, we are constantly looking at how we can get that balance between focus and flexibility for this resource. Llyr opened with the question of,'How can you absolutely ensure that these children are getting the money?', but then there's also a tension about how can you create some flexibility around the school's usage of the grant. So, we will look at that. I think there is the issue of where a school would know of a child that was looked after. Issues around adoption are slightly more sensitive, because we couldn't force a family to tell a school that their child was an adopted child. So, a family may be very open and very keen to explain that to a school, but we can't necessarily track as closely children who have been adopted, especially if that adoption happens before the child goes to school. We can't be in a position of forcing families to disclose this information if they don't want to, but we certainly can, as I say, look to strengthen our monitoring arrangements around PDG support for looked-after children and the impact that that's having. I just think we need to be a bit mindful of people's privacy in some instances. If they don't want to divulge that, it wouldn't be my job to tell a family,'You have to let us know if your child is adopted.'Lynne Neagle AM: Michelle.
Michelle Brown AM: Fair enough; thank you for that answer. The EAS consortium's approach to using the looked-after and adopted PDG is to use it as part of a broader approach targeted at vulnerable learners in general. What are your views on that approach?
Kirsty Williams AM: I'm a great believer in if we can get it right for our most vulnerable learners, we'll be getting it right for all of our learners. I gave the example earlier, for instance, of attachment disorder, and, Chair, you will know that I have had conversations. One of the emerging themes for me, as I go around visiting schools, is the impact and the growing awareness and the growing numbers of children who have attachment disorder, and how schools are best able to respond to that in their children. So, for instance, as I said about Carmarthenshire, there's been a huge effort to address that in the school sector in Carmarthenshire. Now, that has a disproportionate benefit for those children, because you're more likely to see attachment disorder in children who are care experienced, because of the nature of the lives that those children have lived, but that doesn't necessarily mean that attachment disorder is exclusively found in those children that are looked after. It can be found in other families as well. So, that vulnerable learner, regardless of their background, will benefit from having teachers who are better trained, understanding and have intervention strategies in place to be able to address that need.
Steve Davies: I think it's also important to add that this is not one region's approach; this is across four regions, so the others--. For example, ERW have run a significant programme looking at the impact of adverse childhood experiences on pupils, which has enabled teachers to detect some of the impact of some of those and then considers some of the work they need to do within the school but also with other agencies. So, it is something that's applied consistently across the four regions.
Kirsty Williams AM: I was in Pil Primary School recently where they use their PDG, both FSM PDG, and no doubt an element of PDG for looked-after, for nurture groups. So, for those children who really, really find it very difficult to be in the main classroom, they can have that nurture group experience to address issues around emotional behaviour, feelings, and it gets them in a position where they are able then to join the main classroom because issues around behaviour have been addressed and they're in a better position to learn. So, again, this is an example of how vulnerable learners in the wider sense can benefit.
Lynne Neagle AM: Okay. Mark, did you have anything you wanted to ask?
Mark Reckless AM: Yes. Can I follow up on tracking adopted children? I entirely understand that you can't force parents to disclose that their child is adopted. However, my understanding was that, in England, there was a dataset with social services that was shared with schools in a way that I'm not clear is happening in Wales and how, if at all, that links to the pupil level annual school census data. Perhaps sort of linked to that, isn't there an argument for making the parents of adopted children in the schools, potentially, with adopted children more aware that adopted children who were previously looked after have this potential grant, and would they not be more willing to disclose this, at least confidentially to the school and Government, if they knew there was this upside of doing so?
Kirsty Williams AM: We're actively looking at whether we should try and find a way of collecting this data, with the caveats that I just gave earlier. We can't force parents to divulge information that is a matter for them, nor would I want to. But there is an active discussion going on at the moment about whether we could create a dataset where people divulge this information and we can then track the children through. You're absolutely right. One of the ways in which we can often encourage take-up, for instance, of free school meals, especially in those communities where there is a sense of reluctance to apply for support--even though people are entitled to it, there's a reluctance to do it; sometimes we see this in rural areas--. Actually, appealing to the parents by saying,'Actually, this will mean more money for your child's school budget'is a much more compelling reason why people will apply for it then saying,'Actually, it's going to help you', because they don't want to be seen being dependent, they don't want to be seen being helped. But, if you say to them,'Actually, do you know that this means more money for your child's school?', they go,'Oh, all right then, I'll fill in the forms now.'So, you're right, I think there is something that we could do to make parents understand, in the round, that this has an impact. But we are actively looking at and discussing whether we could create a dataset around adopted children and how we can do that in line with data protection and data sharing. One of the things I am concerned about in the performance of looked-after children generally is how we can, across Government, work more closely together. We can't see the educational attainment of looked-after children just being a job of education. It's got to be a job of social services and the health service as well. There's got to be a joined-up approach to doing that. Now, officials were at the ministerial advisory group that's chaired by David Melding on prospects for looked-after children. They were there at the group last week. David tells me that the paper was very positively received by the group. I will be sitting down with David Melding to talk through what more we can do on the education side. I think there's really an appetite between me and the Minister for children to get a closer working relationship on this. We can't expect schools to do it on their own and alone. And there are things that we can do out there in local authorities to help improve outcomes. It's not just about the PDG; it is about, when social services are thinking about a placement, where does the discussion about where children are going to go to school--when does that take place? Do we talk about the placement, move a child and then think,'Oh my goodness me, what are we going to do about the schooling?'If you can imagine, the school could have been working really, really hard with a pupil to get them in a good place, to get them being able to access the curriculum, and then social services decide that the placement is being changed. So, we potentially lose all of that. So, a greater involvement in education and better linked-up working in local authorities will help us with this. It can't be just the job of the PDG. If we think we can crack this with just PDG, then we're being delusional. It has to be a cross-government approach at a national level, and at a local government level as well, to get this right. Sometimes, data protection--how can we break down some of these barriers between, you know, the school doesn't need to, schools shouldn't see, the entire social services report? Well, maybe the school does need to see some of that background information if they're going to have an impact for that child. So, there's more work to do, but it cannot be just the job of education on its own if we're going to make a difference, nor can it just be the job of the PDG to make a difference for those children.
Lynne Neagle AM: Thank you. Julie's got some more questions on the impact on adopted and looked-after children.
Julie Morgan AM: Yes, before I go on to those, I just wanted to support, really, what Mark was saying about adopted children and how important it is, I think, that the adoptive parents feel able to speak to the school and to give information. Because certainly any evidence we've had from adoptive parents, and generally knowing about what adoptive parents do feel, is that they often feel that there's a degree of a lack of sensitivity in the school about the issues of adoption. I would certainly support some move towards ensuring that the atmosphere was open in a way that would encourage them to realise that it would be a help for the children if there was an awareness in the school. So, I just wanted to really reinforce that.
Kirsty Williams AM: Yes, and that would chime with what I hear from many adoptive parents. I'm just trying to be sensitive by saying we can't force people to divulge this information if they don't want to.
Julie Morgan AM: No, but they need to be given the opportunity.
Kirsty Williams AM: Yes, you're right. We need to make sure that those parents feel that they can discuss this with school leaders and classroom teachers and explore how best those individual children can be supported, and how best we can support parents. Because, again--and I've said this a lot--after the quality of teaching, the second biggest impact on a child's educational outcome will be parental engagement. So, being able to create an environment where adoptive parents feel very confident and able to talk about their children's education is absolutely crucial if we're going to get that parental engagement that we need for all of our children.
Julie Morgan AM: Yes. Thank you. Going on to looked-after children, you say that the latest data on looked-after children's attainment is extremely disappointing. Can you expand on that and what effect the PDG has had in this result, or not had?
Kirsty Williams AM: Well, there's no getting away from it: the way in which we currently measure outcomes for looked-after children, the results are not good enough. It's a source of huge concern to me that we need to do better for those children. That's why officials are engaging with the group that David Melding is chairing, to make sure that education is integral to that group and it's not lost sight of. There's a discussion to be had about the cohort, whether it's right and correct to compare looked-after children to the main cohort, or whether these statistics are useful in any way. Sometimes as well--this is not to make an excuse because, as I've said in my paper, it's extremely disappointing, but sometimes it can be really difficult. Because the cohort sometimes can be very, very small, it can swing the statistics to look perhaps more dramatic.
Julie Morgan AM: I think, generally, when you look at how looked-after children do--
Kirsty Williams AM: It's not good.
Julie Morgan AM: --in a much wider evaluation, they're not doing well, are they?
Kirsty Williams AM: They're not doing well. So, that's why we've got the review, the independent review, into the impact of the PDG in this area. This is why Steve is doing the work that he is doing with the regional consortia because, clearly, at the moment, we are not doing what we need to do for that particular cohort of children. I would not make any bones about that at all.
Steve Davies: I think we will not move away from the fact that these children need good GCSEs to gain employment, so we'll continue to measure that. I think we need to look at more nuanced evaluations of the data at a lower level. So, for example, there were significant improvements in terms of PDG pupils who got three and four good GCSEs but didn't get past the threshold. That's not to cover anything that is not working in terms of improvement, but we will look at the full range and still hold on to the fact that we have to look at a measure that relates to the likelihood of these children going on to further education and training.
Julie Morgan AM: And then just one more question about the exclusion rates amongst looked-after children. They are, I understand, over six times more likely to be given a fixed-term exclusion. So, is there any way of trying to address this? Is the PDG used for anything to do with exclusions?
Kirsty Williams AM: We can look at exclusions. We also have to read across about how the whole system works, not just the PDG element of the system. So, we know, for example, that 66 per cent of looked-after learners have some additional learning need, so we can't just look at it in terms of this particular source of funding; we have to look at it at a wider level of support. So, given that the majority of those children will have an ALN, how can we make sure that our new ALN legislation and our new ALN regime meets the needs of these children? So, I think what we're looking at, again, is to say that it can't be just the job of the PDG. That's there as an additional level of support, but actually, we've got to get our ALN right. Unless we get our ALN right, lots and lots of these children are not going to get the support that they need day in, day out via that system. We do know that sometimes, if we're not addressing ALN, then we're not addressing behaviour issues that then potentially lead to an expulsion or potentially lead to non-attendance. So, we've got to look at it in the round and recognise the connections between the sometimes quite complex needs that these children have within the school setting, that are not just as a result of the fact that they're looked after; they have other needs as well.
Steve Davies: And investment in well-being--
Kirsty Williams AM: Absolutely. Steve is reminding me that that's why well-being is part of the national mission--to address issues around supporting children with their well-being, which is a way of keeping them in school.
Lynne Neagle AM: Thank you. We're going to move on to Schools Challenge Cymru now. Llyr.
Llyr Gruffydd AM: Thank you, Chair. I was just wondering what your assessment is as to why some schools made progress and others didn't.
Kirsty Williams AM: I think we have to recognise that the 39 schools that were part of the programme were in very, very different places. So, I think one of the reasons why some schools did well was because their needs were not so complex, not so deep-seated and a certain level of intervention was enough to get them moving forward. Some schools had very, very different needs. I think, talking to those involved in the programme, as always, we had some support advisers, challenge advisers working with those schools as part of the programme who were really, really excellent and really good, and were the right fit for the school and really drove the school onwards. We had other people employed in the programme who, perhaps, were less effective at driving change within those individual schools. So, what we have is a mixed bag of performance, again reflecting the very different challenges that those schools were facing, which led them to be chosen for the programme in the first place.
Llyr Gruffydd AM: Yes, okay--
Steve Davies: Sorry. One of the other key additional factors was the extent to which there had been recent appointment of a new headteacher to that school just before the programme had started, because--
Kirsty Williams AM: Leadership is all.
Llyr Gruffydd AM: And that was seen as a positive.
Steve Davies: A positive, yes. I think one of the challenges is that sometimes the time it takes to make changes in leadership can be protracted and can be a barrier, sometimes, to the speed with which you can move. But, for a significant minority of the schools, there had been recent new appointments of headteachers, which was seen to be contributing, when you looked at the evaluation, to the speed with which they were able to engage.
Llyr Gruffydd AM: The reason I was asking was I wanted to understand what lessons the Government is taking from that three-year investment, really, and how, maybe, you're applying some of those lessons to your wider school improvement programme. I know Professor Mel Ainscow identified six interconnected lessons, although I also note that the Cabinet Secretary didn't actually meet him for about six or seven months after coming into post. So, I'm just wondering, can you give us confidence that, actually, you are serious about taking lessons from Schools Challenge Cymru and applying them to the wider school improvement agenda?
Kirsty Williams AM: Well, absolutely, Llyr. I don't think anything should be read into when I met the individual concerned, because officials were meeting the individual concerned. Individual challenge advisers were meeting with the regions, there was crossover work with the FSM agenda as well, and we are absolutely determined that best practice and those interventions that drove school improvement are embedded in the new support that we have via the regional consortia. It's no coincidence that some of the best people that were employed by Schools Challenge Cymru are now in the employment of our regional consortia. So, those people that were really good and really made a difference don't work for the Schools Challenge Cymru scheme any more, they work for our regional school improvement services. So, we're absolutely determined. The things that we have learned, as always, are around leadership. It is absolutely key and crucial to have strong, capable school leadership as a driver for change within the system. We're looking at systems and processes, so, actually, has a school got in place comprehensive systems of tracking and processes within the school? We're looking at the teacher quality--how can we ensure that we have got consistent strategies in place to drive up pedagogy and teacher quality in the classroom? Collaborative activity--again, absolutely key. A school cannot see itself in isolation, and one of the key themes of the national mission is a self-improving system, so, collaborative working where schools are looking outside of each other, learning from best practice from other schools. So, there are lots of things that we've drawn from the evaluation that you will see as key themes running through the national mission, and, as I said, it's no coincidence that our really good people that were working in Schools Challenge Cymru are now working for the regional consortia, being able to use that expertise not just for a very small proportion of our schools--but that expertise is available to all our schools.
Llyr Gruffydd AM: Although Estyn has told us, of course, that you can't expect the consortia to really carry on with that level of intervention and the same kind of intensity as was provided previously, so I'm just wondering--
Kirsty Williams AM: In what way?
Llyr Gruffydd AM: Well, we were told by Estyn in evidence that they didn't necessarily think that we could expect the consortia to provide the same type of tailored support, and certainly the level of intensity with the improvement boards and everything--
Kirsty Williams AM: Well, the improvement boards are carrying on, so the improvement boards still exist, and I would--not that I want to argue with Estyn--
Llyr Gruffydd AM: Well, feel free; this is your opportunity to do so if you--
Kirsty Williams AM: What I would say is that those improvement boards are staying on, and our schools categorisation system is used to identify the level of support. Now, if you're a red school, that gives you the entitlement to 25 days of support. That is more than you would have got under the Schools Challenge Cymru programme, which would've been 20 days. So, actually, moving to this system allows us to really focus in on those schools that need that intensive level of support. And what's important for me, Llyr, in this, okay, is that those schools are not necessarily just the schools that were in the programme. Our system now of challenge, advice and support allows us to target resources across all of our schools and across all of our sectors, because you'll be aware that Schools Challenge was only available to secondary schools, not available to primary schools. What our system now allows us to do, via the schools categorisation, is to identify schools, wherever they are in Wales and whatever sector they're in, to have that intensive level of support that they need to make improvements.
Llyr Gruffydd AM: So, you're confident that that level of momentum is continuing through the consortia that was previously enjoyed by those particular schools, and you're also confident that there is minimal risk that they'll slip back to where they were, potentially, or at least part of the way back.
Kirsty Williams AM: Well, actually, there are some really good examples of some of the Schools Challenge Cymru schools making that sustained improvement now that the programme has come to an end. You only have to look at Tredegar, where we have seen continual improvement and moving up through the categorisation system. That school is now a green school, so they've been able to sustain their progress at the end of the programme. If we look at Armando in Eastern High School, again--gosh, my goodness me, we had lots of debates in a previous Chamber about the future of Eastern. There was one person that said that Eastern had to be closed and that the only way forward for that particular school was for it to be shut down, but what we have seen is investment via Schools Challenge Cymru, but ongoing, continual support from the regional consortium, and that school has come out of special measures. I pay absolute tribute to the staff of that school and that community that have done such a good job. So, I'm absolutely convinced that where we've got good leadership and good support, some of those schools are making continued, sustained progress even after the end of the programme. The challenge for me is for those schools that Schools Challenge Cymru didn't work for, and we haven't seen that progress--how we can use our school improvement system now to continue to work with those schools to give them the level of support that they need to make a difference. So that's what my focus is on now: a whole-system approach, rather than choosing 39 schools to get that level of support, when we recognise that there are schools everywhere, potentially, that need intervention, support and challenge, and in the primary sector as well.
Llyr Gruffydd AM: Okay. So, you wouldn't agree with a number of--well, the near-unanimous evidence that we've had from academics, some of whom are Government advisers from consortia et cetera, that this kind of programme such as Schools Challenge Cymru would probably need about five years to really have the impact that it was intended to have.
Kirsty Williams AM: What I would say is that, from my understanding, from the outset, it was a time-limited programme. The schools were aware of that. There were no surprises that it was supposed to be a time-limited programme. Evidence from across the UK showed that school challenge programmes have differed in time. So, for instance, Manchester's challenge was a three-year programme. So, there's no consensus about how many years you need to run a programme for. The previous Minister was quite clear about the time-limited nature of the programme. That's not to say it was the wrong decision, because what's important, and an ongoing legacy of the programme, was the investment in regional school improvement capacity, because at the time our school improvement services and the regions were young, in their infancy. The ability of individual local authorities to make a difference, with so many local authorities in an Estyn categorisation, was limited, so one of the ongoing legacies of the programme is that significant investment of over PS10 million in the capacity of the regions to be able to continue this support and the school improvement work.
Llyr Gruffydd AM: So, how disappointed were you that the money for Schools Challenge Cymru went back into reserves and didn't stay in your envelope, as you described it earlier? I presume you made a pitch for it. Did you make a case for that money to stay within your department?
Kirsty Williams AM: Llyr, we are constantly having discussions with the Minister for Finance around support for the education budget. The Minister for Finance was quite clear that it was a time-limited programme. We were able to secure investment from the Finance Minister to be able to secure the programme and run it and phase it out to make sure there was transition support, so as we moved from the schools challenge programme into the regional consortia, there were resources to do that.
Llyr Gruffydd AM: Did you feel there was a case to be made to add to the consortia's resources and be able to continue that level of support that schools had previously had?
Kirsty Williams AM: Well, we did make resources available to the regional consortia to do that. As I say, from the outset, the previous Minister was very clear it was a time-limited programme. Certainly the schools that I talk to--. And I want to be absolutely clear: I have visited many, many Schools Challenge Cymru schools. I have used that opportunity to talk to them about--Heolddu being one of them, Hefin, which we went to visit, and Willows, for instance. I'm going to one this afternoon--I'm going to St Illtyd's this afternoon, and I always take--. I've been to Caergybi in Anglesey. I always take the opportunity to speak to those teachers about their experience of the programme and to understand and assure myself that they are getting ongoing support that they see as an appropriate level for them. I think I've done 19 of the schools.
Lynne Neagle AM: Hefin on this.
Hefin David AM: With regard to it being a time-limited programme, the previous Minister was clear that it was a time-limited programme, but it wasn't quite as time-limited as you've decided to be. Is that fair to say?
Kirsty Williams AM: No, it was supposed to be a three-year programme at the most. So, there's no differential between when I decided it was time-limited and the expectations--
Hefin David AM: So the time limit was the same that the previous Minister put on it.
Kirsty Williams AM: Yes. No change.
Llyr Gruffydd AM: But Mel Ainscow did tell us that there was a fade out in that third year--not that people were giving up, don't get me wrong, but clearly there wasn't that commitment coming from Government because the decision had been made, and people felt that it was just fizzling out a little bit, and that impacted on the momentum.
Kirsty Williams AM: I wouldn't characterise it as that. I think there certainly was a transition phase when we knew that the programme was moving and schools were moving into a different level of support, but I certainly wouldn't describe it as a fading out--not at all. As I said, we were aware that the programme was transitioning and we were determined to get that right for those individual schools, and to learn the lessons and, crucially, to be able to apply those lessons right across the board.
Steve Davies: I can see where the perception would come if a programme director like Mel was managing the programme right to the end of the three years exactly the same, and it falls off--not a cliff, but it falls off, then the readiness for schools and the readiness in the system to hand over--so part of the shift of focus was that working as a Government with the programme in those schools to working with the programme, those schools and the region. So, I think, inevitably, one party might see it as a decrease in terms of emphasis on their work, but it was necessary for the transition.
Llyr Gruffydd AM: But does that cast a bit of a shadow over the transition, then--that one key player within that process felt as such, or are you confident that that was managed well and effectively?
Kirsty Williams AM: I think it was managed well, and we were very clear to recognise success where success has been achieved, but not to gloss over where the programme had not made an impact, because that wouldn't be good for anybody. There was a formal event to close the programme, which gave everybody an opportunity to get together, to be formally thanked, and for, as I said, congratulations to be given to those people who had really made a difference and, crucially, key staff transferred over into the regional consortia. So, for those individuals, they were able to continue their work, but just be able to apply that work on a regional basis rather than just in an individual school. So, I don't see that there was any fading out, but there was a transition into a new system, and many of those key personnel transitioned into the system with us.
Lynne Neagle AM: Have you got any figures for the numbers of staff who went from the programme into the consortia?
Kirsty Williams AM: Not off the top of my head, but I can let you know.
Lynne Neagle AM: Okay. I've got Darren first, then Mark.
Kirsty Williams AM: And can I just say, I met with some of them? I met with a selection of those people who had been involved in the programme to get their feedback on what they felt had gone right, and what they didn't feel had gone right in the programme. So, I took the time not just to meet the figurehead of the programme, but actually to meet the people who were doing the work in the individual schools. Sorry.
Darren Millar AM: Yes, I just wanted to ask you, you mentioned the figurehead there, I assume by'the figurehead'you mean Professor Ainscow. And you've mentioned as well that you said you wanted to learn lessons from Schools Challenge Cymru, but he told us that nobody had been in touch with him since March of last year in order to have any sort of follow-up engagement, or to have a dialogue about his perspective on what worked, what didn't work, why there were failures in some areas and why there were successes in others. Why haven't you sought that level of engagement with the person who was responsible for running the programme?
Kirsty Williams AM: I've had that conversation with Mr Ainscow. We had the evaluation of the programme. We've spoken to the people who were actually involved in running the programme on a daily basis in individual schools. We've spoken to the regional consortia. We've spoken to local education authorities. We've spoken to a wide variety of people to get their insight into the lessons learned, what was valuable and what was not valuable. So, a wide variety of people have been involved in those conversations.
Darren Millar AM: But you've hardly engaged with Mr Ainscow--with Professor Ainscow himself.
Steve Davies: I would actually say that I have had meetings--
Darren Millar AM: Since March of last year.
Steve Davies: Yes, since March of last year. I haven't got the exact dates for you. I've had discussions with Mel Ainscow, and my line manager at the time, Owen Evans, also had meetings and discussions.
Darren Millar AM: So, when he told us,'Since last March, I literally have had no contact at all with anybody from Welsh Government', he was telling porky pies, was he?
Steve Davies: That's not my recollection. I'll go back and check for you.
Lynne Neagle AM: If you could check and let us know, that would be good. Mark.
Kirsty Williams AM: Yes, well, I just talked about the celebration event to formally mark the end of the programme. My understanding was that it was July of last year, so people were engaged in that. And this idea that somebody has been ignored or frozen out is not how I see or how I regard that situation.
Lynne Neagle AM: Mark.
Mark Reckless AM: I have to say, with Professor Ainscow my impression was he took great, great pride in the work that he'd done with Schools Challenge Cymru, and I think he really enjoyed the engagement, the work and the positive relations with the Welsh Government. But I think there was just a degree of disappointment, perhaps, that at least he didn't feel that he'd been interrogated as much as he might have been about the lessons learned from the programme, and how perhaps to entrench those as well as possible with the regional consortia. I just wonder, Cabinet Secretary, if you could invite the professor in, perhaps to have a further debrief with you and take account of some of his thoughts and suggestions for what might help in this area.
Kirsty Williams AM: Well, Mark, as I said, I just don't think it should be right to characterise this as a failure to engage with a single individual.
Mark Reckless AM: I'm not characterising it that way, Cabinet Secretary.
Kirsty Williams AM: As I said, I met with him, Steve has met with him, Owen Evans has met with him, my special policy adviser has met with him and had discussions. So, there has been an ongoing dialogue. But, Mark, I hope that I have demonstrated since I took on this job that I am willing to work with a wide variety of people and to tap into their expertise if it can help me to deliver on the national mission. And if the advice to me is that we haven't sufficiently learnt the lessons, then I'll gladly have another conversation. What I'm saying to you--and I'm absolutely confident--is that we have learnt the lessons, we are taking that work and the good practice forward, and we have done that with conversations with a wide variety of people who had a view on this, from individual schools that were involved in the programme, individual people who were working in those schools, local education authorities, some of which have been very scathing about the programme, I should say, regional consortia--. So, the lessons, I am confident, have been learnt.
Mark Reckless AM: I'm glad to hear that, Cabinet Secretary, but I still say that, listening to Professor Ainscow's evidence, there was a perception, at least from him individually, that the programme should not be seen to be a failure, but a desire that the lessons should be learnt and a feeling or exception, at least on his part, that there was more that he still had to contribute to the process. And just to take one particular example, I think he referred to the Schools Challenge Cymru advisers being very successful in bringing in people who might not otherwise have contributed to this, and the regional consortia have had greater challenges in recruiting people, perhaps in some areas, of the same high standard of some particular individuals, but also from a wide range of different areas that the Schools Challenge Cymru do, and that there could be more to learn in that area as to how to support real excellence and a greater diversity of recruitment for those people. Is that something you could perhaps draw on his thoughts further about? Because I think he does feel that he has more to say to Welsh Government to help in this area.
Kirsty Williams AM: Firstly, can I say that I have never described the programme as a failure? I would understand, as someone who has put so much personal investment into the brand of schools challenges, that he would not want anybody to characterise that particular approach to school improvement as a failure. And I want to be absolutely clear that I have never described the programme as a failure, and I want to reassure Mr Ainscow of that. As I've said, gosh, my goodness me, if you saw my e-mail inbox and you saw the letters that come in, people are never shy in coming forward to give me advice on what I need to do, what I need to do next, what I'm doing right, what I'm doing wrong, and, you know, our doors are always open to listen to people who have interesting things to say about how we can deliver our educational mission. So, people aren't slow in coming forward, I can assure you, with advice.
Lynne Neagle AM: Julie.
Julie Morgan AM: Just very quickly. I'm sure the Minister is aware that Cardiff put extra funds of its own in to continue Schools Challenge Cymru advisers. So, obviously, they appreciated the value of the scheme, but it does query whether it should have gone on longer.
Kirsty Williams AM: Julie, I think, to be fair, there are some people who think the scheme was absolutely fantastic. I've had feedback from people who didn't think the scheme was helpful at all--in fact, they felt it was a hindrance. I'm very much of the view that the scheme worked really well for some schools in some areas and had less impact in some areas. There is a mixed picture. What's important to me is that we understand what it was that led those schools to make those big changes, how we can--like Mark talked about, the expertise--how we can keep that expertise in the system, and how we can apply the lessons to all schools.
Lynne Neagle AM: The next questions, and the final questions, are from John. So, we're going to need succinct questions and succinct answers.
John Griffiths AM: Some questions on regional consortia, Cabinet Secretary, and, first of all, the role that you believe they should play and how schools use PDG.
Kirsty Williams AM: Well, it's an absolute--. It's one of the things that I have been very clear to the regional consortia that I expect their challenge and support advisers to be asking schools about. So, one of the conversations that they need to have when they are in schools is exploring, with that school, how they are using their PDG, and how they're demonstrating an impact for those resources. So, it's a fundamental role for the challenge and support advisers in the regional consortia in their school improvement work. It's crucial.
John Griffiths AM: That sort of brings to mind some of the research that's been done on the role of the challenge advisers, Cabinet Secretary, which suggested that they're not actually challenging schools in that way, and that there's very little evidence of schools changing their decisions on the use of PDG as a result of any challenge from those challenge advisers. So, how would you respond to those findings?
Kirsty Williams AM: Well, as I said, in my scrutiny of the role and success of our regional consortia, I specifically asked them about free-school-meal performance and the use of PDG within their particular region. I think there is increasing evidence to suggest that good use is being made of that resource, and I think that is being fed back into us. Estyn tell us that it's one of the areas of school expenditure that is closely linked to research and an evidence base. But, clearly, there is more to do, and that's why we have appointed the new regional advisers for PDG going forward, because we think there can be improvements in how this agenda can be supported at a regional level.
John Griffiths AM: Okay. So, you would recognise the findings from that research.
Kirsty Williams AM: Yes. There's always more that we can do, and we are strengthening that role by the appointment of the new regional PDG advisers, so that individual school challenge advisers know what they should be looking for, know what they should be doing, and there is a regional approach to good practice.
John Griffiths AM: Okay. Could you tell the committee, Cabinet Secretary, how effective you believe the relationship was between the Schools Challenge Cymru programme and the regional consortia's school improvement functions, and to what extent it varied by region?
Kirsty Williams AM: I think it's fair to say that, on occasion, I have received feedback that there was a conflict between what was going on at an individual school under the school improvement programme and whether, then, they welcomed support from the regional consortia as part of that. So, in some cases, if we're being absolutely honest, there could sometimes be tensions between the two, but in most cases, the relationship was very, very positive and there was continuous feedback between the work going on in the schools under the programme and the regional consortia challenge advisers. But I'm going to be blunt and honest with people--in some cases, it has been reported to me--it's only anecdotal evidence; I haven't got hard and fast evidence--that there sometimes was a conflict:'We're a school challenge school so we don't need to participate or listen to any advice that's coming from the regional consortia.'Or, a local education authority said to me,'We felt that we couldn't get involved in that school anymore because it was part of a different programme.'Those were isolated incidents, and, as I said, it's only anecdotal feedback. In most cases, the relationship was a very positive one.
Steve Davies: Just very quickly, I think that, across the board, it was more complex in the beginning, getting--[Inaudible. ]. But when the programme itself recognised that they needed to work with the regions, and the regions needed to work with them--and I think Mel Ainscow in his evidence referred to this--it strengthened after some early challenges. I think Mel Ainscow was working in a number of regions--I can't remember which ones--so he's established relationships--[Interruption. ] Sorry?
Kirsty Williams AM: Central south.
Steve Davies: Central south. He has already been working in that, so I think it possibly had a stronger springboard in terms of the early working.
Kirsty Williams AM: Because he already had relationships that he had already developed in that particular region. As always, with many of these things, it's about individuals and relationships.
John Griffiths AM: Okay. Finally from me, Cabinet Secretary: in 2015-16, Estyn reported on regional consortia not sufficiently focusing on particular groups of pupils and tracking their outcomes--for example, vulnerable pupils. I just wonder what you are able to tell us in terms of to what extent there has been necessary progress since 2015-16.
Kirsty Williams AM: Okay. Well, I think it's important to recognise that all four consortia underwent monitoring visits in the autumn of last year, of 2017, which weren't reflected in the Estyn annual report for 2015-16. Estyn, through these 2017 inspections, have said that three out of the four regional consortia are making strong progress in their particular work, and we are continuing, as Welsh Government, to work with the other regional consortia to address the findings of the Estyn report.
John Griffiths AM: And that would include these particular issues.
Kirsty Williams AM: Yes, absolutely. The committee probably hasn't had an opportunity to see, but, only this morning, Estyn has released a report on more able and talented, and has positive things to say in the field of more able and talented, which was being asked about earlier by Members--you know, evidence of improved working and support in that particular arena. But, again, we need to ensure a consistency across all the regions, and that the findings of Estyn's most recent reports into regional performance are followed through.
Lynne Neagle AM: Okay, thank you. As we've got a couple of minutes left, if I can just jump back to the issue of practical uses of the PDG--because it's the only thing we haven't really covered and it would be good to get on the record--can I ask to what extent you'd like to see the PDG used to track the progress of eligible pupils? And the committee's heard that there are several different tracking systems and tools used by schools. To what extent is that an issue to do with what the Welsh Government is promoting? Or is it down to consortia or individual schools? And do you think there needs to be a more centralised push on how the tracking is undertaken?
Kirsty Williams AM: Firstly, can I say it's absolutely crucial that we track performance, absolutely crucial? That's the bedrock. We don't dictate to individual schools the nature of the system that they should employ in their school. There are a number of different programmes that allow schools to do this, but we are absolutely clear, and best practice and evidence shows us, that individual pupil tracking is key and crucial. And, as I said in the beginning, where we weren't tracking pupils at all, initial investment in PDG was used to establish these systems within schools. Again, one of the outcomes from the schools challenge review, and one of the lessons learnt, was, again, the importance of individual tracking of pupils throughout their school career. But we don't dictate a single system.
Lynne Neagle AM: Okay, thank you.
Kirsty Williams AM: But the principle is a really important one.
Lynne Neagle AM: Okay, and you don't think there's more scope to look at what the best system is that can be recommended to schools.
Kirsty Williams AM: That's not something we're actively looking at. I am actively looking at developing a Welsh toolkit around good practice, evidence base and research. At the moment we use the Sutton Trust toolkit, which is fine and excellent, but we are having active discussions about whether we're in a position, now, to look at developing a suite of a Welsh toolkit to support this agenda, and that's under active consideration.
Lynne Neagle AM: Okay. Well, we've reached the end of our session. Can I thank the Cabinet Secretary and the officials for attending and for answering such a wide range of questions? As usual, you'll be sent a transcript to check for accuracy following the meeting, but thank you again for coming.
Kirsty Williams AM: Thank you very much.
Lynne Neagle AM: Thank you. Okay. Item 3, then, is papers to note. Paper to note 1 is a letter from the Minister for Children and Social Care on Families First funding. Paper to note 2 is a letter from the Cabinet Secretary for Education, updating us on the supply teacher issue. Paper to note 3--another letter from the Cabinet Secretary for Education, providing further information following our meeting on 15 February. Paper to note 4 is a letter from the WJEC on availability of textbooks. Paper to note 5--a letter from Qualifications Wales, also on availability of textbooks. And paper to note 6 is a letter from the Cabinet Secretary for Education to the Children's Commissioner for Wales, following up on the dialogue that they've been having about our inquiry. Are Members happy to note those? Thank you. Item 4, then, is for me to propose, in accordance with Standing Order 17. 42, that the committee resolves to meet in private for the remainder of the meeting. Are Members content? Thank you.","According to Kirsty Williams, there is no specific answer. There's no single reason why there seems to be less resilience in this cohort of children. They think that they can't draw broad-brush conclusions. The challenge is to go into individual schools and understand what was happening in that particular school that ensured that their children did really well. They continue to have discussions with Qualifications Wales to get a better understanding of this, and in May, they'll be doing a deep dive into this particular subject.",qmsum
"Summarize the meeting
Grad A: Why?
Grad D: Um.
Grad E: I'm known. I {disfmarker}
Grad A: No, cuz she already told me it, before she told you.
Grad E: No, she told me a long time ago. She told me {disfmarker} she told me like two weeks ago.
Grad A: Oh, well, it doesn't matter what time.
Grad B: OK. You know how to toggle the display width {pause} function {disfmarker}
Grad A: Well maybe she hadn't just started transcribing me yet.
Grad D: Wow.
Grad A: Anyway.
Grad D: What is it?
Grad E: Let me explain something to you.
Grad D: Um,
Grad E: My laugh is better than yours.
Grad D: there.
Grad A: I beg to differ.
Grad B: Yo.
Grad D: Um, OK.
Grad A: But you have to say something genuinely funny before you'll get an example.
Grad E: Yeah.
Grad D: The thing is I don't know how to get to the next page. Here.
Grad E: No. You should be {disfmarker} at least be self - satisfied enough to laugh at your own jokes.
Grad D: Actually I thought {disfmarker}
Grad A: No, it's a different laugh.
Grad D: There.
Grad A: Ooh, wow!
Grad D: How weird.
Grad E: Oh! Holy mackerel.
Grad A: Wow. Whoa!
Grad D: What? ! Oh. OK. I wasn't even doing anything. {vocalsound} OK.
Grad A: Uh.
Grad E: Eva's got a laptop, she's trying to show it off.
Grad D: That was r actually Robert's idea. But anyhow. Um
Professor F: O K. So, here we are.
Grad E: Once again.
Professor F: Once again, right, together. Um, so we haven't had a meeting for a while, and {disfmarker} and probably won't have one next week, I think a number of people are gone. Um, so Robert, why don't you bring us up to date on where we are with EDU?
Grad B: Um, uh in a {disfmarker} in a smaller group we had uh, talked and decided about continuation of the data collection. So Fey's time with us is almost officially over, and she brought us some thirty subjects and, t collected the data, and ten dialogues have been transcribed and can be looked at. If you're interested in that, talk to me. Um, and we found another uh, cogsci student who's interested in playing wizard for us. Here we're gonna make it a little bit more complicated for the subjects, uh this round. She's actually suggested to look um, at the psychology department students, because they have to partake in two experiments in order to fulfill some requirements. So they have to be subjected, {vocalsound} {comment} before they can actually graduate. And um, we want to design it so that they really have to think about having some time, two days, for example, to plan certain things and figure out which can be done at what time, and, um, sort of package the whole thing in a {disfmarker} in a re in a few more complicated um, structure. That's for the data collection. As for SmartKom, I'm {disfmarker} the last SmartKom meeting I mentioned that we have some problems with the synthesis, which as of this morning should be resolved. And, so,
Professor F: Good.
Grad B:"" should be"" means they aren't yet, but {disfmarker} but I think I have the info now that I need. Plus, Johno and I are meeting tomorrow, so maybe uh uh, when tomorrow is over, we're done. And ha n hav we'll never have to look at it again Maybe it'll take some more time, to be realistic, but at least we're {disfmarker} we're seeing the end of the tunnel there. That was that. Um, the uh, uh I don't think we need to discuss the formalism that'll be done officially s once we're done. Um, something happened, in {disfmarker} on Eva's side with the PRM that we're gonna look at today, and um, we have a visitor from Bruchsal from the International University. Andreas, I think you've met everyone except Nancy.
Grad A: Sorry. Hi. Hi.
Grad C: Yeah.
Grad B: Hi. Hi.
Grad A: So when you said"" Andreas"" I thought you were talking about Stolcke.
Grad B: And, um,
Grad A: Now I know that we aren't, OK.
Grad B: Andy, you actually go by Andy, right? Oh, OK.
Grad C: Yeah.
Grad B: Eh {disfmarker}
Grad C: Cuz there is another Andreas around,
Grad A: Hmm.
Grad C: so, to avoid some confusion.
Grad B: That will be {pause} Reuter? Oh, OK.
Grad C: Yeah.
Grad B: So my scientific director of the EML is also the dean of the International University, one of his many occupations that just contributes to the fact that he is very occupied. And, um, the {disfmarker} um, he @ @ might tell us a little bit about what he's actually doing, and why it is s somewhat related, and {disfmarker} by uh using maybe some of the same technologies that we are using. And um. Was that enough of an update?
Professor F: I think so.
Grad B: In what order shall we proceed?
Grad D: OK.
Grad B: Maybe you have your on - line {disfmarker}
Grad D: Uh, yeah, sure. Um, so, I've be just been looking at, um, Ack! What are you doing? Yeah. OK. Um, I've been looking at the PRM stuff. Um, so, this is, sort of like the latest thing I have on it, and I sorta constructed a couple of classes. Like, a user class, a site class, and {disfmarker} and you know, a time, a route, and then {disfmarker} and a query class. And I tried to simplify it down a little bit, so that I can actually um, look at it more. It's the same paper that I gave to Jerry last time. Um, so basically I took out a lot of stuff, a lot of the decision nodes, and then tried to {disfmarker} The red lines on the, um, graph are the um, relations between the different um, classes. Like, a user has like, a query, and then, also has, you know um, reference slots to its preferences, um, the special needs and, you know, money, and the user interest. And so this is more or less similar to the flat Bayes - net that I have, you know, with the input nodes and all that. And {disfmarker} So I tried to construct the dependency models, and a lot of these stuff I got from the flat Bayes - net, and what they depend on, and it turns out, you know, the CPT's are really big, if I do that, so I tried to see how I can do, um {disfmarker} put in the computational nodes in between. And what that would look like in a PRM. And so I ended up making several classes {disfmarker} Actually, you know, a class of {disfmarker} with different attributes that are the intermediate nodes, and one of them is like, time affordability money affordability, site availability, and the travel compatibility. And so some of these classes are {disfmarker} s some of these attributes only depend on stuff from, say, the user, or s f just from, I don't know, like the site. S like, um, these here, it's only like, user, but, if you look at travel compatibility for each of these factors, you need to look at a pair of, you know, what the um, preference of the user is versus, you know, what type of an event it is, or you know, which form of transportation the user has and whether, you know, the onsite parking matters to the user, in that case. And that makes the scenario a little different in a PRM, because, um, then you have one - user objects and potentially you can have many different sites in {disfmarker} in mind. And so for each of the site you'll come up with this rating, of travel compatibility. And, they all depend on the same users, but different sites, and that makes a {disfmarker} I'm tr I w I wa have been trying to see whether the PRM would make it more efficient if we do inferencing like that. And so, I guess you end up having fewer number of nodes than in a flat Bayes - net, cuz otherwise you would {disfmarker} c well, it's probably the same. But um, No, you would definitely have {disfmarker} be able to re - use, like, {vocalsound} um, all the user stuff, and not {disfmarker} not having to recompute a lot of the stuff, because it's all from the user side. So if you changed sites, you {disfmarker} you can, you know, save some work on that. But, you know, in the case where, it depends on both the user and the site, then I'm still having a hard time trying to see how um, using the PRM will help. Um, so anyhow, using those intermediate nodes then, this {disfmarker} this would be the class that represent the intermediate nodes. And that would {disfmarker} basically it's just another class in the model, with, you know, references to the user and the site and the time. And then, after you group them together this {disfmarker} no the dependencies would {disfmarker} of the queries would be reduced to this. And so, you know, it's easier to specify the CPT and all. Um, so I think that's about as far as I've gone on the PRM stuff.
Professor F: Well
Grad D: Right.
Professor F: No. So y you didn't yet tell us what the output is.
Grad D: The output.
Professor F: So what decisions does this make?
Grad D: OK. So it only makes two decisions, in this model. And one is basically how desirable a site is meaning, um, how good it matches the needs of a user. And the other is the mode of the visit, whether th It's the EVA decision. Um, so, instead of um, {vocalsound} doing a lot of, you know, computation about, you know, which one site it wants of {disfmarker} the user wants to visit, I'll come {disfmarker} well, try to come up with like, sort of a list of sites. And for each site, you know, where {disfmarker} h how {disfmarker} how well it fits, and basically a rating of how well it fits and what to do with it. So. Anything else I missed?
Professor F: So that was pretty quick. She's ac uh uh Eva's got a little write - up on it that uh, probably gives the {disfmarker} the details to anybody who needs them. Um, so the {disfmarker} You {disfmarker} you didn't look at all yet to see if there's anybody has a implementation.
Grad D: No, not yet, um {disfmarker}
Professor F: OK. So one {disfmarker} so one of the questions, you know, about these P R Ms is
Grad D: Mm - hmm.
Professor F: uh, we aren't gonna build our own interpreter, so if {disfmarker} if we can't find one, then we uh, go off and do something else and wait until s one appears. Uh, so one of the things that Eva's gonna do over the next few weeks is see if we can track that down. Uh, the people at Stanford write papers as if they had one, but, um, we'll see. So w Anyway. So that's a {disfmarker} a major open issue. If there is an interpreter, it looks like you know, what Eva's got should run and we should be able to actually um, try to solve, you know, the problems, to actually take the data, and do it. Uh, and we'll see. Uh, I actually think it is cleaner, and the ability to instantiate, you know, instance of people and sites and stuff, um, will help in the expression. Whether the inference gets any faster or not I don't know. Uh, it wouldn't surprise me if it {disfmarker} if it doesn't.
Grad D: Mm - hmm.
Professor F: You know, it's the same kind of information. I think there are things that you can express this way which you can't express in a normal belief - net, uh, without going to some incredible hacking of {disfmarker} sort of rebuilding it on the fly. I mean, the notion of instantiating your el elements from the ontology and stuff fits this very nicely and doesn't fit very well into the extended belief - net. So that was one of the main reasons for doing it. Um. I don't know. So, uh, people who have thought about the problem, like Robert i it looked to me like if {comment} Eva were able to come up with a {vocalsound} you know, value for each of a number of uh, sites plus its EVA thing, that a travel planner should be able to take it from there. And {disfmarker} you know, with some other information about how much time the person has and whatever, and then plan a route.
Grad B: Um - hmm, um, {vocalsound} well, first of all uh, uh, great looks, mu much cleaner, nnn, nnn, Certain {disfmarker} certain beauty in it, so, um, if beauty is truth, then, uh we're in good shape. But, the um, as, uh, mentioned before we probably should look at t the details. So if you have a write - up then uh, I'd love to read it
Grad D: Mm - hmm.
Grad B: and uh {disfmarker} because, um, i Can you go all the way back to the {disfmarker} the very top?
Grad D: Yeah.
Grad B: Um, {vocalsound} uh these {disfmarker} @ @ {comment} these {disfmarker} w w when these are instantiated they take on the same values? that we had before?
Grad D: I can't really see the whole thing.
Grad B: or are they {disfmarker} have they changed, in a sense?
Grad D: Well I think I basically leave them to similar things.
Grad B: Uh - huh.
Grad D: Some of the things might {disfmarker} that might be different, maybe like {disfmarker} are that the hours for the site.
Grad B: Hmm.
Grad D: And, eventually I meant that to mean whether they're open at this hour or not.
Grad B: Uh - huh.
Grad D: And status would be, you know, more or less like, whether they're under construction, and {disfmarker} and {disfmarker} or stuff like that.
Grad B: And the, uh, other question I would have is that presumably, from the way the Stanford people talk about it, you can put the probabilities also on the relations. If {disfmarker}
Grad D: Which is the structural uncertainty?
Professor F: Yeah. Yeah, I {disfmarker} that's {disfmarker} That I think was actually in the previous {disfmarker} the Ubenth stuff. I don't remember whether they carried that over to this or not,
Grad A: Mmm.
Professor F: uh, structural uncertainty.
Grad B: It's sort of in the definition or {disfmarker} in the {disfmarker} in Daphne's definition of a PRM is that classes and relations,
Professor F: OK.
Grad B: and you're gonna have CPT's over the classes and their relations.
Professor F: Alright.
Grad B: More uncertainty, or {disfmarker} or {disfmarker}
Professor F: Uh,
Grad B: I should say.
Grad D: I remember them learning when, you know, you don't know the structure for sure,
Professor F: Yeah.
Grad D: but I don't remember reading how you specify
Grad B: Yeah, that would be exactly my question.
Professor F: Right.
Grad D: wh to start with. Yeah.
Grad B: Well {disfmarker}
Grad D: Yeah.
Professor F: Yeah. So, uh, the {disfmarker} the plan is {disfmarker} is when Daphne gets back, we'll get in touch and supposedly, um, we'll actually get s deep {disfmarker} seriously connected to {disfmarker} to their work and
Grad B: Yep.
Professor F: somebody'll {disfmarker} Uh, you know {disfmarker} If it's a group meeting once a week probably someone'll go down and, whatever. So, we'll actually figure all this out.
Grad B: OK. OK. Then I think the w {vocalsound} long term perspective is {disfmarker} is pretty clear. We get rocking and rolling on this again, once we get a package, if, when, and how, then this becomes foregrounded
Grad D: Mm - hmm.
Grad B: profiled, focused, again.
Grad E: Designated?
Grad A: Of course.
Grad B: And um, until then we'll come up with a something that's {disfmarker} @ @ {comment} that's way more complicated for you. Right?
Grad D: OK.
Grad B: Because this was laughingly easy, right?
Grad D: Actually I had to take out a lot of the complicated stuff, cuz I {disfmarker} I made it really complicated in the beginning, and Jerry was like, {vocalsound}"" this is just too much"" .
Professor F: Yeah. So, um, you could, from this, go on and say suppose there's a group of people traveling together and you wanted to plan something that somehow, with some Pareto optimal uh, {vocalsound} uh, thing for {disfmarker}
Grad A: That's good. That's definitely a job for artificial intelligence.
Professor F: uh, or {disfmarker}
Grad A: Except for humans can't really solve it either, so.
Grad B: Well that's not {disfmarker} not even something humans {disfmarker} yeah.
Professor F: Right. Right. Well that's the {disfmarker} that would {disfmarker} that would be a {disfmarker} uh, you could sell it, as a {disfmarker}
Grad A: Yeah.
Professor F: OK, eh you don't have to fight about this, just give your preferences to the {disfmarker}
Grad A: And then you can blame the computer.
Professor F: w Exactly.
Grad A: So.
Grad B: Hmm. But what does it {disfmarker} uh {disfmarker} Would a pote potential result be to {disfmarker} to split up and never talk to each other again? You know.
Grad A: That should be one of them.
Grad B: Yeah.
Professor F: Yeah. Right.
Grad E: That'd be nice.
Grad A: Mmm.
Professor F: Anyway. So. So there i there are some {disfmarker} some u uh, you know, uh, elaborations of this that you could try to put in to this structure, but I don't think it's worth it now. Because we're gonna see what {disfmarker} what else uh {disfmarker} what else we're gonna do. Anyway. But uh, it's good, yeah and {disfmarker} and there were a couple other ideas of {disfmarker} of uh, things for Eva to look at in {disfmarker} in the interim.
Grad B: Good. Then, we can move on and see what Andreas has got out his sleeve. Or Andy, for that matter?
Grad C: OK. So uh, uh, well, thanks for having me here, first of all. Um, so maybe just a {disfmarker} a little background on {disfmarker} on my visit. So, uh, I'm not really involved in any project, that's uh {disfmarker} that's relevant to you uh, a at the moment, uh, the {disfmarker} the reason is really for me uh, to have an opportunity to talk to some other researchers in the field. And {disfmarker} and so I'll just n sort of give you a real quick introduction to what I'm working on, and um, I just hope that you have some comments or, maybe you're interested in it to find out more, and {disfmarker} and so I'll be uh, happy to talk to you and {disfmarker} and uh, I'd also like to find out some more and {disfmarker} and maybe I'll just walk around the office and and then {disfmarker} and ask some {disfmarker} some questions, uh, in a couple days. So I'll be here for uh, tomorrow and then uh, the remainder of uh, next week. OK, so, um, what I started looking at, uh, to begin with is just uh, content management systems uh, i i in general. So um, uh what's uh {disfmarker} Sort of the state of the art there is to um {disfmarker} uh you have a bunch of {disfmarker} of uh documents or learning units or learning objects, um, and you store meta - data uh, associate to them. So there's some international standards like the I - triple - E, uh {disfmarker} There's an I - triple - E, LON standard, and um, these fields are pretty straightforward, you have uh author information, you have uh, size information, format information and so on. Uh, but they're two uh fields that are um, more interesting. One is uh you store keywords associated with the uh {disfmarker} with the document, and one is uh, you have sort of a, um, well, what is the document about? So it's some sort of taxonomic uh, ordering of {disfmarker} of the {disfmarker} of the units. Now, if you sort of put on your semantic glasses, uh you say, well that's not all that easy, because there's an implicit um, uh, assumption behind that is that uh, all the users of this system share the same interpretation of the keyword and the same interpretation of uh, whichever taxonomy is used, and uh, I think that's a {disfmarker} that's a very {disfmarker} that's a key point of these systems and they sort of always brush over this real quickly without really elaborating much of that and uh {disfmarker} As a matter of fact, the only thing that m apparently really works out so far are library ordering codes, which are very, very coarse grain, so you have some like, science, biology, and then {disfmarker} But that's really all that we have at the moment. So I think there's a huge, um, uh need for improvement there. Now, what this uh {disfmarker} a standard like this would give us is we could um, sort of uh with a search engine just query uh, different repositories all over the world. But we can't really {disfmarker} Um, so what I'm {disfmarker} what I try to do is um, to have um, uh {disfmarker} So. So the scenario is the following, you you're working on some sort of project and you encounter a certain problem. Now, what {disfmarker} what we have at our university quite a bit is that uh, students um, try to u program a certain assignment, for example, they always run into the same problems, uh, and they always come running to us, and they'll say why's it not {disfmarker} it's not working, and we always give out the same answer, so we thought, well, it'd be nice to have a system that could sort of take care of this, and so, what I want to build is basically a {disfmarker} a smart F A Q system. Now, what you uh need to do here is you need to provide some context information which is more elaborate than"" I'm looking for this and this and this keyword."" So. And I think that I don't need to tell you this. I'm {disfmarker} I'm sure you have the same {disfmarker} when {disfmarker} when somebody utters a sentence in a certain, uh, context it, and {disfmarker} and the same sentence in another context makes a huge difference. So, I want to be able to model information like, um, so in the {disfmarker} in the context of {disfmarker} in the context of developing distributed systems, of a at a computer science school, um, what kind of software is the person using, which homework assignment is he or she working on at the moment, um, maybe what's the background of that student's um, which um, which error message was encountered. So this sort of information I think should be transmitted, uh, when a certain document is retrieved. Now, um, basically giving this um {disfmarker} Uh so we somehow need to have a formalized um, way of writing this down basically, and that's where the shared interpretation of {disfmarker} of certain terms and keywords comes in again. And, using this and some {disfmarker} some uh, knowledge about the domain I think you can do some {disfmarker} some simple inferences. Like you know that when somebody's working about {disfmarker} uh, working on {disfmarker} on servlets for example, he's using Java, cuz servlets are used {disfmarker} are written in Java. So some {disfmarker} some inferences like that, now, um, u using this you can infer more information, and you could then match this to the meta - data of um {disfmarker} off the documents you're {disfmarker} you're searching against. So, uh what I wanna do is basically have some sort of um {disfmarker} given these inputs, and then I can compute how many documents match, and use this as a metric in the search. Now, what I plan to do is I want to uh sort of do a uh {disfmarker} uh {pause} try to improve the quality of the search results, and I want to do this by having a depth uh, um, um {disfmarker} steepest descent approach. So if I knew which operating system the person was working on, would this improve my search result? And {disfmarker} and having uh, uh a symbolic formalized model of this I could simply compute that, and find out which um {disfmarker} which questions are worth um, asking. And that's what I then propagate back to the user, and {disfmarker} and sort of try to optimize the search in this way. Now, the big problem that I'm facing right now is um, it's fairly easy to hack up a system uh quickly, that {disfmarker} that works in the small domain, but the problem is obviously the scalability. And uh uh, so Robert was mentioning uh, earlier today is that uh, Microsoft for example with their printer set up program has a Bayesian network, which does exactly this, but there you face a problem that these are very hard to extend. And so, uh what I'm {disfmarker} What I try to do is basically try to model this uh, in a way that you could really combine uh, knowledge from very different sources, and {disfmarker} and um, sort of looking into some of the ideas that the semantic web community uh, came up with. Trying to {disfmarker} to have uh, an approach how to integrate s uh certain uh {disfmarker} representation of certain concepts and also some computational rules, um, what you can do with those. Um. What I'm also looking into is a probabilistic approach into this because document retrievals is a very fuzzy procedure, so it's probably not that easy to simply have a symbolic uh, computational model. That {disfmarker} that probably isn't expressive enough. So. So that's another thing, um, which I think you're also uh, uh looking into right now. And then um, uh sort of as an add - on to this whole idea, um, uh that would be now, depending on what the search engine or the content repository {disfmarker} depending on which {disfmarker} um, uh, which uh, rules and which ontologies it {disfmarker} it uses, or basically its view of the world, uh you can get very different results. So it might ma make a lot of sense to actually query a lot of different search engines. And there you could have an idea where you actually have sort of a {disfmarker} a peer to peer approach, where we're all sort of carrying around our individual bookshelves, and um, if you have a question about a homework, it's {disfmarker} probably makes sense to ask somebody who's in your class with you, sort of the guru in the certain area, rather than going to some Yahoo - like uh, search engine. So these are some of the {disfmarker} just in a nutshell, some of the ideas. And I think a lot of the {disfmarker} even though it's a {disfmarker} it's a very different domain, but I think a lot of the, um, issues are {disfmarker} are fairly similar. So. OK.
Grad A: And so some of the {disfmarker} I don't know how much you know about the larger Heidelberg project, I {disfmarker} Are you {disfmarker}
Grad C: Uh I know, yeah I know abou about it.
Grad A: So it seems like a lot of {disfmarker} some of the issues are the same. It's like, um, you know, the c context - based factors that influence how you interpret,
Grad C: Mm - hmm. Mm - hmm.
Grad A: um, s how to interpret. In {disfmarker} in this case, infer in in knowing {disfmarker} wanting to know what kinds of things to ask. We - we've kind of talked about that, but we haven't worried too much about that end of the discourse.
Grad B: Mm - hmm.
Grad A: But maybe you guys had that in the previous models.
Grad B: Well, in a {disfmarker} in one {disfmarker} t one s mmm, small difference in a {disfmarker} in a way, is that he doesn't have to come up with an answer, but he wants to point to the places w w
Grad A: Documents that have the answers.
Grad C: Yeah, so. So I'm {disfmarker} I'm not {disfmarker} I'm not building an expert {disfmarker}
Grad A: Mm - hmm.
Grad C: Uh, I want to build a smart librarian, basically
Grad A: Right. Right.
Grad C: that can point you to the right reference. I don't wanna compute the answer, so it's a little bit easier for me.
Grad B: Well. Uh, you have to s still m understand what the content says about itself, and then match it to what you think the informational needs {disfmarker}
Grad A: Mm - hmm.
Grad C: Mm - hmm.
Grad A: So you also don't have to figure out what the content is. You're just taking the keywords as a topic text, as {disfmarker}
Grad C: I {disfmarker} I assume that {disfmarker} that the there will be learning systems that {disfmarker} that tag their {disfmarker} their content.
Grad A: OK. Right.
Grad C: And um, um, m @ @ and basically what I {disfmarker} what I envision is that you {disfmarker} rather than just supplying a bunch of keywords you could basically {disfmarker} for {disfmarker} for an FAQ for example you could state sort of like a logic condition, when this document applies. So"" this document explains how to set up your uh, mail account on Linux"" or something like this.
Grad A: Mm - hmm.
Grad C: So. So something {disfmarker} something very specific that you can then {disfmarker} But the {disfmarker} I think that the key point with these uh, learning systems is that uh, a learning system is only as good as uh the amount of content it {disfmarker} it carries.
Grad A: Mmm, mm - hmm.
Grad C: You can have the best learning system with the best search interface, if there's no content inside of it, it's not very useful. So I think ultimately because um, uh developing these {disfmarker} these rules and these inference uh {disfmarker} inferences I think is very costly, so um, uh I think you must be able to reuse some {disfmarker} some existing um, domain {disfmarker} domain information, or {disfmarker} or {disfmarker} or ontologies that {disfmarker} that uh other people wrote and then try to integrate them, and then also search the entire web basically, rather than just the small uh, content management system.
Grad A: OK. Mm - hmm.
Grad C: So I think that's {disfmarker} that's crucial for {disfmarker} for the success of {disfmarker} or @ @ {disfmarker}
Grad A: So, you're not {disfmarker} I guess I'm trying to figure out how {disfmarker} how it maps to the kinds of things that we've talked about in this group, and, actually associated groups,
Grad C: Mm - hmm.
Grad A: cuz some of us do pretty detailed linguistic analyses, and I'm guessing that you {disfmarker} you won't be doing that? OK.
Grad C: No.
Grad A: Just checking. So, {vocalsound} OK.
Grad B: Hmm.
Grad C: No.
Grad A: So, you take the query, and {disfmarker} and {disfmarker}
Professor F: On the other hand, uh, FrameNet could well be useful. So do you know the FrameNet story?
Grad C: Um, yeah. Uh, not {disfmarker} not too much,
Professor F: OK.
Grad C: but uh,
Professor F: Oh. Th - that's another thing you might wanna look into while you're here.
Grad C: I have a rough overview.
Professor F: Because, um, you know, the standard story is that keyworks {disfmarker} keywords evoke frames, and the frames may well give you additional keywords or uh, if you know that {disfmarker} that {disfmarker} that a {disfmarker} a bunch of keywords uh, indicate a frame, then you can find documents that actually have the whole frame, rather th than just uh, individual {disfmarker}
Grad C: Mmm. Mmm.
Professor F: So there's a lot of stuff, and people are looking at that. Most of the work here is just trying to get the frames right. There's linguists and stuff and there's a lot of it and they're {disfmarker} they're busily working away. But there are some application efforts trying to exploit it. And this looks t it seems to be that this is a place where you might be able to do that.
Grad C: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I'm sure I could learn a lot about um, yeah, just how to {disfmarker} how to come up with these structures,
Grad A: Mmm.
Grad C: cuz it's {disfmarker} it's very easy to whip up something quickly, but it maybe then makes sense to {disfmarker} to me, but not to anybody else, and {disfmarker} and if we want to share and integrate things, they must {disfmarker} well, they must be well designed really.
Grad B: Remember the uh, Prashant story?
Professor F: Right.
Grad B: The absolutely no {disfmarker} no linguistic background person that the IU sent over here.
Professor F: Right.
Grad B: And Andreas and I tried to come up wi or we had come up actually with a eh {disfmarker} with him working on an interface for FrameNet, as it was back then, that would p do some of the work for this machine,
Professor F: Right. Yeah.
Grad B: which uh, never got done because Prashant found a happy occupation
Professor F: W yeah, I know, I mean it {disfmarker} it {disfmarker} he {disfmarker} w he did w what {disfmarker} what he did was much more s sensible for him.
Grad B: which in the {disfmarker} Absolutely. Yeah.
Professor F: I think uh,
Grad B: But so {disfmarker} I'm just saying, the uh, we had that idea
Professor F: you know {disfmarker} Yeah. The idea was there. Yeah, OK.
Grad B: uh to {disfmarker} to exploit FrameNet there as well.
Professor F: Yeah.
Grad A: Hmm.
Grad B: And um.
Professor F: Yeah, actually you guys never {disfmarker}
Grad B: And Srini's doing information extraction also, right?
Professor F: Right.
Grad B: with that FrameNet base.
Grad C: Mmm.
Professor F: Yeah.
Grad B: Mm - hmm.
Professor F: So you {disfmarker} you guys never sent anybody else from I U.
Grad C: Except {disfmarker} except Prashant?
Professor F: You were y no {disfmarker} Yeah.
Grad C: Um,
Professor F: Uh, this was supposedly an exchange program, and {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} we {disfmarker} you know, it's fine. We don't care, but it just {disfmarker} I'm a little surprised that uh, Andreas didn't come up with anyone else he wanted to send.
Grad A: Hmm.
Grad C: Uh I don't know, I mean the uh {disfmarker}
Professor F: Alright. I mean I had forgotten a I {disfmarker} To be honest with you, I'd totally forgotten we had a program.
Grad B: Uh it's in the program?
Grad C: Uh I {disfmarker} I think it's {disfmarker} it's really the lack of students uh, at IU at the moment.
Professor F: Yeah. Yeah. No, no. There was a whole co There was a little contract signed. It was {disfmarker} Yeah.
Grad C: Yeah, yeah. I think it's ju it's more the lack of {disfmarker} of students, really, and w we have all these sponsors that are always sort of eager to get some teams.
Professor F: Yeah, I know.
Grad A: Mmm.
Professor F: Right.
Grad C: But {disfmarker}
Professor F: Right.
Grad C: Well I mean if {disfmarker} if I were a student, I'd love to come here, rather than work for some German {vocalsound} {nonvocalsound} company, or {disfmarker}
Professor F: Yeah. Right.
Grad B: You are being recorded right now, so beware.
Professor F: Oh, right!
Grad C: Well, I didn't say anybody to {disfmarker} anything to offend {disfmarker} well, except for the sponsors maybe, but {disfmarker}
Professor F: Right. Anyway. Right. So I thi tha that's {disfmarker} that's one of the things that might be worth looking into while you're here.
Grad C: Mm - hmm.
Professor F: Uh, unfortunately, Srini, who is heavily involved in DAML and all this sort of stuff is himself out of town.
Grad C: Mm - hmm. Well I'll go to the uh, Semantic Web Workshop, uh, in two weeks.
Professor F: Right, and {disfmarker} Yeah, for {disfmarker} for some reason he's not doing that.
Grad A: Yeah. Well, he had other things to do.
Professor F: I don't know why he @ @ {disfmarker} oh, I, who knows?
Grad A: The uh {disfmarker}
Professor F: Anyway, s yeah, you'll see {disfmarker} you'll certainly see a lot of the people there.
Grad A: The other person I thought of is Dan Gildea? because he did some work on topic spotting
Professor F: Yeah. St - statistical stuff. That would be a very good idea.
Grad A: w um, which is, I mean, you {disfmarker} I mean. I don't {disfmarker} Depending on how well you wanna integrate with that end,
Grad C: Mm - hmm.
Grad A: you know, like, taking the data and fig you said the learning systems that figure out {disfmarker} We {disfmarker} There's someone in ICSI who actually has been working on {disfmarker} has worked on that kinda stuff, and he's worked with frame net, so you could talk to him about, you know, both of those things at once.
Grad C: Mm - hmm. Mm - hmm.
Grad A: So. And he just finished writing a draft of his thesis. So. I u {vocalsound} Dan Gildea, GILDEA.
Grad C: So, uh, who is that again?
Grad A: And, he's in one of the rooms on the fifth floor and stuff,
Grad B: Who? I can take you to his office.
Grad A: and {disfmarker}
Grad B: It's just around the corner.
Grad C: OK, great.
Grad A: Hmm. Well, if you fal solve the problem, {vocalsound} hope you can do one for us too.
Professor F: Alright, was there anything else for this? One of these times soon we're gonna hear about construal.
Grad B: Yeah. I'm sure. I have um {disfmarker} I think it was November two thousand three or some {disfmarker} No. Wh - I had something in my calendar.
Professor F: Oh, OK. Right.
Grad B: Um,
Grad E: Wait a second. That's a long way away.
Professor F: Good thinking!
Grad B: Uh well, maybe I can {disfmarker} I can bribe my way out of this. So. So I did some double checking and it seems like spring break in two thousand {vocalsound} one.
Grad A: Talk about changing the topic.
Grad B: No.
Professor F: Well, no, but he's {disfmarker} he's {disfmarker} he's {disfmarker} he's {disfmarker} as you said, he's, like the state legislature, he's trying to offer us bribes.
Grad A: At least this is a private meeting. Right, exactly, OK, that's the link.
Grad B: This uh {disfmarker} Oh, they refused the budget again? Is it {disfmarker} so about CITRIS? Yeah, still nothing.
Professor F: Uh, this {disfmarker} this {disfmarker} this {disfmarker} t the s we're, uh, involved in a literally three hundred million dollar uh, program. Uh, with the State of California. And, the State of California is now a month and a half behind its legis its legally required date to approve a budget. So the budget has not been approved. And two days ago {disfmarker} There's two l you know, so, two branches of legislature. One branch approved it,
Grad C: Mm - hmm.
Professor F: and, um, yesterdayday {comment} there was this uh {disfmarker} uh I thought that the other branch would just approve it, but now there's actually a little back sliding to people who {disfmarker} who approved it got flak from there, eh anyway. So, um {disfmarker} Oh! I have to tell you a wonderful story about this, OK? And then we'll go. So, I {disfmarker} it turns out I wound up having lunch today with a guy named Tom Kalil. KILL {disfmarker} KALIL. And, uh, he now works at Berkeley. In fact he's hired to run a lot of CITRIS, even though we don't have the money they {disfmarker} So they've been hiring people right and left, so, uh, they think the money's coming. So {disfmarker} and he was, I think, the chief staffer to Clinton on technology matters. He was in the White House, I don't remember what he was saying. A anyway, like that. And, is now doing all the politics for CITRIS, but also, has a uh, a lot of interest in uh, actually doing things for society, so digital divide and stuff like that. So that's s interesting to me but maybe not to you. But the really interesting thing was, he st he s he s said something about, you know I'm interested in things that have high social multiplier, something that is of great social value. He said,"" for example"" , this was his only example,"" if you had a adult literacy program that was as good as an individual tutor, and as compelling as a video game, then that would have a huge social impact"" . I said,"" Oh great! That's a good problem to work on."" Anyway. So it was nice that uh, he's got this view, of A, that's what you should try to do, and B, uh, language would be a good way to do it.
Grad A: Mmm. Definitely.
Professor F: So that's {disfmarker} So anyway, that's the end of the story.
Grad A: But for adults and not for the children.
Professor F: This was {disfmarker} Yeah. I didn't push him on the ch on the child thing,
Grad A: Uh - huh.
Professor F: but, uh, you know, a again, if {disfmarker} if you {disfmarker} if you
Grad A: Oh.
Professor F: um, and this was {disfmarker} this was literacy, which actually is somewhat different problem.
Grad A: Mm - hmm.
Professor F: Maybe easier. I don't know. So this is reading, rather than teaching {disfmarker} Another project we started on, and {disfmarker} and didn't get funded for was, uh, to try to build an automatic tutoring program, for kids whose first language wasn't English. Which is like half the school population in California. Something like that,
Grad A: Mm - hmm.
Professor F: isn't it? Yeah. So, enormous problem in California, and the idea was if we're so smart about language understanding and speech understanding, couldn't we build {vocalsound} uh, programs that would be tutors for the kids. We think we could. Anyway. So {disfmarker} so {disfmarker} But this is a slightly different problem,
Grad A: Mm - hmm.
Professor F: and um, I know none of us have the spare time to look at it right now, but it i it's {disfmarker} it's interesting and I may um, talk to him some more about is em somebody already doing this, and stuff like that. So anyway, that was {disfmarker} that was today's little story.
Grad E: Hmm.
Grad B: OK. So I {disfmarker} I did manage to get {disfmarker} pull my head out of the sling by sidetracking into CITRIS,
Professor F: No, no.
Grad B: but uh or {disfmarker} a temporarily putting it out of the sling
Professor F: Right.
Grad B: but, I {disfmarker} I'll volunteer to put it right back in by stating that I am n uh among some other things in the process of writing up stuff that we have been discussing at our daily meetings,
Professor F: Yeah.
Grad B: and also revising, thanks for all the comments, the c the original construal proposal. And, if I put one and one together, I may end up with a number that's greater than one and that I {disfmarker} I can potentially present once you get back.
Grad A: Greater than two?
Professor F: You're good.
Grad B: Nnn. {comment} s sometimes, you know the sum is not uh less than the {disfmarker}
Grad A: Uh, right, right.
Professor F: Right. Right. Anyway. Yeah, so {disfmarker} OK, so that'd be great, but I'd {disfmarker} I think it's {disfmarker} it's time again, right?
Grad B: Absolutely. Yeah.
Professor F: Yeah. OK.
Grad B: But um, and hopefully all sidetracking um, other things will have disappeared, soon.
Professor F: Good. Yep. Done?","The first phase of the data collection has finished. There is a new wizard for phase two, during which subjects will be given more complex scenarios. An alternative representation of the Bayes-net, it depicts context features as classes, and dependencies as relations between them. Following this, a visiting researcher presented an overview of a parallel project at the International University. It attempts to build a smart tutoring system for a computer science course. The assumption is that document searches can give more personalised results, if they take into account contextual parameters (user, situation). There were also further suggestions for meetings with ICSI researchers.",qmsum
"Summarize the discussion about legislation and sports infrastructural construction to make a healthy environment.
Lynne Neagle AM: Good morning, everyone. Welcome to the Children, Young People and Education Committee. We've received apologies for absence from Michelle Brown and Jack Sargeant; there are no substitutions. Can I ask if Members have any declarations of interest, please? No. Okay. We'll move on, then, to item 2, which is our scrutiny of the'Healthy Weight: Healthy Wales'draft strategy, and I'm very pleased to welcome Dr Frank Atherton, the Chief Medical Officer for Wales, and Nathan Cook, who is the head of the healthy and active branch at Welsh Government. Thank you, both, for attending this morning. We're very much looking forward to hearing what you've got to say. If you're happy, we'll go straight into questions. If I can just start by asking about the fact that'Healthy Weight: Healthy Wales'is an all-age strategy, really, and how confident you are that it will deliver for children and young people.
Dr Frank Atherton: Well, we're very confident. I mean, it has to, quite clearly. We do need to think about the present generation, the problems faced by the current generation. We have high prevalence of overweight and obesity among adults--we know that, and we can't walk away from that because that's translating into demand on health services. But we have to take a focus, a future generation's focus, almost, on the next generation. I don't write off the current generation, we can't afford to do that, but we do need to think about what can we do that would be different for the next generation so that they don't get into the sorts of problems that we're currently seeing with overweight and obesity. We know that the consequences of that for our young people are going to be enormous if we don't do something and something quite soon. We know that overweight children go on to become overweight adults, unfortunately, and that brings all the consequences of multiple disease issues--diabetes is often cited--cancer risk et cetera. So, we have to focus on children, and, in fact, during the consultation, we've been very clear that we need to engage with children and young people as well. Perhaps we'll get into that at some point, Chair, but, yes, I can give you that assurance.
Lynne Neagle AM: Okay, thank you. What my follow-up question, really, is: can you just tell us what kind of engagement you've had with children and young people to inform the draft strategy?
Dr Frank Atherton: Well, Nathan may be able to influence some of the detail, but in broad terms, we have discussed with young people in a number of fora. In fact, I was delighted that we had a young person, Evie Morgan, a schoolgirl from mid Wales, who came to the joint launch on the consultation. She met the Minister there and gave a very good personal account of her views on obesity and overweight. We've been visiting a number of schools during the consultation process. I'm visiting a school, either this week or next week, at Treorchy, to talk with teachers and young people there. Obviously, we're hopeful that schools and young people will contribute to the consultation as well. So, we've had quite good input, I would say, from children and young people. There is always more we can do we and we want to hear those voices.
Nathan Cook: I was going to say, we've also had a session with youth ambassadors as well, and what we've actually produced for the consultation is not just the children and young people's version, but also a toolkit in terms of getting schools really engaged and involved in terms of the work that we want them to do to feed into this as well. So, we've already had some really good responses from a lot of youth group and schools already.
Lynne Neagle AM: And you've got a structured programme, have you, to roll that out? Okay. Thank you. We've got some questions now on leadership, and the first questions are from Sian Gwenllian.
Sian Gwenllian AM: Good morning. I'll be speaking in Welsh. The Minister for health said yesterday, in answering a question from me on the Chamber floor, that you gave him advice not to have a target in terms of reducing obesity among children. Could you confirm that that's what your advice was and tell us why you don't think that a target is needed?
Dr Frank Atherton: My advice was not that we don't need a target--we may well need a target, and that's one of the issues we need to consult on--but that the target that had been adopted in England and in Scotland to halve the prevalence of obesity in children was more aspirational than deliverable, and that if we are to choose a target in Wales, then we need to balance deliverability with challenge. We need a challenging environment. So, there is something about performance management, because I would be looking to not just the health system but the health and care system and to public services boards to think about how they're delivering on this, and I think we can use targets to that. But they are one tool in the box that I would think we could use, and part of the consultation is to ask that question--'If we are to go down a route in Wales of choosing a target, what might that look like?'Sian Gwenllian AM: Okay. So, to be clear, you're not ruling out that maybe we would need a target.
Dr Frank Atherton: It's certainly something that we could consider in terms of the final strategy.
Sian Gwenllian AM: And is that your opinion too?
Nathan Cook: Yes.
Sian Gwenllian AM: Okay. Well, that is contrary to what I was told yesterday on the floor of the Chamber by the Minister, but there we go. I'm glad to hear that you're not ruling out having a target, because without a target, without something to aim for, how do we know that we're getting there?
Dr Frank Atherton: I think your point about evaluation is really important. Whatever we produce at the end of this process--and we're looking to produce a final strategy towards the autumn--we do need to have a strong evaluation. So, some metrics in there, it would seem, would be appropriate, but what those are, what the nature of those are, do we frame them as targets or ambitions--that's the point we need to consult on.
Sian Gwenllian AM: Okay. And the other point, of course, is the investment. If the Government is going to be successful in terms of the aim of reducing childhood obesity, then it needs to fund and support the actions. Have you made an assessment of the level of investment needed to implement this plan?
Dr Frank Atherton: Resourcing will be important. We currently do make investments in a number of areas that relate to child health generally, and, of course, obesity and overweight in particular. So, the question of resourcing is important. Now, we can't quantify an absolute amount of resource that will be needed to deliver until we know exactly what's going to come out of the consultation and what actions we might want to deliver to a greater degree in Wales. A figure of PS8 million to PS10 million a year has been banded around as a broad kind of area of what we might need to invest, but that would need to be drawn from existing programmes. We need to look at existing programmes, how effective they are. Can we make them more effective? Can we get better value from them? And there may well be a case for new investment, and that's a question, of course, that would need to be discussed with Ministers when we're producing the final strategy.
Nathan Cook: But I think a key consideration as well is we already know there is investment across health boards in some kind of obesity-related services. So, I think what we really need to think about across Wales is how we can drive greater scale, how we can look at current programmes in terms of making sure that they're better evaluated, and how we can make sure that we're also drawing up on the existing resources and capacity out there as well.
Sian Gwenllian AM: And does the level of investment depend on what the target is--what the goal is?
Dr Frank Atherton: I don't think you can necessarily just link the two. The issue of resourcing is one that's there irrespective of whether we choose to put a target in place.
Sian Gwenllian AM: But how would we know that it's being used effectively if there isn't something to aim for?
Dr Frank Atherton: Which brings you back to the question about evaluation. We need proper evaluation of the various programmes that we have.
Sian Gwenllian AM: Yes, but without a target, how can you properly evaluate? If you don't know what you're trying to do, how can you properly evaluate? Anyway, you're open to suggestions about having a target, which is great. Would you agree that Government could use the revenue that's being produced through the levy on soft drinks towards some of these efforts to--?
Dr Frank Atherton: Well, of course, there are some consequentials that are coming to the Welsh Government as part of the levy on sugary soft drinks. That funding, of course, is less than we had anticipated, and that reflects, actually, a success story because industry is reformulating, and so the amount of sugar in soft drinks is already starting to decrease, which is a good thing. But to your question: should we use the funding? Well, of course we should use funding. I'm not personally in favour of hypothecation, I think I'm more interested in the totality of resource that goes into public health programmes than into marginal resource. There are, of course, a number of initiatives that we currently fund through the general revenue. And when I think about obesity, I don't just think about the relatively small marginal amounts of money that come in through whatever source, but I think about the totality of the PS7 billion we spend in health and social care and how we can divert and channel some of that towards broad prevention initiatives in general, and towards tackling being overweight and obesity in particular.
Sian Gwenllian AM: You're saying that it's less than expected. Could you give us any kind of figure?
Dr Frank Atherton: I'm sorry, could you repeat the question?
Sian Gwenllian AM: You say that there is less money that's come in through these consequentials from the levy, can you mention some sort of figure?
Dr Frank Atherton: The figure that I have in mind is about PS56 million that's coming in in terms of revenue over a two-year period. But I'd have to confirm that with the committee. What the anticipated--. When the sugar levy was first brought in, there was some modelling at UK level about what level of revenue that would bring, but it was based on the amount of sugar that was currently then in drinks and the fact that the sugar has reduced in drinks, I mean, the total amount available to the UK is less and hence our consequentials are less. Nathan may have some precise figures.
Nathan Cook: Yes, I was going to say, there was a mid-year report done where the levy has raised PS150 million to date since coming into force in April, and the original forecast was PS520 million a year. So, I think that shows the amount of work that's been done by industry around reformulation.
Sian Gwenllian AM: And the consequentials of that? That is the consequential--PS150 million.
Nathan Cook: On a UK level.
Sian Gwenllian AM: Yes, so what's the Welsh consequential?
Lynne Neagle AM: Fifty-six.
Sian Gwenllian AM: Fifty-six? Gosh, that sounds a lot. Anyway, it's a good sum of money and you're talking about investing PS8 million to PS10 million. So, obviously, you know, we can be more ambitious because there is money in that pot if that money was ring-fenced for this particular scheme.
Dr Frank Atherton: Well, the resource is going to be a real issue that we need to address, and I think as Nathan has said, there is funding of various initiatives currently in the system, and we need to look at that and make that as effective as possible. Will there be a need for some additional resource? There may well be, and that's a question that we'll have to look at in terms of the strategy when we develop it and have a discussion with Ministers about the level of resourcing.
Lynne Neagle AM: Can I just ask on that before Sian moves on? What assessment have you made of how that money is being spent in other UK nations? Because my understanding is that the money is being used in other UK nations to directly impact on obesity. Have you given any consideration to--? As I understand it, that money now is being dispersed around a plethora of programmes, including the transformation programme, and what I found very odd, really, was vaccination, which is surely the core business of the NHS. Have you got any view on that?
Dr Frank Atherton: I'm not sure I understand your point, Chair, in terms of the link between the consequentials from--. Are you talking about the consequentials from the sugar levy or are you talking about--?
Lynne Neagle AM: Yes, because in other nations, it is being used to directly impact on initiatives to tackle obesity, whereas, we've kind of put it here in Wales into the general pot and it's being used to fund a plethora of different things.
Dr Frank Atherton: Well, that cuts to what I was talking about. My preference--it's a personal view--is that hypothecation doesn't really help us too much. I mean, what we need to look at is whether the programmes, the sorts of programmes that are being funded in England, or indeed in Scotland, are working effectively, and if they are, are they being delivered here in Wales? We have looked very carefully at the plans that England and Scotland have for tackling obesity and overweight, and we've made a comparison with what we're doing in Wales, and our ambition in Wales is to go further than those nations, in many ways. But I come back to the point that just linking the hypothecation of a relatively small amount of resource is likely to be less impactful than asking a question of public services boards and of the health system, indeed, about how much money, overall, are we putting into prevention.
Lynne Neagle AM: No, I recognise that, and I think we're talking about additional resource. Suzy.
Suzy Davies AM: I was just wondering whether you thought that there was a useful psychological link on the part of the public between saying,'Here's a sugar levy', and'It's going to be used to help children and adults stay healthier.'Going into a pot, it actually makes it quite difficult to explain the purpose of the tax in the first place. So, I take your overall point, but in terms of the people who we're trying to help in all this, actually creating a direct link might be quite helpful.
Dr Frank Atherton: You may be right. I'm not a behavioural psychologist. We'd have to ask--
Suzy Davies AM: Neither am I. I'm a person who eats a lot of sugar. [Laughter. ]
Dr Frank Atherton: Your point's taken.
Suzy Davies AM: Thank you.
Lynne Neagle AM: Thanks. Sian.
Sian Gwenllian AM: The last question from me, about partnership working. You're putting an emphasis on the whole-system approach in implementing the plan, how are you going to create a system that co-ordinates action and drives change across relevant partners, avoiding a situation where it's everyone's role, but nobody's responsibility? How are you going to avoid that?
Dr Frank Atherton: It's a very important question, and one of the four strands in the consultation is exactly related to that, around leadership and drive nationally. I'm not interested in producing a strategy that sits on a shelf. If you look around the world, there are plenty of obesity strategies. You may notice, by the way, that we've chosen not to talk about an obesity strategy but a healthy weight strategy, because I think having a positive construct is really quite important to us here in Wales. But leadership will be really important, and we will need some sort of structure to lead this, to provide oversight. I'm not a great believer in creating new structures, so we do need something that will give that drive, but the leadership comes from the top down. We need political commitment to this, and that's why I welcome the input from this committee. So, that needs to be assured. And then we need to make sure that the public sector generally is engaged in this, but it goes way beyond the public sector, of course, because we have to work with industry, and we have to work with communities, and we have to work with the public on this. So we need to think about our governance system for this and how we drive it forward. Interestingly, we had quite a large discussion two days ago between health and social care, but also involving the third sector and some members of the public, around how can we drive prevention more generally. It wasn't specifically on obesity, but of course obesity came up because it's such a pressing issue. This question of governance was discussed quite extensively, and we do have governance systems, of course, in Wales. We have public services boards, we have regional partnership boards, and how we can get those aligned behind this common agenda is really important. But I'd like to see--and I know I'm a public health professional, so I know that only maybe 10 per cent, 15 per cent, possibly 20 per cent of what makes and keeps us healthy as individuals and as communities can be driven through the health system; but I would like the system to step up and take these kinds of issues more seriously as well. So I'd be looking for local leadership through directors of public health and indeed through chief executives to work with their public services boards on this. So, we'll need some sort of national oversight, absolutely, but we need local ownership and local leadership, too.
Lynne Neagle AM: Thank you. We've got some questions now from Janet Finch-Saunders.
Janet Finch-Saunders AM: Thank you, Chair. Delivery of the plan will be led by a national implementation board that will be accountable to Ministers. Which Minister do you believe it should be accountable to, or, given the complexity of obesity, should the board be directly accountable to the First Minister?
Dr Frank Atherton: Ultimately, the First Minister will be responsible for this and will want to have a strong oversight of this. It is often framed as a health issue, and the Minister, Vaughan Gething, has a strong personal commitment to this, I know. We've talked extensively with him and with sports and recreation colleagues about that, so there's a link there. It does cut across all portfolios, and so this is an issue that I have discussed with Cabinet, and that collective ownership is really important, and will be, because it can't just sit in one domain. I think what you do need to have is you do need to have a lead organisation or a lead ministry, and I would see health as--I work within health, so I'm perhaps biased, but I would see health as leading this, but it needs broad ownership across Government.
Janet Finch-Saunders AM: I know my colleague Sian Gwenllian mentioned earlier targets and things, but I know in Wales we're not too good at collecting data. What data is currently available on childhood obesity and what metrics will be used to measure progress against the plan's objectives?
Dr Frank Atherton: Well, of course, our main data source is the child measurement programme, which collects information on children entering school aged four or five. That's our main source of information. If we look at that data, it shows us--. Well, I'm sure you're familiar with the statistics, but it'll be just under a third of children at that age who are overweight or obese--
Janet Finch-Saunders AM: Could I just ask--sorry to interrupt--how up to date is that?
Dr Frank Atherton: The last survey was just last year.
Nathan Cook: The data was published last week.
Dr Frank Atherton: Yes, the lastest data was out last week.
Janet Finch-Saunders AM: It is pretty up to date.
Dr Frank Atherton: So, it's pretty up to date, and what it shows--. It's not getting radically worse--there's always statistical variation in these things--but it's not getting any better. And, for the first time last year, we did look at the question not just of children who were overweight or obese, but we actually singled out the proportion who are obese, severely obese. So we have a figure for that for the first time, which is about 12 per cent, which is quite shocking, in a way.
Janet Finch-Saunders AM: It is shocking.
Dr Frank Atherton: So, that's our main source of information. Does that answer your question?
Janet Finch-Saunders AM: Yes, but how will any gaps in your data be addressed?
Dr Frank Atherton: Well, one of the questions that are often asked is: could we measure more on a longitudinal basis? By that I mean in England, for example, children are measured at school entry and then again at year 11--at age 11 or 12. , that kind of age group. And so you do have a longitudinal view over time of what's happening to children. I think that would be helpful to us in Wales, and it's one of the questions in the consultation about whether we should expand that. Obviously, that would have significant resource implications, not just for the funding, but also for schools and for the system to deliver it. But it's something that maybe would help us in terms of better understanding and better evaluation--the point that was made earlier.
Nathan Cook: And the other data we do have is the millennium cohort study, which has been released, for 14 and 15-year-olds. That's going to be--. We're starting to think about how we can utilise some of that data, looking at that longitudinal picture around children as well, which will be really helpful.
Janet Finch-Saunders AM: Thank you. You've answered my next question. Thank you.
Lynne Neagle AM: Can I just ask about the child measurement programme? The strategy commits to looking at whether we can have a second measurement taking place in Wales. Can you just tell us a bit more about your thinking on that and when you would see a second measurement taking place and how you would use that data?
Dr Frank Atherton: I touched on that just now, but personally I do think it would be helpful to have more information. It's always the case, There's always a trade-off between the cost of getting that information and the value of the information. So, the question of how it would be used would be really important. There is still a lot that we don't know. We know an awful lot about obesity and being overweight and the causes of it, but we don't really have a very clear understanding, in Wales at least, of the point at which children start to become overweight. Although we know that overweight children tend to go on to become overweight adults, we don't know what proportion of them between school entry and later teenage years--what those changes are. So, it would help us to have some better understanding, which would help to direct some of our initiatives. I'd be generally supportive of the principle. We'll wait and see what comes out in the consultation, and it's something that we need to give thought to, but we do have to trade off the additionality of what the information would give us with the cost of doing that, of course.
Lynne Neagle AM: Okay. Thank you. We've got some questions now on healthy environments from Dawn Bowden.
Dawn Bowden AM: Thank you, Chair. In the draft plan, some of the measures in there suggest legislating for restricting price promotions and banning energy drinks, and that sort of thing. Do you think that, if we go down that road, there's going to be time within this Assembly to introduce such legislation? And, if not, what do you think might be the timescale for such legislation?
Dr Frank Atherton: It may well be that there are things in Wales that we might wish to legislate on, and you've mentioned two of them, and they're good examples. We would, obviously, need to undertake quite detailed consultation on those and, in a way, we need to mirror what's happening in England and in Scotland to some degree around the consultations they're having on energy drinks. We also need to influence the issues that are not devolved to us and we seek to do that. As to your question of legislative time, I'm not really in a position to answer that. What I could say is that legislation may well be one of the outcomes of the consultation. There may well be things that we wish to choose to legislate on. The timing of that will have to be subject to other pressures, and I come back to the point that legislation, of course, is one of the tools that we've got--we need to deploy them all.
Dawn Bowden AM: Sure, I understand that, that you could do other things. I know--. We've heard from the Government, on other calls for legislation, that the programme's very tight, certainly for this term, so I was just wondering whether we might get that in, but okay. If I turn now to the planning system--and this might not be something that you have great deal of knowledge of; I'd just welcome your view on this, because, when we discussed with stakeholders, we talked about whether the planning system, for instance, could be used to, as an example, restrict hot food takeaways around schools and so on. Would that be a measure that you would support, something like that?
Dr Frank Atherton: I think it's definitely something we want to look at and, of course, that question is asked in the consultation, so we would like to know people's views on that. It's an interesting one. I think there is a question--a really important question--about how we can use the planning system more effectively. I've discussed with Nathan on a number of occasions, with planning colleagues in Welsh Government and in local authorities, about the art of the possible, let's say. There may be things that we could think about and we want to get those ideas through the consultation. The specific question around takeaways, particularly takeaways near schools, is often asked. I was very interested to see, up in the north-east, some time ago, that one of the local authorities up there did put a moratorium on the opening of new fast-food venues near to schools, or indeed in areas where levels of obesity and overweight were particularly high. I understand London is now--some London boroughs are now--experimenting with that as well. So, that gave me comfort, because maybe there are powers within local authorities that can be used more effectively. I think my view at the moment is that the jury's kind of out on whether those are effective and how effective they're going to be. But the fact that we have some initiatives around the UK does give us an opportunity to study that and to learn from experience perhaps and then, if it is shown to be beneficial, to think about that here in Wales, yes.
Dawn Bowden AM: Sure, because it will only be one of a suite of measures anyway. Of itself, it wouldn't address the problem, but, added to other initiatives, I guess it would. Can I just ask you briefly, then, about community sport infrastructure and, in particular, of new schools? So, Welsh Government, as you know, has ploughed a huge amount of money into the twenty-first century schools programme. What we heard when we spoke to stakeholders recently, particularly headteachers, was that, in some of the new schools that have been built, we haven't had changing rooms and toilet facilities, for instance, built into the new buildings. So, if we're going to try and utilise these buildings for general community activity to get kids and the wider public, actually, more active, do you think that's something that we ought to be building in? Again, not your particular direct area of responsibility, but something that you might have an input into, is that, when we're developing schools, we should be making sure that they have those kinds of facilities so that they become accessible to the wider public. Is that something that you would be prepared to make a recommendation around?
Dr Frank Atherton: Well, it's certainly a fascinating area and one that I think has a lot of potential. It goes--. You're right to raise it in the context of schools, and I can understand why this committee would, but I think it goes beyond that, actually, into all developments in the public sector and how they're developed and whether we're building health into our environment, which perhaps is your starting point. One of the things that I was really pleased to see in terms of the Public Health (Wales) Act 2017 that was passed a couple of years ago was the use of health impact assessment as a tool, and we're still working on how that will inform policy and how that will be applied in issues such as policy decisions through Government, but also in more downstream issues about how we create the public infrastructure that the public can and should be using. And so I would like to see the use of health impact assessments to a much greater degree to inform those kinds of decisions. If you apply that kind of lens and you take the point, which is inherent in your question, I think, that schools are not just for kids, they're for communities, then you would--it would lead you to a conclusion that you would perhaps design and build them in a different way. So, on a personal basis, I would certainly support your view that we should be looking to use the sports environment in schools in the same way as we use leisure centres. There are all kinds of barriers in there, and I understand all of that, and it's not really my field, exactly as you say, but, as a matter of principle, I think it's a good one to pursue.
Dawn Bowden AM: Okay. Thank you. And widening it out to other public services buildings as well.
Dr Frank Atherton: Indeed.
Dawn Bowden AM: Yes. Okay. Thank you.
Lynne Neagle AM: Okay, thank you. We're going to move on now to talk about how we create healthy settings. I've got some questions from Suzy Davies.
Suzy Davies AM: Thank you very much. Yes, perhaps if we could just stay in this area of education just for a moment, I think we all agree that healthy habits acquired early on probably tend to last quite well, so I wonder if you can tell us a little bit about the healthy and sustainable preschool scheme and whether you think some timescales should be made public about what you expect the achievements from that scheme to be. But, in particular, I was struck with what you said about local leadership, and I just want you to bear that in mind in answering the next question, which is about the foundation phase. You're probably aware that this committee has heard from various school leaders that they're struggling in some cases to meet the ratio of staffing for the foundation phase, which potentially compromises the purpose of it in terms of physical activity. I'm just wondering how the strategy development board is considering that at the moment. Is it something that's come on the radar for the board? Is it something you're thinking about? And, if so, who do you think should be responsible for pinning that down a little bit? Because this is education, not health, and--.
Dr Frank Atherton: Well, look, I've got to confess to you, I'm not an educationist, and so the question on staffing numbers in schools is not one that I have been asked to give a deal of consideration to, and it hasn't really been discussed, I don't believe, in the context of development of the strategy. If there is a specific point around that that the committee would like to make in terms of a response into the consultation, which I presume you'll be making, then we'd be happy to consider that. As to healthy preschools, I don't know, Nathan may have some view on that. I've not been closely involved with the work. We have standards and we perhaps need to think about how we tighten those standards and how we--enforce isn't the right word, but how we implement and make sure that those standards are properly implemented, because you're absolutely right to say that habits are developed early in life. That's in the preschool; it's also in the home of course, and then later in the school. So, we do need to look at all of those as settings and are there more things we can do within those settings to drive healthier behaviours--that's exactly why we need the consultation.
Nathan Cook: But I would say, through that scheme as well, we've really got a really good bank of preschools that are actually doing some really great work in this area as well. So, I think the more we can understand the successes that some of those environments are having--you know, how we can roll those out and work across other settings to create that wider impact as well is going to be really important.
Suzy Davies AM: Okay. Thank you. What I'm thinking about is expectations at that level will be expectations at a slightly older level, which will be contained within the foundation phase. And while you're quite right--obviously, parents have a role in this, or families--there will be, particularly with the introduction of the new curriculum, certain expectations on schools to provide not just healthy environments but to actively work towards well-being and healthy weight in children and things. And that's why I asked you about local leadership, because, if it fails for reasons that have nothing to do with the plan at foundation phase, it's going to fail further up the school years as well. I think it might be something that the board might want to consider here, because at some point there'll be an accountability question and we will want to know how'Healthy Weight: Healthy Wales'fits in with the new plans for the new curriculum, and whether it's merely persuasive and influential or whether it has the weight to place some obligations on school leaders about what they do in their schools. So, this connection, I think, is quite an important one, and, if the strategy development board could consider that, I think it would be very helpful, because this doesn't exist in a vacuum.
Dr Frank Atherton: Well, I'd certainly be delighted to take that back and we can look at it in terms of how we move from the consultation into the final strategy. It's certainly a point we can try and look at.
Suzy Davies AM: Because we will want to know who to ask:'you're the accountable person--why has something worked, or not worked?'We will need to know that at some point.
Dr Frank Atherton: Just building on Nathan's point, some of the schools--I know it's schools rather than the preschools, and I take your point, but some of the schools we've been working with have absolutely brilliant models of good practice and good local leadership. I remember the Minister actually at the launch, and one of the schools was represented there, and they presented--the school came and some of the children came and presented--to the whole audience about the activities that they were undertaking in their school around physical activity and on healthy eating, and it was such a model of good behaviour the question was,'Well, why not everywhere?', so that probably speaks to your question.
Suzy Davies AM: Okay, well, thank you for that commitment anyway.
Lynne Neagle AM: And have you had any discussions, then, with education officials around things like teacher training and CPD, because you'll be aware the Health and Social Care Committee has made a number of recommendations in this area? It's crucial that we skill up the staff to develop these things in an appropriate way, isn't it?
Dr Frank Atherton: Well, we certainly discuss with education colleagues in Welsh Government. There's more we need to do in terms of that, because you're absolutely right: there's something about building the whole of the workforce--education is really important, but elsewhere as well; it's about how do we really make every contact count, you know, that construct. So, everybody who's working in the health and social care system should have a role in this; everybody who works in education, whether it's the old--. Do we still have dinner ladies? Or teachers, you know, they have a role to play in supporting children to be as healthy as they possibly can. And, actually, I see them, Chair, as a really essential part of the public health workforce.
Lynne Neagle AM: Okay, thank you. Suzy, are you going to do your curriculum one?
Suzy Davies AM: Well, I've bound it in together, but that final point you make about teachers being part of the answer to this, they're already under a range of pressures: is it fair to make them accountable for whether this works or not? Or should that local leadership lie somewhere else? I don't expect you to pin down a person today.
Dr Frank Atherton: I wouldn't like to blame a teacher or performance manage them on the proportion of their children in their class who are overweight. That would clearly be nonsense, wouldn't it? But they are part of the solution, and so the accountability lies further up the chain, doesn't it? The question I think we would have, and public services boards might well ask, and the local education authorities may well ask, is: how effective is any particular school at driving forwards these healthy behaviours?
Suzy Davies AM: Okay, thank you. I'll leave some questions for Hefin.
Lynne Neagle AM: Hefin.
Hefin David AM: Is that all right, Chair?
Lynne Neagle AM: You've got the floor, Hefin.
Hefin David AM: Thank you, Chair. You make a commitment to embedding physical activity at an early stage in primary school education. What would that look like?
Dr Frank Atherton: Just in terms of the physical activity, I have to say it's a really important dimension and we need to move further on. We know not enough of our children are physically active and they're not meeting the various guidelines, so it's really important. It doesn't actually have as much of an impact on weight as the dietary issue. I'd just say that. It's really important for all sorts of reasons. It does have an impact on healthy weight, but it has a huge impact in terms of socialisation, in terms of mental health issues, et cetera, you know. So--I'm sorry, I've lost track of your question.
Nathan Cook: I'd just say that one thing we have got in train is, obviously, Sport Wales, Public Health Wales and Natural Resources Wales--we have them working together as a collaborative at the moment to look at how their joint delivery on physical activity can be taken forward more efficiently. So, one of the things they are looking at is obviously the schools programmes they do through eco-schools, the Welsh network of healthy schools and the sports programme to really think about that physical activity and how we can have better join up in terms of the programmes that we're already delivering as well.
Hefin David AM: With that in mind, I'm going to confess to you, chief medical officer, I did anything in school I could to avoid physical education lessons. I hated it. I didn't feel engaged with it. Yet, two weeks ago, I played for the Assembly rugby team--I wanted to get that in. The school sports survey, that would suggest that we're still not hitting those targets with children. How can we get children more engaged with physical education in ways that--? I felt completely alienated in school.
Dr Frank Atherton: Well, you're right, and many people go through that same journey and come to physical activity later in life, and that's great if they do that. The sad reality is that many people don't, and we also know that there are issues around the dropping off, particularly for girls, of physical activity towards the teenage years. So, there are specific moments that we need to understand. We do have a lot of information about these kinds of things. Public Health Wales is very good at collating the information. We do need to turn that into programmes. I mean, at the heart of it, it's about making sports and physical activity enjoyable and attractive to people. Sometimes that's easier, I sense, for boys than for girls, but we need to tailor things to different audiences.
Hefin David AM: Yes, that's the trick, isn't it? It's about finding out what children enjoy doing. That could be quite a wide and varied range of things. Is that the key?
Dawn Bowden AM: It's not all about organised team sports.
Hefin David AM: Yes. As Dawn said, it's not just about organised team sports. There are some very individual activities you could do.
Dr Frank Atherton: Absolutely, yes. And that's where I think--. I'm delighted that Sport Wales has moved beyond. It's not just about elite sports; it's about getting everybody engaged and active in sports, and that partnership with Public Health Wales that Nathan talked about is really important, because we need a population approach to driving physical activity.
Hefin David AM: So, do you think, with that in mind, we need statutory guidance for schools on physical education?
Dr Frank Atherton: Again, I'd look to the consultation as to whether there was an appetite for any kind of guidance. It may well be that that is something that could be considered.
Hefin David AM: Okay. And finally, with regard to free school meals to all pupils in primary and secondary schools, do you think that extending that to all pupils would be beneficial in providing a more varied diet for pupils?
Dr Frank Atherton: I don't have a personal view on that. I think it's the quality of the food that kids are getting, whether that comes from home or through school, and whether it's free or whether it's paid for. I think it's the quality of the food that we need to focus on. The question of children being hungry at school is a really important one and needs to be addressed at a national level. I think that's a--
Hefin David AM: So, you think that's more about the provision of food for those who might not have access to it than providing a varied diet.
Dr Frank Atherton: I think it's important that children have access to food, absolutely, if that's your question, but we also need to look at the quality of the food and what's in that food offer.
Hefin David AM: But you don't necessarily think universal provision would--.
Dr Frank Atherton: I don't have a clear view on that. I know there's a larger debate about that.
Hefin David AM: Okay, thank you.
Lynne Neagle AM: I've got some supplementaries from Janet and then Suzy.
Janet Finch-Saunders AM: Yes. I've been around some amazing schools in my own constituency, where they've got proper canteen facilities for pupils and really, really good produce in the meals. However, there's probably only a third having school meals; the rest are packed lunches. And, to be honest, I've been very surprised and shocked at what I've seen of the quality of the food in the packed lunches. Nobody can really police, and I wouldn't want to see parents being policed over what goes in a packed lunch, so if there is data out there to suggest that there's a larger percentage of parents providing packed lunched that are really not good at all, then there is some merit to be said for what Hefin is--. Me, personally, I'd love to see the introduction of universal school meals. I think it's been a very retrograde step, going backwards. Would you be willing to carry out any research?
Dr Frank Atherton: So, I mean, your point about food that's brought in in the packed lunches is a really important one, and I've talked to some headteachers as well about this. We could go down a route of guidance and prohibition, but that gets you into the role of nanny in chief and I don't really see that as my role or Government's role, and I don't think it's effective either. Do you remember--? You must have seen on tv--I think it was in Scotland; I don't know if it's happened in Wales--parents pushing the fish and chip packets through the school railings. We don't need to get into that. What I have seen, though, is some really good innovative practice in schools where, for example, they reward children for bringing the healthy options. Schools can give guidance to parents about what would be a healthy lunch and what sort of things might be expected to be seen in the lunch box. And you can reward children, and children do respond to rewards. So, I've seen some of those approaches that have transformed, actually, the offer of what comes in school boxes. But I think just banning chocolate bars and crisps in the packed lunch is unlikely to be successful.
Janet Finch-Saunders AM: We can't do that. So, my point to the question was: isn't there some merit, perhaps, about all children being equal and eating similar good-quality food in schools?
Dr Frank Atherton: Yes. That gets you back to the question about universal school meals.
Janet Finch-Saunders AM: Perhaps some of that PS56 million sugar tax, even. Who knows?
Lynne Neagle AM: Suzy.
Suzy Davies AM: Yes. Mine is just a short question. The draft plan commits, doesn't it, to updating the healthy eating in schools regulations--the 2013 regulations? I appreciate this is a consultation, but what is it that needs changing in those regulations at the moment, just to give us a bit of steer?
Nathan Cook: It's mainly on sugar content, so, obviously, they don't adhere to current Scientific Advisory Committee on Nutrition guidelines around sugar levels. So, what we'd want to consider is, you know, what we need to be careful of is unintended consequences of changing that, as well, if you see a shift to more kids bringing in school packed lunches as well. So, I think we want to consider the best way of doing that and consider through the consultation how we can go about it.
Suzy Davies AM: All right. So, it's very pertinent to Janet's question, in that way. Okay, so it's mainly about sugar, but it could be about other things as well. Okay. Thanks.
Lynne Neagle AM: Okay. The next questions are from Janet anyway; firstly, on the clinical obesity pathway.
Janet Finch-Saunders AM: The'Healthy Weight: Healthy Wales'plan commits to a review of the clinical obesity pathway. What are the time frames for this review, and what do you think are the basic essentials of a clinical obesity pathway for children and young people?
Dr Frank Atherton: We do have a pathway for managing overweight, and that's been in place since about 2010, I believe, and we do need to bring that up to date in terms of current knowledge and experiences. We've challenged Public Health Wales; we've asked Public Health Wales to undertake a review of that pathway, and they are going through that process now. I'm not sure of exactly the time frame that we have given them for that.
Nathan Cook: We were asking them to review the pathway before we launch the final strategy in October because, obviously, what we want is for that to inform what that final strategy looks like. So, we'll be looking probably early autumn for them to report back on that.
Dr Frank Atherton: The second point of your question about what are the essential elements, I mean, they are already there; we need to tweak them and we need to make sure that they're properly delivered. But it's a tiered approach, so, having access to information through schools and through communities and into families is part of the first step of that. And then, if children are overweight, it's a question about how they're identified. There are questions about the ability of the public to recognise large children, so there may be an issue there. But when children are running into issues around weight, what kind of interventions can be put in, either through primary care or through communities through health visitors, et cetera? And then of course we do have--and we've started to shine a light on this, haven't we--the very overweight children. I don't think we have enough in the way of targeted support to be able to support those. There are programmes available, but they're perhaps not universally provided. So, I think there's something about looking at our whole pathway, mapping out what the current evidence now shows us is needed, and then thinking about what is our provision in Wales and what do we need to do to bring that up to the level of the places that are the best.
Janet Finch-Saunders AM: Thank you. The draft plan recognises the importance of the first 1,000 days, but it doesn't appear to include any new proposals to help parents to enable lifestyle changes. It lists existing initiatives, such as the Healthy Child Wales programme and breastfeeding action plan. Are you satisfied that the draft plan does enough to address the influence that family and parents have on children's healthy weight behaviours, particularly in the first 1,000 days?
Dr Frank Atherton: Well, the first 1,000 days are really critically in shaping lives, as I'm sure you'd agree. We are absolutely open to any other suggestions that the public or this committee have as to what more we can and should do. There are a number of things, the sorts of programmes you've mentioned, that I think could be more effective. We're currently looking at breastfeeding because it starts before birth, actually. We know that children who are breastfed are less likely to suffer from obesity in childhood and, indeed, to go on to be obese adults. So, we do need to go further on that. We do have some programmes--Healthy Working Wales, et cetera--that need to be improved. If there are other interventions in other areas that we need to take, then we'd be delighted to hear what they are, but those are the ones that have jumped out so far.
Nathan Cook: Can I just say--? One of the proposals we're looking for is, obviously, we know that during pregnancy it's a really critical time when we can actually look to work with mothers. We know from looking at some of the behaviour change that it's actually a really critical point when new mothers really start thinking about their lives, wanting the best for their child and their families. So, what we are thinking about is how we could develop some kind of approaches to that going forward. But we know our Healthy Start scheme is also a good lever for us, just in terms of how we can look to improve that kind of dietary offer at the earliest stage as well.
Janet Finch-Saunders AM: Thank you. Finally, we know that for some families day-to-day challenges can make it difficult for them to make healthy choices, particularly for those on lower incomes and/or maybe using food banks. Could the Welsh Government take bolder action to better support low-income families to eat healthily?
Dr Frank Atherton: Well, you've touched on a really important point about inequalities because overweight and obesity is not evenly distributed across our population. It absolutely is more prevalent in more socioeconomically deprived communities, and that's something that should really concern us all. So, it gets you to questions of availability of fresh food and produce; it gets you to questions of formulation of products and whether value brands are less healthy than more premium brands. So, it cuts across all of those issues that we talked about in terms of settings and in terms of environment earlier. There is something about the affordability of good-quality healthy food that we need to think about. We do need to think in broad terms--broader terms than just obesity, but we do need to think in broad terms--about how we create a society where families have the wherewithal to lead healthy lives, and that gets you to really important questions about the minimum wage and income poverty. There's no doubt in my mind--I'm a public health professional--and there's no doubt in my mind that economic success and health success go hand in hand. So, you speak to a very deep question there. In terms of what we can do through this particular consultation, there are some things in there about providing better access, but without tackling some of those deeper determinants of health, their impact will necessarily be limited.
Janet Finch-Saunders AM: Thank you.
Lynne Neagle AM: Just finally from me, then, you referred earlier to the importance of making every contact count, but some stakeholders have told the committee that they struggle to do that because of difficulties in availability of people to refer to. Is that a situation that you recognise and what, really, can we do to improve that situation?
Dr Frank Atherton: Well, it depends what you mean as to where to refer to. So, the health system obviously needs to respond to this issue. What we're seeing across the NHS is a gradual transformation in primary care so that primary care is no longer about going to see your GP, it's about going to see a practice where you have a range of health professionals. Would I like to see more dietetic support, for example, in that setting? Absolutely I would. I think we need to think in terms of that pathway that we were talking about earlier, about access to that kind of advice and support, which can head off people getting into problems and kids getting into problems with weight issues. So, that question of redesign of the pathway really speaks to, I think, your point about,'Well, where do people go when they have problems with their weight?'That's true for adults and it's true for children as well.
Lynne Neagle AM: Okay, thank you. Are there any other questions from Members? No. Okay. Well, can I thank you both very much for your attendance? It's been a really productive session. We appreciate your time. You will be sent a transcript to check for accuracy in due course, but thank you again.
Dr Frank Atherton: We'll do that. Thank you, Chair, and thank you to the committee, because getting some input into the consultation from children's perspectives, this would be one of the routes we would absolutely welcome. Thank you.
Lynne Neagle AM: Okay, thank you very much. Item 3, then, is papers to note. Paper to note 1 is a letter from the Welsh Health Specialised Services Committee on CAMHS tier 4 provision. Paper to note 2 is a letter from the Minister for Health and Social Services also on CAMHS in-patient provision. Paper to note 3 is a letter from the Children Commissioner for Wales on tier 4 CAMHS provision. Paper to note 4 is a letter from Qualifications Wales to the Minister for Education on qualifications for the new curriculum. Paper to note 5 is a letter from me to the Minister for Education on the development of the new curriculum. Paper to note 6 is a letter from me to the Minister for Education seeking clarification on the draft additional learning needs code. Paper to note 7 is a letter from me to the Minister for Education seeking clarification on the response to our Brexit report. Paper to note 8 is a letter from the Equality and Human Rights Commission on a cumulative impact assessment briefing for committee, which has been offered. Paper to note 9 is a letter from the Chair of the Petitions Committee on a national taskforce for children's mental health. Paper to note 10 is a letter to the Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union from the children's commissioners for England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland on the implications of Brexit for children. There are a few that I'd like to return to in private, but are Members happy to note those? Thank you. Okay. Item 4, then, is a motion under Standing Order 17. 42 to resolve to exclude the public from the remainder of the meeting. Are Members content?
Suzy Davies AM: Yes. There's somebody up there.
Lynne Neagle AM: Thank you.","Dr Frank Atherton was first asked about legislations in the draft plan and their ideas on those things. The use of legislation was affirmed by Dr Frank Atherton but it was just one of the tools they have got, they need to employ them all. Then as to sports infrastructure, Dr Frank Atherton, though not an expert in that field, also supported it as a good one to pursue not only in schools but also in a broadening area.",qmsum
"What did Dawn Bowden AM mean when he talked about sports infrastructure?
Lynne Neagle AM: Good morning, everyone. Welcome to the Children, Young People and Education Committee. We've received apologies for absence from Michelle Brown and Jack Sargeant; there are no substitutions. Can I ask if Members have any declarations of interest, please? No. Okay. We'll move on, then, to item 2, which is our scrutiny of the'Healthy Weight: Healthy Wales'draft strategy, and I'm very pleased to welcome Dr Frank Atherton, the Chief Medical Officer for Wales, and Nathan Cook, who is the head of the healthy and active branch at Welsh Government. Thank you, both, for attending this morning. We're very much looking forward to hearing what you've got to say. If you're happy, we'll go straight into questions. If I can just start by asking about the fact that'Healthy Weight: Healthy Wales'is an all-age strategy, really, and how confident you are that it will deliver for children and young people.
Dr Frank Atherton: Well, we're very confident. I mean, it has to, quite clearly. We do need to think about the present generation, the problems faced by the current generation. We have high prevalence of overweight and obesity among adults--we know that, and we can't walk away from that because that's translating into demand on health services. But we have to take a focus, a future generation's focus, almost, on the next generation. I don't write off the current generation, we can't afford to do that, but we do need to think about what can we do that would be different for the next generation so that they don't get into the sorts of problems that we're currently seeing with overweight and obesity. We know that the consequences of that for our young people are going to be enormous if we don't do something and something quite soon. We know that overweight children go on to become overweight adults, unfortunately, and that brings all the consequences of multiple disease issues--diabetes is often cited--cancer risk et cetera. So, we have to focus on children, and, in fact, during the consultation, we've been very clear that we need to engage with children and young people as well. Perhaps we'll get into that at some point, Chair, but, yes, I can give you that assurance.
Lynne Neagle AM: Okay, thank you. What my follow-up question, really, is: can you just tell us what kind of engagement you've had with children and young people to inform the draft strategy?
Dr Frank Atherton: Well, Nathan may be able to influence some of the detail, but in broad terms, we have discussed with young people in a number of fora. In fact, I was delighted that we had a young person, Evie Morgan, a schoolgirl from mid Wales, who came to the joint launch on the consultation. She met the Minister there and gave a very good personal account of her views on obesity and overweight. We've been visiting a number of schools during the consultation process. I'm visiting a school, either this week or next week, at Treorchy, to talk with teachers and young people there. Obviously, we're hopeful that schools and young people will contribute to the consultation as well. So, we've had quite good input, I would say, from children and young people. There is always more we can do we and we want to hear those voices.
Nathan Cook: I was going to say, we've also had a session with youth ambassadors as well, and what we've actually produced for the consultation is not just the children and young people's version, but also a toolkit in terms of getting schools really engaged and involved in terms of the work that we want them to do to feed into this as well. So, we've already had some really good responses from a lot of youth group and schools already.
Lynne Neagle AM: And you've got a structured programme, have you, to roll that out? Okay. Thank you. We've got some questions now on leadership, and the first questions are from Sian Gwenllian.
Sian Gwenllian AM: Good morning. I'll be speaking in Welsh. The Minister for health said yesterday, in answering a question from me on the Chamber floor, that you gave him advice not to have a target in terms of reducing obesity among children. Could you confirm that that's what your advice was and tell us why you don't think that a target is needed?
Dr Frank Atherton: My advice was not that we don't need a target--we may well need a target, and that's one of the issues we need to consult on--but that the target that had been adopted in England and in Scotland to halve the prevalence of obesity in children was more aspirational than deliverable, and that if we are to choose a target in Wales, then we need to balance deliverability with challenge. We need a challenging environment. So, there is something about performance management, because I would be looking to not just the health system but the health and care system and to public services boards to think about how they're delivering on this, and I think we can use targets to that. But they are one tool in the box that I would think we could use, and part of the consultation is to ask that question--'If we are to go down a route in Wales of choosing a target, what might that look like?'Sian Gwenllian AM: Okay. So, to be clear, you're not ruling out that maybe we would need a target.
Dr Frank Atherton: It's certainly something that we could consider in terms of the final strategy.
Sian Gwenllian AM: And is that your opinion too?
Nathan Cook: Yes.
Sian Gwenllian AM: Okay. Well, that is contrary to what I was told yesterday on the floor of the Chamber by the Minister, but there we go. I'm glad to hear that you're not ruling out having a target, because without a target, without something to aim for, how do we know that we're getting there?
Dr Frank Atherton: I think your point about evaluation is really important. Whatever we produce at the end of this process--and we're looking to produce a final strategy towards the autumn--we do need to have a strong evaluation. So, some metrics in there, it would seem, would be appropriate, but what those are, what the nature of those are, do we frame them as targets or ambitions--that's the point we need to consult on.
Sian Gwenllian AM: Okay. And the other point, of course, is the investment. If the Government is going to be successful in terms of the aim of reducing childhood obesity, then it needs to fund and support the actions. Have you made an assessment of the level of investment needed to implement this plan?
Dr Frank Atherton: Resourcing will be important. We currently do make investments in a number of areas that relate to child health generally, and, of course, obesity and overweight in particular. So, the question of resourcing is important. Now, we can't quantify an absolute amount of resource that will be needed to deliver until we know exactly what's going to come out of the consultation and what actions we might want to deliver to a greater degree in Wales. A figure of PS8 million to PS10 million a year has been banded around as a broad kind of area of what we might need to invest, but that would need to be drawn from existing programmes. We need to look at existing programmes, how effective they are. Can we make them more effective? Can we get better value from them? And there may well be a case for new investment, and that's a question, of course, that would need to be discussed with Ministers when we're producing the final strategy.
Nathan Cook: But I think a key consideration as well is we already know there is investment across health boards in some kind of obesity-related services. So, I think what we really need to think about across Wales is how we can drive greater scale, how we can look at current programmes in terms of making sure that they're better evaluated, and how we can make sure that we're also drawing up on the existing resources and capacity out there as well.
Sian Gwenllian AM: And does the level of investment depend on what the target is--what the goal is?
Dr Frank Atherton: I don't think you can necessarily just link the two. The issue of resourcing is one that's there irrespective of whether we choose to put a target in place.
Sian Gwenllian AM: But how would we know that it's being used effectively if there isn't something to aim for?
Dr Frank Atherton: Which brings you back to the question about evaluation. We need proper evaluation of the various programmes that we have.
Sian Gwenllian AM: Yes, but without a target, how can you properly evaluate? If you don't know what you're trying to do, how can you properly evaluate? Anyway, you're open to suggestions about having a target, which is great. Would you agree that Government could use the revenue that's being produced through the levy on soft drinks towards some of these efforts to--?
Dr Frank Atherton: Well, of course, there are some consequentials that are coming to the Welsh Government as part of the levy on sugary soft drinks. That funding, of course, is less than we had anticipated, and that reflects, actually, a success story because industry is reformulating, and so the amount of sugar in soft drinks is already starting to decrease, which is a good thing. But to your question: should we use the funding? Well, of course we should use funding. I'm not personally in favour of hypothecation, I think I'm more interested in the totality of resource that goes into public health programmes than into marginal resource. There are, of course, a number of initiatives that we currently fund through the general revenue. And when I think about obesity, I don't just think about the relatively small marginal amounts of money that come in through whatever source, but I think about the totality of the PS7 billion we spend in health and social care and how we can divert and channel some of that towards broad prevention initiatives in general, and towards tackling being overweight and obesity in particular.
Sian Gwenllian AM: You're saying that it's less than expected. Could you give us any kind of figure?
Dr Frank Atherton: I'm sorry, could you repeat the question?
Sian Gwenllian AM: You say that there is less money that's come in through these consequentials from the levy, can you mention some sort of figure?
Dr Frank Atherton: The figure that I have in mind is about PS56 million that's coming in in terms of revenue over a two-year period. But I'd have to confirm that with the committee. What the anticipated--. When the sugar levy was first brought in, there was some modelling at UK level about what level of revenue that would bring, but it was based on the amount of sugar that was currently then in drinks and the fact that the sugar has reduced in drinks, I mean, the total amount available to the UK is less and hence our consequentials are less. Nathan may have some precise figures.
Nathan Cook: Yes, I was going to say, there was a mid-year report done where the levy has raised PS150 million to date since coming into force in April, and the original forecast was PS520 million a year. So, I think that shows the amount of work that's been done by industry around reformulation.
Sian Gwenllian AM: And the consequentials of that? That is the consequential--PS150 million.
Nathan Cook: On a UK level.
Sian Gwenllian AM: Yes, so what's the Welsh consequential?
Lynne Neagle AM: Fifty-six.
Sian Gwenllian AM: Fifty-six? Gosh, that sounds a lot. Anyway, it's a good sum of money and you're talking about investing PS8 million to PS10 million. So, obviously, you know, we can be more ambitious because there is money in that pot if that money was ring-fenced for this particular scheme.
Dr Frank Atherton: Well, the resource is going to be a real issue that we need to address, and I think as Nathan has said, there is funding of various initiatives currently in the system, and we need to look at that and make that as effective as possible. Will there be a need for some additional resource? There may well be, and that's a question that we'll have to look at in terms of the strategy when we develop it and have a discussion with Ministers about the level of resourcing.
Lynne Neagle AM: Can I just ask on that before Sian moves on? What assessment have you made of how that money is being spent in other UK nations? Because my understanding is that the money is being used in other UK nations to directly impact on obesity. Have you given any consideration to--? As I understand it, that money now is being dispersed around a plethora of programmes, including the transformation programme, and what I found very odd, really, was vaccination, which is surely the core business of the NHS. Have you got any view on that?
Dr Frank Atherton: I'm not sure I understand your point, Chair, in terms of the link between the consequentials from--. Are you talking about the consequentials from the sugar levy or are you talking about--?
Lynne Neagle AM: Yes, because in other nations, it is being used to directly impact on initiatives to tackle obesity, whereas, we've kind of put it here in Wales into the general pot and it's being used to fund a plethora of different things.
Dr Frank Atherton: Well, that cuts to what I was talking about. My preference--it's a personal view--is that hypothecation doesn't really help us too much. I mean, what we need to look at is whether the programmes, the sorts of programmes that are being funded in England, or indeed in Scotland, are working effectively, and if they are, are they being delivered here in Wales? We have looked very carefully at the plans that England and Scotland have for tackling obesity and overweight, and we've made a comparison with what we're doing in Wales, and our ambition in Wales is to go further than those nations, in many ways. But I come back to the point that just linking the hypothecation of a relatively small amount of resource is likely to be less impactful than asking a question of public services boards and of the health system, indeed, about how much money, overall, are we putting into prevention.
Lynne Neagle AM: No, I recognise that, and I think we're talking about additional resource. Suzy.
Suzy Davies AM: I was just wondering whether you thought that there was a useful psychological link on the part of the public between saying,'Here's a sugar levy', and'It's going to be used to help children and adults stay healthier.'Going into a pot, it actually makes it quite difficult to explain the purpose of the tax in the first place. So, I take your overall point, but in terms of the people who we're trying to help in all this, actually creating a direct link might be quite helpful.
Dr Frank Atherton: You may be right. I'm not a behavioural psychologist. We'd have to ask--
Suzy Davies AM: Neither am I. I'm a person who eats a lot of sugar. [Laughter. ]
Dr Frank Atherton: Your point's taken.
Suzy Davies AM: Thank you.
Lynne Neagle AM: Thanks. Sian.
Sian Gwenllian AM: The last question from me, about partnership working. You're putting an emphasis on the whole-system approach in implementing the plan, how are you going to create a system that co-ordinates action and drives change across relevant partners, avoiding a situation where it's everyone's role, but nobody's responsibility? How are you going to avoid that?
Dr Frank Atherton: It's a very important question, and one of the four strands in the consultation is exactly related to that, around leadership and drive nationally. I'm not interested in producing a strategy that sits on a shelf. If you look around the world, there are plenty of obesity strategies. You may notice, by the way, that we've chosen not to talk about an obesity strategy but a healthy weight strategy, because I think having a positive construct is really quite important to us here in Wales. But leadership will be really important, and we will need some sort of structure to lead this, to provide oversight. I'm not a great believer in creating new structures, so we do need something that will give that drive, but the leadership comes from the top down. We need political commitment to this, and that's why I welcome the input from this committee. So, that needs to be assured. And then we need to make sure that the public sector generally is engaged in this, but it goes way beyond the public sector, of course, because we have to work with industry, and we have to work with communities, and we have to work with the public on this. So we need to think about our governance system for this and how we drive it forward. Interestingly, we had quite a large discussion two days ago between health and social care, but also involving the third sector and some members of the public, around how can we drive prevention more generally. It wasn't specifically on obesity, but of course obesity came up because it's such a pressing issue. This question of governance was discussed quite extensively, and we do have governance systems, of course, in Wales. We have public services boards, we have regional partnership boards, and how we can get those aligned behind this common agenda is really important. But I'd like to see--and I know I'm a public health professional, so I know that only maybe 10 per cent, 15 per cent, possibly 20 per cent of what makes and keeps us healthy as individuals and as communities can be driven through the health system; but I would like the system to step up and take these kinds of issues more seriously as well. So I'd be looking for local leadership through directors of public health and indeed through chief executives to work with their public services boards on this. So, we'll need some sort of national oversight, absolutely, but we need local ownership and local leadership, too.
Lynne Neagle AM: Thank you. We've got some questions now from Janet Finch-Saunders.
Janet Finch-Saunders AM: Thank you, Chair. Delivery of the plan will be led by a national implementation board that will be accountable to Ministers. Which Minister do you believe it should be accountable to, or, given the complexity of obesity, should the board be directly accountable to the First Minister?
Dr Frank Atherton: Ultimately, the First Minister will be responsible for this and will want to have a strong oversight of this. It is often framed as a health issue, and the Minister, Vaughan Gething, has a strong personal commitment to this, I know. We've talked extensively with him and with sports and recreation colleagues about that, so there's a link there. It does cut across all portfolios, and so this is an issue that I have discussed with Cabinet, and that collective ownership is really important, and will be, because it can't just sit in one domain. I think what you do need to have is you do need to have a lead organisation or a lead ministry, and I would see health as--I work within health, so I'm perhaps biased, but I would see health as leading this, but it needs broad ownership across Government.
Janet Finch-Saunders AM: I know my colleague Sian Gwenllian mentioned earlier targets and things, but I know in Wales we're not too good at collecting data. What data is currently available on childhood obesity and what metrics will be used to measure progress against the plan's objectives?
Dr Frank Atherton: Well, of course, our main data source is the child measurement programme, which collects information on children entering school aged four or five. That's our main source of information. If we look at that data, it shows us--. Well, I'm sure you're familiar with the statistics, but it'll be just under a third of children at that age who are overweight or obese--
Janet Finch-Saunders AM: Could I just ask--sorry to interrupt--how up to date is that?
Dr Frank Atherton: The last survey was just last year.
Nathan Cook: The data was published last week.
Dr Frank Atherton: Yes, the lastest data was out last week.
Janet Finch-Saunders AM: It is pretty up to date.
Dr Frank Atherton: So, it's pretty up to date, and what it shows--. It's not getting radically worse--there's always statistical variation in these things--but it's not getting any better. And, for the first time last year, we did look at the question not just of children who were overweight or obese, but we actually singled out the proportion who are obese, severely obese. So we have a figure for that for the first time, which is about 12 per cent, which is quite shocking, in a way.
Janet Finch-Saunders AM: It is shocking.
Dr Frank Atherton: So, that's our main source of information. Does that answer your question?
Janet Finch-Saunders AM: Yes, but how will any gaps in your data be addressed?
Dr Frank Atherton: Well, one of the questions that are often asked is: could we measure more on a longitudinal basis? By that I mean in England, for example, children are measured at school entry and then again at year 11--at age 11 or 12. , that kind of age group. And so you do have a longitudinal view over time of what's happening to children. I think that would be helpful to us in Wales, and it's one of the questions in the consultation about whether we should expand that. Obviously, that would have significant resource implications, not just for the funding, but also for schools and for the system to deliver it. But it's something that maybe would help us in terms of better understanding and better evaluation--the point that was made earlier.
Nathan Cook: And the other data we do have is the millennium cohort study, which has been released, for 14 and 15-year-olds. That's going to be--. We're starting to think about how we can utilise some of that data, looking at that longitudinal picture around children as well, which will be really helpful.
Janet Finch-Saunders AM: Thank you. You've answered my next question. Thank you.
Lynne Neagle AM: Can I just ask about the child measurement programme? The strategy commits to looking at whether we can have a second measurement taking place in Wales. Can you just tell us a bit more about your thinking on that and when you would see a second measurement taking place and how you would use that data?
Dr Frank Atherton: I touched on that just now, but personally I do think it would be helpful to have more information. It's always the case, There's always a trade-off between the cost of getting that information and the value of the information. So, the question of how it would be used would be really important. There is still a lot that we don't know. We know an awful lot about obesity and being overweight and the causes of it, but we don't really have a very clear understanding, in Wales at least, of the point at which children start to become overweight. Although we know that overweight children tend to go on to become overweight adults, we don't know what proportion of them between school entry and later teenage years--what those changes are. So, it would help us to have some better understanding, which would help to direct some of our initiatives. I'd be generally supportive of the principle. We'll wait and see what comes out in the consultation, and it's something that we need to give thought to, but we do have to trade off the additionality of what the information would give us with the cost of doing that, of course.
Lynne Neagle AM: Okay. Thank you. We've got some questions now on healthy environments from Dawn Bowden.
Dawn Bowden AM: Thank you, Chair. In the draft plan, some of the measures in there suggest legislating for restricting price promotions and banning energy drinks, and that sort of thing. Do you think that, if we go down that road, there's going to be time within this Assembly to introduce such legislation? And, if not, what do you think might be the timescale for such legislation?
Dr Frank Atherton: It may well be that there are things in Wales that we might wish to legislate on, and you've mentioned two of them, and they're good examples. We would, obviously, need to undertake quite detailed consultation on those and, in a way, we need to mirror what's happening in England and in Scotland to some degree around the consultations they're having on energy drinks. We also need to influence the issues that are not devolved to us and we seek to do that. As to your question of legislative time, I'm not really in a position to answer that. What I could say is that legislation may well be one of the outcomes of the consultation. There may well be things that we wish to choose to legislate on. The timing of that will have to be subject to other pressures, and I come back to the point that legislation, of course, is one of the tools that we've got--we need to deploy them all.
Dawn Bowden AM: Sure, I understand that, that you could do other things. I know--. We've heard from the Government, on other calls for legislation, that the programme's very tight, certainly for this term, so I was just wondering whether we might get that in, but okay. If I turn now to the planning system--and this might not be something that you have great deal of knowledge of; I'd just welcome your view on this, because, when we discussed with stakeholders, we talked about whether the planning system, for instance, could be used to, as an example, restrict hot food takeaways around schools and so on. Would that be a measure that you would support, something like that?
Dr Frank Atherton: I think it's definitely something we want to look at and, of course, that question is asked in the consultation, so we would like to know people's views on that. It's an interesting one. I think there is a question--a really important question--about how we can use the planning system more effectively. I've discussed with Nathan on a number of occasions, with planning colleagues in Welsh Government and in local authorities, about the art of the possible, let's say. There may be things that we could think about and we want to get those ideas through the consultation. The specific question around takeaways, particularly takeaways near schools, is often asked. I was very interested to see, up in the north-east, some time ago, that one of the local authorities up there did put a moratorium on the opening of new fast-food venues near to schools, or indeed in areas where levels of obesity and overweight were particularly high. I understand London is now--some London boroughs are now--experimenting with that as well. So, that gave me comfort, because maybe there are powers within local authorities that can be used more effectively. I think my view at the moment is that the jury's kind of out on whether those are effective and how effective they're going to be. But the fact that we have some initiatives around the UK does give us an opportunity to study that and to learn from experience perhaps and then, if it is shown to be beneficial, to think about that here in Wales, yes.
Dawn Bowden AM: Sure, because it will only be one of a suite of measures anyway. Of itself, it wouldn't address the problem, but, added to other initiatives, I guess it would. Can I just ask you briefly, then, about community sport infrastructure and, in particular, of new schools? So, Welsh Government, as you know, has ploughed a huge amount of money into the twenty-first century schools programme. What we heard when we spoke to stakeholders recently, particularly headteachers, was that, in some of the new schools that have been built, we haven't had changing rooms and toilet facilities, for instance, built into the new buildings. So, if we're going to try and utilise these buildings for general community activity to get kids and the wider public, actually, more active, do you think that's something that we ought to be building in? Again, not your particular direct area of responsibility, but something that you might have an input into, is that, when we're developing schools, we should be making sure that they have those kinds of facilities so that they become accessible to the wider public. Is that something that you would be prepared to make a recommendation around?
Dr Frank Atherton: Well, it's certainly a fascinating area and one that I think has a lot of potential. It goes--. You're right to raise it in the context of schools, and I can understand why this committee would, but I think it goes beyond that, actually, into all developments in the public sector and how they're developed and whether we're building health into our environment, which perhaps is your starting point. One of the things that I was really pleased to see in terms of the Public Health (Wales) Act 2017 that was passed a couple of years ago was the use of health impact assessment as a tool, and we're still working on how that will inform policy and how that will be applied in issues such as policy decisions through Government, but also in more downstream issues about how we create the public infrastructure that the public can and should be using. And so I would like to see the use of health impact assessments to a much greater degree to inform those kinds of decisions. If you apply that kind of lens and you take the point, which is inherent in your question, I think, that schools are not just for kids, they're for communities, then you would--it would lead you to a conclusion that you would perhaps design and build them in a different way. So, on a personal basis, I would certainly support your view that we should be looking to use the sports environment in schools in the same way as we use leisure centres. There are all kinds of barriers in there, and I understand all of that, and it's not really my field, exactly as you say, but, as a matter of principle, I think it's a good one to pursue.
Dawn Bowden AM: Okay. Thank you. And widening it out to other public services buildings as well.
Dr Frank Atherton: Indeed.
Dawn Bowden AM: Yes. Okay. Thank you.
Lynne Neagle AM: Okay, thank you. We're going to move on now to talk about how we create healthy settings. I've got some questions from Suzy Davies.
Suzy Davies AM: Thank you very much. Yes, perhaps if we could just stay in this area of education just for a moment, I think we all agree that healthy habits acquired early on probably tend to last quite well, so I wonder if you can tell us a little bit about the healthy and sustainable preschool scheme and whether you think some timescales should be made public about what you expect the achievements from that scheme to be. But, in particular, I was struck with what you said about local leadership, and I just want you to bear that in mind in answering the next question, which is about the foundation phase. You're probably aware that this committee has heard from various school leaders that they're struggling in some cases to meet the ratio of staffing for the foundation phase, which potentially compromises the purpose of it in terms of physical activity. I'm just wondering how the strategy development board is considering that at the moment. Is it something that's come on the radar for the board? Is it something you're thinking about? And, if so, who do you think should be responsible for pinning that down a little bit? Because this is education, not health, and--.
Dr Frank Atherton: Well, look, I've got to confess to you, I'm not an educationist, and so the question on staffing numbers in schools is not one that I have been asked to give a deal of consideration to, and it hasn't really been discussed, I don't believe, in the context of development of the strategy. If there is a specific point around that that the committee would like to make in terms of a response into the consultation, which I presume you'll be making, then we'd be happy to consider that. As to healthy preschools, I don't know, Nathan may have some view on that. I've not been closely involved with the work. We have standards and we perhaps need to think about how we tighten those standards and how we--enforce isn't the right word, but how we implement and make sure that those standards are properly implemented, because you're absolutely right to say that habits are developed early in life. That's in the preschool; it's also in the home of course, and then later in the school. So, we do need to look at all of those as settings and are there more things we can do within those settings to drive healthier behaviours--that's exactly why we need the consultation.
Nathan Cook: But I would say, through that scheme as well, we've really got a really good bank of preschools that are actually doing some really great work in this area as well. So, I think the more we can understand the successes that some of those environments are having--you know, how we can roll those out and work across other settings to create that wider impact as well is going to be really important.
Suzy Davies AM: Okay. Thank you. What I'm thinking about is expectations at that level will be expectations at a slightly older level, which will be contained within the foundation phase. And while you're quite right--obviously, parents have a role in this, or families--there will be, particularly with the introduction of the new curriculum, certain expectations on schools to provide not just healthy environments but to actively work towards well-being and healthy weight in children and things. And that's why I asked you about local leadership, because, if it fails for reasons that have nothing to do with the plan at foundation phase, it's going to fail further up the school years as well. I think it might be something that the board might want to consider here, because at some point there'll be an accountability question and we will want to know how'Healthy Weight: Healthy Wales'fits in with the new plans for the new curriculum, and whether it's merely persuasive and influential or whether it has the weight to place some obligations on school leaders about what they do in their schools. So, this connection, I think, is quite an important one, and, if the strategy development board could consider that, I think it would be very helpful, because this doesn't exist in a vacuum.
Dr Frank Atherton: Well, I'd certainly be delighted to take that back and we can look at it in terms of how we move from the consultation into the final strategy. It's certainly a point we can try and look at.
Suzy Davies AM: Because we will want to know who to ask:'you're the accountable person--why has something worked, or not worked?'We will need to know that at some point.
Dr Frank Atherton: Just building on Nathan's point, some of the schools--I know it's schools rather than the preschools, and I take your point, but some of the schools we've been working with have absolutely brilliant models of good practice and good local leadership. I remember the Minister actually at the launch, and one of the schools was represented there, and they presented--the school came and some of the children came and presented--to the whole audience about the activities that they were undertaking in their school around physical activity and on healthy eating, and it was such a model of good behaviour the question was,'Well, why not everywhere?', so that probably speaks to your question.
Suzy Davies AM: Okay, well, thank you for that commitment anyway.
Lynne Neagle AM: And have you had any discussions, then, with education officials around things like teacher training and CPD, because you'll be aware the Health and Social Care Committee has made a number of recommendations in this area? It's crucial that we skill up the staff to develop these things in an appropriate way, isn't it?
Dr Frank Atherton: Well, we certainly discuss with education colleagues in Welsh Government. There's more we need to do in terms of that, because you're absolutely right: there's something about building the whole of the workforce--education is really important, but elsewhere as well; it's about how do we really make every contact count, you know, that construct. So, everybody who's working in the health and social care system should have a role in this; everybody who works in education, whether it's the old--. Do we still have dinner ladies? Or teachers, you know, they have a role to play in supporting children to be as healthy as they possibly can. And, actually, I see them, Chair, as a really essential part of the public health workforce.
Lynne Neagle AM: Okay, thank you. Suzy, are you going to do your curriculum one?
Suzy Davies AM: Well, I've bound it in together, but that final point you make about teachers being part of the answer to this, they're already under a range of pressures: is it fair to make them accountable for whether this works or not? Or should that local leadership lie somewhere else? I don't expect you to pin down a person today.
Dr Frank Atherton: I wouldn't like to blame a teacher or performance manage them on the proportion of their children in their class who are overweight. That would clearly be nonsense, wouldn't it? But they are part of the solution, and so the accountability lies further up the chain, doesn't it? The question I think we would have, and public services boards might well ask, and the local education authorities may well ask, is: how effective is any particular school at driving forwards these healthy behaviours?
Suzy Davies AM: Okay, thank you. I'll leave some questions for Hefin.
Lynne Neagle AM: Hefin.
Hefin David AM: Is that all right, Chair?
Lynne Neagle AM: You've got the floor, Hefin.
Hefin David AM: Thank you, Chair. You make a commitment to embedding physical activity at an early stage in primary school education. What would that look like?
Dr Frank Atherton: Just in terms of the physical activity, I have to say it's a really important dimension and we need to move further on. We know not enough of our children are physically active and they're not meeting the various guidelines, so it's really important. It doesn't actually have as much of an impact on weight as the dietary issue. I'd just say that. It's really important for all sorts of reasons. It does have an impact on healthy weight, but it has a huge impact in terms of socialisation, in terms of mental health issues, et cetera, you know. So--I'm sorry, I've lost track of your question.
Nathan Cook: I'd just say that one thing we have got in train is, obviously, Sport Wales, Public Health Wales and Natural Resources Wales--we have them working together as a collaborative at the moment to look at how their joint delivery on physical activity can be taken forward more efficiently. So, one of the things they are looking at is obviously the schools programmes they do through eco-schools, the Welsh network of healthy schools and the sports programme to really think about that physical activity and how we can have better join up in terms of the programmes that we're already delivering as well.
Hefin David AM: With that in mind, I'm going to confess to you, chief medical officer, I did anything in school I could to avoid physical education lessons. I hated it. I didn't feel engaged with it. Yet, two weeks ago, I played for the Assembly rugby team--I wanted to get that in. The school sports survey, that would suggest that we're still not hitting those targets with children. How can we get children more engaged with physical education in ways that--? I felt completely alienated in school.
Dr Frank Atherton: Well, you're right, and many people go through that same journey and come to physical activity later in life, and that's great if they do that. The sad reality is that many people don't, and we also know that there are issues around the dropping off, particularly for girls, of physical activity towards the teenage years. So, there are specific moments that we need to understand. We do have a lot of information about these kinds of things. Public Health Wales is very good at collating the information. We do need to turn that into programmes. I mean, at the heart of it, it's about making sports and physical activity enjoyable and attractive to people. Sometimes that's easier, I sense, for boys than for girls, but we need to tailor things to different audiences.
Hefin David AM: Yes, that's the trick, isn't it? It's about finding out what children enjoy doing. That could be quite a wide and varied range of things. Is that the key?
Dawn Bowden AM: It's not all about organised team sports.
Hefin David AM: Yes. As Dawn said, it's not just about organised team sports. There are some very individual activities you could do.
Dr Frank Atherton: Absolutely, yes. And that's where I think--. I'm delighted that Sport Wales has moved beyond. It's not just about elite sports; it's about getting everybody engaged and active in sports, and that partnership with Public Health Wales that Nathan talked about is really important, because we need a population approach to driving physical activity.
Hefin David AM: So, do you think, with that in mind, we need statutory guidance for schools on physical education?
Dr Frank Atherton: Again, I'd look to the consultation as to whether there was an appetite for any kind of guidance. It may well be that that is something that could be considered.
Hefin David AM: Okay. And finally, with regard to free school meals to all pupils in primary and secondary schools, do you think that extending that to all pupils would be beneficial in providing a more varied diet for pupils?
Dr Frank Atherton: I don't have a personal view on that. I think it's the quality of the food that kids are getting, whether that comes from home or through school, and whether it's free or whether it's paid for. I think it's the quality of the food that we need to focus on. The question of children being hungry at school is a really important one and needs to be addressed at a national level. I think that's a--
Hefin David AM: So, you think that's more about the provision of food for those who might not have access to it than providing a varied diet.
Dr Frank Atherton: I think it's important that children have access to food, absolutely, if that's your question, but we also need to look at the quality of the food and what's in that food offer.
Hefin David AM: But you don't necessarily think universal provision would--.
Dr Frank Atherton: I don't have a clear view on that. I know there's a larger debate about that.
Hefin David AM: Okay, thank you.
Lynne Neagle AM: I've got some supplementaries from Janet and then Suzy.
Janet Finch-Saunders AM: Yes. I've been around some amazing schools in my own constituency, where they've got proper canteen facilities for pupils and really, really good produce in the meals. However, there's probably only a third having school meals; the rest are packed lunches. And, to be honest, I've been very surprised and shocked at what I've seen of the quality of the food in the packed lunches. Nobody can really police, and I wouldn't want to see parents being policed over what goes in a packed lunch, so if there is data out there to suggest that there's a larger percentage of parents providing packed lunched that are really not good at all, then there is some merit to be said for what Hefin is--. Me, personally, I'd love to see the introduction of universal school meals. I think it's been a very retrograde step, going backwards. Would you be willing to carry out any research?
Dr Frank Atherton: So, I mean, your point about food that's brought in in the packed lunches is a really important one, and I've talked to some headteachers as well about this. We could go down a route of guidance and prohibition, but that gets you into the role of nanny in chief and I don't really see that as my role or Government's role, and I don't think it's effective either. Do you remember--? You must have seen on tv--I think it was in Scotland; I don't know if it's happened in Wales--parents pushing the fish and chip packets through the school railings. We don't need to get into that. What I have seen, though, is some really good innovative practice in schools where, for example, they reward children for bringing the healthy options. Schools can give guidance to parents about what would be a healthy lunch and what sort of things might be expected to be seen in the lunch box. And you can reward children, and children do respond to rewards. So, I've seen some of those approaches that have transformed, actually, the offer of what comes in school boxes. But I think just banning chocolate bars and crisps in the packed lunch is unlikely to be successful.
Janet Finch-Saunders AM: We can't do that. So, my point to the question was: isn't there some merit, perhaps, about all children being equal and eating similar good-quality food in schools?
Dr Frank Atherton: Yes. That gets you back to the question about universal school meals.
Janet Finch-Saunders AM: Perhaps some of that PS56 million sugar tax, even. Who knows?
Lynne Neagle AM: Suzy.
Suzy Davies AM: Yes. Mine is just a short question. The draft plan commits, doesn't it, to updating the healthy eating in schools regulations--the 2013 regulations? I appreciate this is a consultation, but what is it that needs changing in those regulations at the moment, just to give us a bit of steer?
Nathan Cook: It's mainly on sugar content, so, obviously, they don't adhere to current Scientific Advisory Committee on Nutrition guidelines around sugar levels. So, what we'd want to consider is, you know, what we need to be careful of is unintended consequences of changing that, as well, if you see a shift to more kids bringing in school packed lunches as well. So, I think we want to consider the best way of doing that and consider through the consultation how we can go about it.
Suzy Davies AM: All right. So, it's very pertinent to Janet's question, in that way. Okay, so it's mainly about sugar, but it could be about other things as well. Okay. Thanks.
Lynne Neagle AM: Okay. The next questions are from Janet anyway; firstly, on the clinical obesity pathway.
Janet Finch-Saunders AM: The'Healthy Weight: Healthy Wales'plan commits to a review of the clinical obesity pathway. What are the time frames for this review, and what do you think are the basic essentials of a clinical obesity pathway for children and young people?
Dr Frank Atherton: We do have a pathway for managing overweight, and that's been in place since about 2010, I believe, and we do need to bring that up to date in terms of current knowledge and experiences. We've challenged Public Health Wales; we've asked Public Health Wales to undertake a review of that pathway, and they are going through that process now. I'm not sure of exactly the time frame that we have given them for that.
Nathan Cook: We were asking them to review the pathway before we launch the final strategy in October because, obviously, what we want is for that to inform what that final strategy looks like. So, we'll be looking probably early autumn for them to report back on that.
Dr Frank Atherton: The second point of your question about what are the essential elements, I mean, they are already there; we need to tweak them and we need to make sure that they're properly delivered. But it's a tiered approach, so, having access to information through schools and through communities and into families is part of the first step of that. And then, if children are overweight, it's a question about how they're identified. There are questions about the ability of the public to recognise large children, so there may be an issue there. But when children are running into issues around weight, what kind of interventions can be put in, either through primary care or through communities through health visitors, et cetera? And then of course we do have--and we've started to shine a light on this, haven't we--the very overweight children. I don't think we have enough in the way of targeted support to be able to support those. There are programmes available, but they're perhaps not universally provided. So, I think there's something about looking at our whole pathway, mapping out what the current evidence now shows us is needed, and then thinking about what is our provision in Wales and what do we need to do to bring that up to the level of the places that are the best.
Janet Finch-Saunders AM: Thank you. The draft plan recognises the importance of the first 1,000 days, but it doesn't appear to include any new proposals to help parents to enable lifestyle changes. It lists existing initiatives, such as the Healthy Child Wales programme and breastfeeding action plan. Are you satisfied that the draft plan does enough to address the influence that family and parents have on children's healthy weight behaviours, particularly in the first 1,000 days?
Dr Frank Atherton: Well, the first 1,000 days are really critically in shaping lives, as I'm sure you'd agree. We are absolutely open to any other suggestions that the public or this committee have as to what more we can and should do. There are a number of things, the sorts of programmes you've mentioned, that I think could be more effective. We're currently looking at breastfeeding because it starts before birth, actually. We know that children who are breastfed are less likely to suffer from obesity in childhood and, indeed, to go on to be obese adults. So, we do need to go further on that. We do have some programmes--Healthy Working Wales, et cetera--that need to be improved. If there are other interventions in other areas that we need to take, then we'd be delighted to hear what they are, but those are the ones that have jumped out so far.
Nathan Cook: Can I just say--? One of the proposals we're looking for is, obviously, we know that during pregnancy it's a really critical time when we can actually look to work with mothers. We know from looking at some of the behaviour change that it's actually a really critical point when new mothers really start thinking about their lives, wanting the best for their child and their families. So, what we are thinking about is how we could develop some kind of approaches to that going forward. But we know our Healthy Start scheme is also a good lever for us, just in terms of how we can look to improve that kind of dietary offer at the earliest stage as well.
Janet Finch-Saunders AM: Thank you. Finally, we know that for some families day-to-day challenges can make it difficult for them to make healthy choices, particularly for those on lower incomes and/or maybe using food banks. Could the Welsh Government take bolder action to better support low-income families to eat healthily?
Dr Frank Atherton: Well, you've touched on a really important point about inequalities because overweight and obesity is not evenly distributed across our population. It absolutely is more prevalent in more socioeconomically deprived communities, and that's something that should really concern us all. So, it gets you to questions of availability of fresh food and produce; it gets you to questions of formulation of products and whether value brands are less healthy than more premium brands. So, it cuts across all of those issues that we talked about in terms of settings and in terms of environment earlier. There is something about the affordability of good-quality healthy food that we need to think about. We do need to think in broad terms--broader terms than just obesity, but we do need to think in broad terms--about how we create a society where families have the wherewithal to lead healthy lives, and that gets you to really important questions about the minimum wage and income poverty. There's no doubt in my mind--I'm a public health professional--and there's no doubt in my mind that economic success and health success go hand in hand. So, you speak to a very deep question there. In terms of what we can do through this particular consultation, there are some things in there about providing better access, but without tackling some of those deeper determinants of health, their impact will necessarily be limited.
Janet Finch-Saunders AM: Thank you.
Lynne Neagle AM: Just finally from me, then, you referred earlier to the importance of making every contact count, but some stakeholders have told the committee that they struggle to do that because of difficulties in availability of people to refer to. Is that a situation that you recognise and what, really, can we do to improve that situation?
Dr Frank Atherton: Well, it depends what you mean as to where to refer to. So, the health system obviously needs to respond to this issue. What we're seeing across the NHS is a gradual transformation in primary care so that primary care is no longer about going to see your GP, it's about going to see a practice where you have a range of health professionals. Would I like to see more dietetic support, for example, in that setting? Absolutely I would. I think we need to think in terms of that pathway that we were talking about earlier, about access to that kind of advice and support, which can head off people getting into problems and kids getting into problems with weight issues. So, that question of redesign of the pathway really speaks to, I think, your point about,'Well, where do people go when they have problems with their weight?'That's true for adults and it's true for children as well.
Lynne Neagle AM: Okay, thank you. Are there any other questions from Members? No. Okay. Well, can I thank you both very much for your attendance? It's been a really productive session. We appreciate your time. You will be sent a transcript to check for accuracy in due course, but thank you again.
Dr Frank Atherton: We'll do that. Thank you, Chair, and thank you to the committee, because getting some input into the consultation from children's perspectives, this would be one of the routes we would absolutely welcome. Thank you.
Lynne Neagle AM: Okay, thank you very much. Item 3, then, is papers to note. Paper to note 1 is a letter from the Welsh Health Specialised Services Committee on CAMHS tier 4 provision. Paper to note 2 is a letter from the Minister for Health and Social Services also on CAMHS in-patient provision. Paper to note 3 is a letter from the Children Commissioner for Wales on tier 4 CAMHS provision.

Suzy Davies AM: Yes. There's somebody up there.
Lynne Neagle AM: Thank you.","Dawn Bowden AM asked for Dr Frank Atherton's ideas on community sport infrastructure of new schools, and pointed out that Welsh Government has ploughed a huge amount of money into the twenty-first century schools programme. At the end of speech, Dawn Bowden AM thought they should be making sure that they have those kinds of facilities so that they become accessible to the wider public. At the same time, Dawn Bowden AM gave advice on making a recommendation of sports infrastructure to Dr Frank Atherton.",qmsum
"Summarize the recap of the last meeting regarding the presentation by Industrial Designer.
Project Manager: Well hi everyone again.
User Interface: Hello.
Industrial Designer: Hello.
Marketing: Hello
Project Manager: Um {vocalsound} like before we uh {disfmarker} I have to redo the meetings from {vocalsound} {disfmarker} n th the minutes from the last meeting
Marketing: Mm-hmm.
Project Manager: and so here we go. Uh it was discussed in the last meeting uh which was opened by the presentation from the interface um designer {vocalsound} that uh looks would be very important on this new remote
User Interface: Designer. {vocalsound}
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: and um it is to send messages of course to the T_V_. It should have nine channel buttons, a next button, volume buttons, subtitle buttons, switch to control features, colour contrast, sharpness etcetera. It should have a memory switch, a mute button in case the telephone rings or something. Uh speech recognition is one of her very f favourite personal uh features she would like see d d to be integrated in this um in this new remote. Um. {vocalsound} Should be child friendly design with few buttons, colourful maybe with s star shaped or other shaped buttons. Um she uh presented also an oversized remote which she guarantees nobody will ever be able to lose.
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Um {disfmarker}
Marketing: And she was challenged on that point {vocalsound}
Project Manager: {vocalsound} that's right. {vocalsound}
User Interface: {vocalsound} Yes. {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: But uh her very f personal favourite really she, she would very much like to see a speech recogniser integrated in this remote. The industrial designer um presented her uh {vocalsound} thoughts on the issue. She would like a special case made out of plastic that is very strong, not using any harmful materials, should be recyclable and should be colourful. Should have an integrated circuit board that's highly sophisticated and temperature resistant. She would like to see a timer and or alarm facility integrated. Uh technically this thing would also have a resistor and a capacitor, diode transistor, resonator, and if possible a rechargeable battery. Uh and of course a circuit board. And how it would works, you press the button, the chip is morse {disfmarker} morse code related relays the {disfmarker} uh to the generat to the generator amplification and uh the circuit board is very inexpensive to build and so she thinks this is a great feature uh to to to consider.
Marketing: Okay.
Project Manager: She would like uh {disfmarker} this whole thing should be push buttons with a simple chip uh scrolling method is more expensive and not that practical anymore. Should be battery operated and of course she would have the special cases. The marketing expert uh who has to finally come up with {disfmarker} to to to market this product has been watching the competition, has done some research on the internet and also has used h her personal observations to come up with the fact that such a remote sh should be small, easy to use and it should be eye catching. From her point of view of course one of the most important facts is that we should get to market before our competition does. To do that uh maybe one or two features should be developed on which we could dwell on or in other words on which our campaign could be built on. Too many new features or too many points would only confuse matter. So we prefer to have one or two features that can be really uh driven home. Um it should have a fruit and vegetable design and should have a soft feel. She feels that's really what people want today. And the decision that we took last time was that uh the special feature we would like to see is a speech recogniser, the energy should be battery uh should be on a chip, should be trendy design, compact and strong, and should have buttons. And that concludes the presentation from the last minutes {disfmarker} from the last meeting. Now uh we are ready for the presentation of the prototype.
User Interface: Yeah.
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
User Interface: Just the look like, the button part I'll explain.
Industrial Designer: Yeah. Uh so this is our {disfmarker} what uh we have made. This is a model of the remote control which we are going to build.
Project Manager: Mm-hmm.
Industrial Designer: Uh this is us in a snail shape so uh it it is attractive
Marketing: Mm-hmm.
Industrial Designer: um and it's {disfmarker} it's blue in colour uh bright and uh it has yellow buttons and all the different colour buttons
Marketing: Mm-hmm.
Industrial Designer: so it is a {disfmarker} uh uh a {disfmarker} looks-wise it is beautiful.
Marketing: Mm-hmm.
Industrial Designer: Uh and also compact in shape.
Marketing: Mm-hmm.
Industrial Designer: Uh um and also i it it will be easily fit into {disfmarker} into the hands and you can access all the buttons easily.
Marketing: Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Good.
Industrial Designer: Yeah,
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: oops, sorry. {vocalsound}
Marketing: {vocalsound} You used to have all the buttons {vocalsound}
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} Um yeah and um uh the material which we are going to use for the case is uh plastic and uh w which which is s strong um uh and also uh for the {disfmarker} Um the material is plastic and uh for the buttons it is uh s soft rubber um and als
Marketing: Oh that's good,
Industrial Designer: yeah.
Marketing: no, that's nice and friendly.
Industrial Designer: Yeah because uh uh you'll be touching the buttons more so it is soft when you touch it.
Marketing: Mm-hmm. Mm.
Project Manager: Mm-hmm,
Marketing: Mm-hmm.
Project Manager: mm-hmm.
Industrial Designer: And then um uh for the {disfmarker} for the led, for the light emitting diode it is a fluorescent green
Marketing: Mm-hmm.
Industrial Designer: and it's a {disfmarker} a {disfmarker} it is a bulb like an ordinary infrared.
Marketing: Mm-hmm.
Industrial Designer: And {disfmarker} and the button {disfmarker} button's part uh will be explained by F Francina.
User Interface: Okay.
Marketing: Okay.
User Interface: Now the um {disfmarker} we decided upon including certain features on our remote. Now these features includes the s um signal emitting uh signal {disfmarker} it's the led or L_E_D_ the infrared.
Project Manager: Mm-hmm,
Marketing: Yeah, okay, mm-hmm.
Project Manager: mm-hmm.
User Interface: Now uh we have included the switch on and off button.
Marketing: Mm-hmm.
User Interface: Now we have included another feature that is the mute button
Marketing: Mm-hmm.
User Interface: on the side of the model. Then we have included one to nine buttons
Marketing: Mm-hmm.
User Interface: for controlling the programmes {disfmarker} the different channels.
Marketing: Mm-hmm.
User Interface: We have also included two buttons for increasing or decreasing the volume.
Marketing: Mm-hmm.
User Interface: And we have also included two buttons for scrolling up and scrolling down the programme channels. Now our {disfmarker} our model also contains a button which is called as the menu button.
Marketing: Mm.
Project Manager: What kind of button?
User Interface: Menu button.
Project Manager: Menu? Uh menu th menu, uh one one.
User Interface: Yes, menu {disfmarker}
Marketing: Menu button. {vocalsound}
User Interface: At the centre
Marketing: Mm-hmm.
User Interface: we have included a button which is fluorescent green colour and this is the menu button which will control the colour, sharpness, brightness
Marketing: Mm-hmm. Of the screen. Mm, mm-hmm.
User Interface: of this uh picture. We have also included a button which is called as the swapping button. Now this is uh a special, special feature which we have included. Now this button is an elongated shaped button and this is slightly flexible so if it is turned towards the right it will take to the previous channel, if it is turned towards the right it will take to the next channel. It will take the user to the previous and the next channel so this is a swapping button.
Marketing: The next channel in the numeric pattern, or {disfmarker}
User Interface: No, swapping is if if example you're {disfmarker} you're watching the second channel and then you go to the tenth channel and if you want to go back to the second channel you can swap, this button.
Marketing: Yeah, mm-hmm. Mm.
User Interface: Yes.
Marketing: Okay, okay.
User Interface: And at the end, it {disfmarker} this remote has inbuilt voice recogniser which c which will recognise the user's voice and then it'll act accordingly.
Project Manager: Okay. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.
User Interface: So this is our proposed model.
Marketing: Okay.
User Interface: Now the marketing expert has to
Marketing: Mm-hmm.
Industrial Designer: Tell, yeah.
User Interface: give her suggestion whether it'll be sellable {vocalsound} or it'll be cost effective.
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Marketing: {vocalsound} Okay, well um what {disfmarker} what I really like a lot about it is that you can reach the whole thing with one thumb,
User Interface: Yes, yes.
Marketing: that you can really hold it in one h you don't need two hands
Industrial Designer: Mm-hmm.
Marketing: and it's easily reachable even for somebody with a small hand, yeah?
Project Manager: Yes the buttons are all raised, right?
Marketing: The buttons are all raised
Project Manager: Are raised, mm-hmm.
User Interface: Yes.
Marketing: and if you hold it in the centre of your hand you can even reach it over here so you don't have to turn it around, turn it upside down, move it up, up and down,
Project Manager: Right. Or have two hands to operate it, yeah.
Marketing: I really like that.
User Interface: Mm.
Industrial Designer: Mm-hmm.
Marketing: You really did a good job on that, my little designers.
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Marketing: {vocalsound} Um and um I like the idea that the on-off button is in a really prominent place. That's that's a really good good thing.
Project Manager: Yes, and it sort of sticks up so that you really {disfmarker}
Marketing: Yeah, that's great.
Project Manager: you don't have to g first go like oh yeah here it's on and yeah, mm-hmm.
Industrial Designer: Hmm. Mm-hmm.
Marketing: Mm-hmm.
User Interface: Abs okay.
Marketing: The colour's very attractive. Um the um these buttons uh around here are the mute
User Interface: No, these {disfmarker} the front buttons which are here, are the mute buttons.
Marketing: and {disfmarker} these {disfmarker} mm-hmm On both sides they're mute?
User Interface: Yes, yes.
Marketing: So you can push either one?
User Interface: Yes.
Marketing: Okay.
Project Manager: So if you're left-handed or right-handed it doesn't matter.
Marketing: And this brings the menu up on the screen?
User Interface: {vocalsound} Pardon me? This is the menu {disfmarker} yes, yes.
Marketing: This brings the menu up on the screen and the orange ones are {disfmarker}
User Interface: A the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} these {disfmarker} these two are th to increase or decrease the volumes,
Marketing: Okay.
User Interface: and these two are to uh scroll the programme channels.
Marketing: F f okay.
User Interface: Scroll up or scroll down the channels.
Marketing: Right, very good. Uh it looks mm looks like something I can sell.
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Marketing: Okay and now I'm supposed to {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Well, I have one question
Marketing: yeah.
Project Manager: uh will there be anything written on the buttons, like that people know, or they have to learn that from a piece of paper which button does what?
User Interface: Yes, it will have uh {disfmarker} these buttons will have the numbers and all the rest of the buttons will have symbols.
Industrial Designer: Ah. Yeah, definitely.
Project Manager: Will have symbols so that that {disfmarker} that the user really knows you know and doesn't have to first learn it {disfmarker}
User Interface: Yes, which can be easily recognised.
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
Marketing: Yeah.
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
User Interface: Yes.
Industrial Designer: Yeah. Yeah.
Marketing: Good point because we need the symbols'cause we're going into an international market we can't have anything that's language dependent.
User Interface: Yes.
Industrial Designer: Yeah of course, and also {disfmarker}
User Interface: Yes.
Industrial Designer: Hmm.
Project Manager: Yeah. But anyway it would ha i i i it has to have some kind of of symbols, text or something so that people kn
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
User Interface: Yes.
Industrial Designer: Yeah we can {disfmarker} Text.
Marketing: Symbols on it. Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.
User Interface: Yes.
Industrial Designer: Text that we can have on the case itself,
Project Manager: That's right.
User Interface: Yes.
Industrial Designer: we can {disfmarker} it will be printed on the case and symbols as well as the buttons. Yeah.
Marketing: Mm-hmm.
Project Manager: Okay, yeah just wanted make sure of that mm-hmm.
User Interface: And {disfmarker} and one more feature is we we have a holder for this remote which is an oyster shape.
Marketing: Mm,'kay, mm. Mm-hmm.
User Interface: A shell shape.
Marketing: For the snail, yeah, mm-hmm,
Project Manager: Right, mm-hmm.
User Interface: Yes, yes.
Industrial Designer: Yeah. So it is {disfmarker}
Marketing: {vocalsound} we have the snail shell.
Project Manager: Mm-hmm.
User Interface: Yes, snail shell.
Industrial Designer: yeah,
Marketing: He goes right back into his shell.
Industrial Designer: yeah {disfmarker} shell.
Project Manager: Right.
User Interface: Yes.
Marketing: Well you know I think we could do something really funny with this too because the snail is known to be slow
Industrial Designer: Mm-hmm.
Marketing: and we could have some sort of little comic effect on our marketing about how this is a rapid snail or something like that
User Interface: Mm-hmm.
Industrial Designer: Mm.
User Interface: {vocalsound} Y Yes {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} Yeah, of course, yeah.
Marketing: you know that would, that would really work.
Project Manager: Now what, what are our special features for the marketing?
Marketing: So {disfmarker}
Project Manager: That's really the voice recognition that's really unusual {disfmarker}
Marketing: I think voice recognition is our big selling point
Industrial Designer: Mm. Mm-hmm.
Marketing:'cause nobody else seems to have that in in this price range.
Industrial Designer: Mm.
Project Manager: And then, and then the other thing would basically be sh shape or practicality of use.
Marketing: Yep
Project Manager: You know.
Marketing: uh well I think that everybody's gonna say their remote control is practical. I think we have to, we have to dwell on on on the appearance.
Project Manager: Colours. Mm-hmm.
Marketing: We're really gonna have the be the
Project Manager: Cutest.
Marketing: cutest remote control on the block.
Project Manager: Yeah.
Industrial Designer: Mm.
Marketing: So I think we have to play with the image, play with the snail image um play with the visual and then the voice recognition.
Industrial Designer: Mm-hmm.
Marketing: I think those are the two things to push. The look and the voice recognition. They're gonna be our two selling points.
Project Manager: Okay, now uh having said that {disfmarker}
Marketing: I'm supposed to make a little presentation, aren't I?
Project Manager: No, now this was our evaluation criteria which we uh just have done.
Marketing: Okay.
Project Manager: Now we're gonna talk about financing. {vocalsound}
Marketing: Ah, but in my instructions I think it said I was supposed to go to the board and do something.
Project Manager: {vocalsound} Well, there is a production evaluation.
Marketing: No?
Project Manager: Is that you?
Marketing: Yeah, that's me.
Project Manager: But that's after the financing.
Marketing: Oh, okay.
Project Manager: See? Fi see?
Marketing: Sorry, sorry. Mm-mm.
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Um. {vocalsound} Okay, we had looks and voice recognition. Okay now on the financing we bring up the mm there it is. Okay uh energy source we say that's battery, right?
Industrial Designer: Mm.
Marketing: That's right.
Project Manager: Okay, now. So we {disfmarker} I guess we use one.
User Interface: Yes.
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
Project Manager: What? T cell or chart you are trying to change is protected. Well, that's nice. She told me I could just ch change it here and then it would {disfmarker} It doesn't work. Hmm.
Marketing: Can you just fill it in in the yellow boxes? Or {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Oh, okay yeah, okay,
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
Project Manager: let's see. Okay, one, okay.
User Interface: Yes.
Project Manager: Oh go away. Um kinetic source so that's {disfmarker} in the energy source that's all we need.
Industrial Designer: Mm-hmm.
Project Manager: Uh electronics, simple chip on print? Is that's what we're using?
User Interface: Yes.
Industrial Designer: Yeah,
Project Manager: One of those?
Industrial Designer: yeah.
Project Manager: Come on. Okay, one. Uh regular chip on print. No. That's all we need, the one
Industrial Designer: No. Yeah.
Project Manager: {disfmarker} case, uncurved flat, single curved, double curved.
Marketing: Well. {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: This is a {disfmarker}
User Interface: Single curve? Mm.
Marketing: I guess it's double curved.
Project Manager: Double curved? One of those?
Marketing: Mm-hmm.
Project Manager: Case materi s supplements. Plastic we said, right?
User Interface: Plastic.
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
Project Manager: Uh wood, rubber?
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
Marketing: Rubber, because we're gonna have the soft buttons.
Project Manager: Uh but, yes but {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: I think uh that is uh f for rubbers that is uh {disfmarker} yeah case material.
Project Manager: That's just for the case material,
User Interface: Is this for the case? Yes.
Project Manager: so special colours though, we having that,
Marketing: Oh okay, the mm-hmm, mm'kay.
Project Manager: right?
User Interface: Yes.
Industrial Designer: Mm-hmm.
Marketing: Mm-hmm.
Project Manager: And then we have to interface push buttons.
User Interface: Yes.
Marketing: Mm-hmm.
Project Manager: Scroll wheel, no. Integrated scroll wheel, L_C_ display?
User Interface: No.
Marketing: No,
Project Manager: Button.
Marketing:'cause we didn't put the clock in it after all, right?
Project Manager: No.
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
Marketing: Mm-hmm.
Project Manager: Uh, button supplement special colour?
User Interface: Speci Yes
Project Manager: Special form?
User Interface: Yes d we do have special form.
Marketing: Yes.
Project Manager: And special material, rubber, wood, yes.
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
Project Manager: Okay. {vocalsound} Total seven point six whatever that means.
Industrial Designer: Uh, I think that's the price.
Project Manager: That's the price.
User Interface: One two three four five six seven eight nine
Project Manager: Mm?
Industrial Designer: Maybe it {disfmarker} is it just {disfmarker} n
Project Manager: Eight, eight point two. That's {disfmarker}
User Interface: Nine points,
Project Manager: hmm?
User Interface: okay, yes.
Project Manager: Eight point two, right? So, we {disfmarker} looks like we are well within budget.
User Interface: Okay.
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
Marketing: Mm-hmm.
Project Manager: Okay. I guess I should save this I suppose, huh?
Marketing: Yeah.
Project Manager: Oops. Uh-huh huh huh.
User Interface: On the desktop.
Project Manager: I just tried that. My documents, computer.
Industrial Designer: AMI.
Project Manager: My compu Ah oh here it is, yes.
Industrial Designer: AMI should for
Project Manager: Okay, fine. Save. Okay good, so that's the good news. We gonna be popular.
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
Marketing: Mm-hmm.
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: {vocalsound} Um. So that uh {disfmarker} I think financing was pretty simple.
Marketing: Mm-hmm.
Project Manager: Now we would like to have a presentation by the marketing expert on production evaluation.
Marketing: Okay, I'll take my file down so you can bring it up.'Kay should be able to get it now.'Kay, why don't you move just to the next slide right away.
Project Manager: You wanna go to the next slide?
Marketing: Yeah right away.
Project Manager: Okay.
Marketing: Okay, well uh obviously my method for uh s m the marketing of this thing is first to ask the big question, will it sell? And I think we should show this prototype to people from various age and socio-economic groups and see about any fine tuning that {disfmarker} maybe little things we haven't thought of.
User Interface: Okay.
Industrial Designer: Mm-hmm.
Marketing: We can't accept every suggestion of course, but maybe we just need to get a few.
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
Marketing: And show the the prototype to consumer research groups, we don't s want somebody to suddenly come to us and tell us that this button is toxic and you know some child will swallow it and then we won't sell any.
Industrial Designer: Mm-hmm. Mm.
Marketing: So we have to get some input from those people.
Industrial Designer: Mm-hmm.
Marketing: And then after that we just have to go with our best intuition and you know we like it, we think it's good, we're gonna get behind it and sell it. Um, next slide please. Okay, now the things that I was thinking and th my wish list has really been realised in this prototype. I wanted the shape to be biomorphic, I didn't want anything with angles and all square, I wanted it to be comfy and roundy so we we've got that. The size is small, the colour's bright and warm which is what we wanted. We wanted the feel to be as soft as possible, we'll have the soft buttons
Industrial Designer: Mm-hmm.
Marketing: and the way this is shaped, even though it's gonna be hard plastic, it feels good in your hand so that's nice. And functionality I put last on my list because people aren't going to use it before they buy it.
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Marketing: {vocalsound} So paradoxically the other features, in other words, the look, the feel um and the shape, that's what people are gonna get in the store.
User Interface: Fee selling.
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
Marketing: They don't have a television in the store, they can't play with it.
User Interface: Yes.
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
Marketing: Um so they'll be our main selling points. So um {vocalsound} th those have been fulfilled by your prototype and go ahead to the next slide please. Okay, so um the shape um I think is a {disfmarker} a one. That's really, really excellent shape. The size is small um and th these points are in the importance for the, for the marketing, these aren't i in how I feel. I think that it's {disfmarker} I think that it's plenty small enough to sell but I think we're sort of right {disfmarker} the scale is one to seven. I think we're sort of right in the middle as far as c other competitors.
User Interface: Okay.
Marketing: And our colour I think is great. The colours are bright and warm and we really do great job there. And given um the constraints that we had I think we got it as soft as possible. And then functionality um I think you did a really good job on functionality, obviously we could have ad added different functions but then we'd disturb something else so I would say that we got to a five out of seven on on functionality.
User Interface: Okay.
Industrial Designer: Mm-hmm.
Marketing: So I think that basically we've got a great product and we can get off and running with it.
Project Manager: Um I just realised one thing.
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
Project Manager: In the financing there was no room for our voice recogniser.
Marketing: Yes.
User Interface: Yes.
Marketing: Ah.
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
Project Manager: And uh I don't know how we can evaluate that or how we can include that, too.
Marketing: Well, um we had what, eight eight euros twenty as our cost?
Project Manager: Eight, eight twenty, yes.
Industrial Designer: Eight twenty so {disfmarker}
Marketing: And so we've got {disfmarker} we've still got four euros to go {disfmarker} to spend.
Industrial Designer: We have um four euros, yeah
Project Manager: I mean maximum we have another four point three euros I mean {vocalsound} four thirty.
Marketing: Mm-hmm. Well um that's {disfmarker}
Project Manager: But I mean we have no way of presenting that to management as you know as a f finished, as a finished product and saying okay with the voice recogniser that costs so much.
Marketing: Mm-hmm.
Project Manager: So um we just have to beware of that. I mean and know whether the four thirty will really cover that.
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
Marketing: Well as we know in today's technic technological world you can do just about anything at any price, the the the problem is quality.
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: Yeah {gap}.
Marketing: So we're just gonna have to settle for whatever quality that will buy us.
Industrial Designer: Yeah,
User Interface: Yes, yes.
Industrial Designer: yeah.
Marketing: And um it may not be the greatest quality but it may sell anyway.
Project Manager: Yeah.
Industrial Designer: Yeah, still.
Marketing: {vocalsound} As we've seen with so many of these kinds of products. {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: Yeah. {vocalsound}
Project Manager: I'm sorry to interrupt then but I just uh recog I just remembered that there was no {disfmarker} that that was not um included uh {disfmarker} that there was no room for any special features, okay?
Industrial Designer: Included, yeah. Hmm,
User Interface: Yeah mm.
Industrial Designer: hmm
Project Manager: So to beware of that. You wanna go to this next slide, marketing expert?
Marketing: Uh, well I isn't this my last slide?
Project Manager: I dunno.
Marketing: Maybe.
Project Manager: Yes it is. Mm-hmm.
Marketing: Go ahead. I think that was my last slide, yeah. Um. Mm okay. And I'm supposed to present this scale on the whiteboard. Um and we're supposed to talk about those things as a team now, so if you put my last slide back up there.
Project Manager: Oh.
Marketing: I'm sorry I've um forgot to do that, um.
Project Manager: Why? Wh why you need that up?
Marketing: Hmm? Well because I can't remember what I put on there. {vocalsound} Okay.
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Marketing: Now I'm supposed to see how long my leash is here.
Project Manager: I think you can make it there.
Marketing: Mm'kay. You ready. So now we're all supposed to say what we think. Um okay so on shape I gave it a one. Wait what would you ra uh one being good and seven being the worst.
User Interface: Worse, okay.
Marketing: Um what do you think the shape is?
User Interface: One.
Marketing: One, okay, and Be Betsy?
Project Manager: Yes I think uh shape is one.
Industrial Designer: Yeah, even my {disfmarker} yeah, shape is one.
Marketing: Okay, uh-huh one, okay. And how about on size? On size {disfmarker}
Project Manager: You {disfmarker} you gave it a four.
Marketing: I gave it a four, yeah, I feel it's just average.
Project Manager: Um, I dunno. I think I would give it at least a two.
Marketing: Okay.
User Interface: One.
Marketing: Mm-hmm.
Industrial Designer: Yeah, even I think it is one. It's quite small.
Marketing: Okay. Okay {vocalsound}
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Marketing: you're the designer, of course you wanna give it a one.
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} {vocalsound}
Marketing: {vocalsound} Um and then how about {disfmarker} how we doing on colour?
Project Manager: Colour uh I {disfmarker}
Marketing: Colour, I gave it a one.
Project Manager: One.
Marketing: I really like all those nice bright, warm colours.
Project Manager: I {disfmarker} I like the colours. One.
User Interface: One. Yes.
Marketing: One.
Industrial Designer: Yeah, one.
Marketing: One, one, one, okay. And how about the feel? Taking into um consideration texture and comfort in the hand.
Project Manager: Uh, I think I would give it a two.
Marketing: Okay, I gave it a three, two,
User Interface: I'll give three.
Marketing: yeah? Three.
Industrial Designer: Uh maybe two,
Marketing: Two, okay.
Industrial Designer: yeah.
Marketing: And the next is functionality where I I admit I was a little hard on our team here, but {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Well it's also you can't really try it out uh the other things you have have more {disfmarker} is {disfmarker} are more tangible so from that point of view
Marketing: Yeah. Mm-hmm.
Project Manager: but um {disfmarker} I'll give it a three.
Marketing: Okay.
User Interface: Two.
Marketing: Two, okay.
Industrial Designer: Uh three, mm-hmm.
Marketing: Three? Okay. Well, um. It looks like we've got got ourselves a pretty good product. Um the functionality's the only place where maybe we have to think about m m maybe, heaven forbid, having another meeting.
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} Yeah. {vocalsound}
Marketing: {vocalsound} But um otherwise I think we're {disfmarker} we're ready to go to {disfmarker} go with this product. Anybody else have any other comments or any other things that we feel we should evaluate?
Project Manager: Uh. Here is what we looking at uh satisfaction on for example room for creativity. Um. Is there more room for creativity or are we absolutely happy?
User Interface: We can always improve, yes.
Industrial Designer: Maybe we can {disfmarker} yeah, include some more buttons and uh um
User Interface: Yes, features.
Industrial Designer: yeah features. We can make the buttons {disfmarker} few buttons smaller. Uh I think they are quite big, so I think {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I mean we can just have small buttons and more buttons in that case. If we want to have more features than that.
Marketing: Mm-hmm. Well then again if we're gonna um {vocalsound} do the speech recognition thing we're gon there gonna be some buttons that are gonna have to be added for that for the recording of the the speech.
Industrial Designer: Yeah. Yeah, definitely.
User Interface: Yes. Voices.
Industrial Designer: Mm-hmm.
Marketing: So that that's where we're gonna have to do {disfmarker} maybe we can eliminate one of the mute buttons, instead of having two mute buttons.
Industrial Designer: Yeah, definitely, yeah, two mu mute buttons.
User Interface: Yes. Yes.
Marketing: And um then maybe we can do something with the um the volume control. Maybe we can put that all on one button.
Industrial Designer: Hmm.
Marketing: Um and a couple of other th maybe comp uh consolidate some of the usage an and see what we can do with that.
Project Manager: Y um al always bearing in mind that right now we are of course well within the budget
Industrial Designer: Mm-hmm.
User Interface: And maybe {disfmarker}
Project Manager: and that we still you know we probably can't, with this particular item, we probably can't just uh add a whole lot of more things.
Marketing: Mm-hmm. No.
Project Manager: Uh um we need uh {disfmarker} you know we need to leave space money-wise for the voice recogniser.
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
Marketing: Mm-hmm.
User Interface: Yes.
Marketing: Mm-hmm.
Project Manager: Um.
Industrial Designer: Mm-hmm.
Project Manager: So th the question really is how do we feel with the project process? Uh, um are we happy with the creativity that has passed here or we're not happy with the new product we created or that was created? Uh I think {disfmarker} personally I think uh I'm pretty happy.
Marketing: I'm pretty happy with it too, yeah um,
Project Manager: Um an
Industrial Designer: Even I'm happy.
Marketing: it's something I think I can market. Yeah.
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
Project Manager: and then the next question is are we happy with the leadership of this project? Uh {disfmarker}
Marketing: {vocalsound} I think you've done a good job, Miss leader. {vocalsound}
User Interface: Yes, yes you've done a good job.
Industrial Designer: Yeah, yeah, definitely. {vocalsound}
Project Manager: And I think team work I think was very very good, I think we really {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Mm-hmm.
Marketing: Yeah I d I do too I think we worked well together as a team, yeah. Mm-hmm.
Project Manager: yeah.
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
Project Manager: Mm-hmm.
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
Project Manager: And uh I think we {disfmarker} are we happy with the means we used? We used whiteboard, we didn't use digital p well digital pens I guess are these things.
Marketing: Yeah maybe we could've used the whiteboard a little bit more, yeah,
User Interface: Whiteboard more, yes, yes.
Industrial Designer: Yeah, probably.
Marketing: we didn't use that enough.
Project Manager: Yes, we could. Uh, it's maybe not in the best position in the room um you know like sometimes it's positioned so that it's much better visible for everybody and I think from that point of view we sort of ignored it a little bit.
Marketing: Mm-hmm.
User Interface: Yes.
Marketing: And we used the slide because it was better positioned.
Project Manager: {vocalsound} Yes, I think so, I think absolutely,
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
User Interface: No.
Marketing: Mm I think that's true mm-hmm.
Project Manager: and fortunately we all had slides presentation which made it a little easier.
Industrial Designer: Hmm.
Project Manager: Um did we new {disfmarker} did we find new ideas?
User Interface: Yes.
Marketing: Mm-hmm.
Project Manager: I think we did.
Industrial Designer: Yeah, many.
Marketing: I think we were we were very good, yeah, mm.
Project Manager: I think we we did, uh in more than one respect and uh so I think we did very well here.
Marketing: Mm-hmm. Okay.
Project Manager: Are the costs within budget? Yes, yes. Uh is the project evaluated? Yes.
Marketing: Yes, yes.
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
Project Manager: Um then celebration. {vocalsound}
Marketing: Celebration.
User Interface: Cel celebration {vocalsound} yes, yes. {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: Ah. {vocalsound}
Marketing: {vocalsound} Today we have apple juice and after we sell m million of'em we have champagne. {vocalsound}
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: So I {disfmarker} I thank you all very much. Um, I think this was very good and um
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
Marketing: Mm-hmm.
Project Manager: I think we did come up with a new product that's uh feasible. Feasible from the production point of view and feasible from a marketing point of view.
Marketing: Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.
Project Manager: So, thank you.
Marketing: Okay.
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
User Interface: Thank you.
Industrial Designer: Thank you very much.
Marketing: Okay. Watch I I have my cord behind you here.
User Interface: Okay.
Marketing: Okay.
Project Manager: I always get it on here, but getting it off is {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Do we {disfmarker} do we have some time left? Uh {disfmarker} you have {disfmarker}
User Interface: They say it's forty minutes.
Project Manager: Ah yes we have time later
Marketing: But we we were told we could end the final meeting at any time, whenever we felt we were finished.
Project Manager: but we don't {disfmarker}
User Interface: Okay.
Industrial Designer: Oh, alright.
Marketing: It'll take me the rest of the time to get my microphone out from my necklace. {vocalsound} Oh, there we go.","Making a recyclable and colourful case out of plastic that was strong without using harmful materials was proposed. For the components, there would be a resistor, a capacitor, a diode transistor, resonator, and if possible, a rechargeable battery. Also, it should have an integrated circuit board that was highly sophisticated, temperature resistant and inexpensive. Furthermore, it was hoped that there would be a timer or alarm. For the working design, morse code would be relayed to the generator for amplification after buttons were pressed. The team thought push buttons were better than scroll wheel as the former was more practical and cheap.",qmsum
"Summarize the whole meeting.
Project Manager: Well hi everyone again.
User Interface: Hello.
Industrial Designer: Hello.
Marketing: Hello
Project Manager: Um {vocalsound} like before we uh {disfmarker} I have to redo the meetings from {vocalsound} {disfmarker} n th the minutes from the last meeting
Marketing: Mm-hmm.
Project Manager: and so here we go. Uh it was discussed in the last meeting uh which was opened by the presentation from the interface um designer {vocalsound} that uh looks would be very important on this new remote
User Interface: Designer. {vocalsound}
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: and um it is to send messages of course to the T_V_. It should have nine channel buttons, a next button, volume buttons, subtitle buttons, switch to control features, colour contrast, sharpness etcetera. It should have a memory switch, a mute button in case the telephone rings or something. Uh speech recognition is one of her very f favourite personal uh features she would like see d d to be integrated in this um in this new remote. Um. {vocalsound} Should be child friendly design with few buttons, colourful maybe with s star shaped or other shaped buttons. Um she uh presented also an oversized remote which she guarantees nobody will ever be able to lose.
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Um {disfmarker}
Marketing: And she was challenged on that point {vocalsound}
Project Manager: {vocalsound} that's right. {vocalsound}
User Interface: {vocalsound} Yes. {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: But uh her very f personal favourite really she, she would very much like to see a speech recogniser integrated in this remote. The industrial designer um presented her uh {vocalsound} thoughts on the issue. She would like a special case made out of plastic that is very strong, not using any harmful materials, should be recyclable and should be colourful. Should have an integrated circuit board that's highly sophisticated and temperature resistant. She would like to see a timer and or alarm facility integrated. Uh technically this thing would also have a resistor and a capacitor, diode transistor, resonator, and if possible a rechargeable battery. Uh and of course a circuit board. And how it would works, you press the button, the chip is morse {disfmarker} morse code related relays the {disfmarker} uh to the generat to the generator amplification and uh the circuit board is very inexpensive to build and so she thinks this is a great feature uh to to to consider.
Marketing: Okay.
Project Manager: She would like uh {disfmarker} this whole thing should be push buttons with a simple chip uh scrolling method is more expensive and not that practical anymore. Should be battery operated and of course she would have the special cases. The marketing expert uh who has to finally come up with {disfmarker} to to to market this product has been watching the competition, has done some research on the internet and also has used h her personal observations to come up with the fact that such a remote sh should be small, easy to use and it should be eye catching. From her point of view of course one of the most important facts is that we should get to market before our competition does. To do that uh maybe one or two features should be developed on which we could dwell on or in other words on which our campaign could be built on. Too many new features or too many points would only confuse matter. So we prefer to have one or two features that can be really uh driven home. Um it should have a fruit and vegetable design and should have a soft feel. She feels that's really what people want today. And the decision that we took last time was that uh the special feature we would like to see is a speech recogniser, the energy should be battery uh should be on a chip, should be trendy design, compact and strong, and should have buttons. And that concludes the presentation from the last minutes {disfmarker} from the last meeting. Now uh we are ready for the presentation of the prototype.
User Interface: Yeah.
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
User Interface: Just the look like, the button part I'll explain.
Industrial Designer: Yeah. Uh so this is our {disfmarker} what uh we have made. This is a model of the remote control which we are going to build.
Project Manager: Mm-hmm.
Industrial Designer: Uh this is us in a snail shape so uh it it is attractive
Marketing: Mm-hmm.
Industrial Designer: um and it's {disfmarker} it's blue in colour uh bright and uh it has yellow buttons and all the different colour buttons
Marketing: Mm-hmm.
Industrial Designer: so it is a {disfmarker} uh uh a {disfmarker} looks-wise it is beautiful.
Marketing: Mm-hmm.
Industrial Designer: Uh and also compact in shape.
Marketing: Mm-hmm.
Industrial Designer: Uh um and also i it it will be easily fit into {disfmarker} into the hands and you can access all the buttons easily.
Marketing: Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Good.
Industrial Designer: Yeah,
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: oops, sorry. {vocalsound}
Marketing: {vocalsound} You used to have all the buttons {vocalsound}
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} Um yeah and um uh the material which we are going to use for the case is uh plastic and uh w which which is s strong um uh and also uh for the {disfmarker} Um the material is plastic and uh for the buttons it is uh s soft rubber um and als
Marketing: Oh that's good,
Industrial Designer: yeah.
Marketing: no, that's nice and friendly.
Industrial Designer: Yeah because uh uh you'll be touching the buttons more so it is soft when you touch it.
Marketing: Mm-hmm. Mm.
Project Manager: Mm-hmm,
Marketing: Mm-hmm.
Project Manager: mm-hmm.
Industrial Designer: And then um uh for the {disfmarker} for the led, for the light emitting diode it is a fluorescent green
Marketing: Mm-hmm.
Industrial Designer: and it's a {disfmarker} a {disfmarker} it is a bulb like an ordinary infrared.
Marketing: Mm-hmm.
Industrial Designer: And {disfmarker} and the button {disfmarker} button's part uh will be explained by F Francina.
User Interface: Okay.
Marketing: Okay.
User Interface: Now the um {disfmarker} we decided upon including certain features on our remote. Now these features includes the s um signal emitting uh signal {disfmarker} it's the led or L_E_D_ the infrared.
Project Manager: Mm-hmm,
Marketing: Yeah, okay, mm-hmm.
Project Manager: mm-hmm.
User Interface: Now uh we have included the switch on and off button.
Marketing: Mm-hmm.
User Interface: Now we have included another feature that is the mute button
Marketing: Mm-hmm.
User Interface: on the side of the model. Then we have included one to nine buttons
Marketing: Mm-hmm.
User Interface: for controlling the programmes {disfmarker} the different channels.
Marketing: Mm-hmm.
User Interface: We have also included two buttons for increasing or decreasing the volume.
Marketing: Mm-hmm.
User Interface: And we have also included two buttons for scrolling up and scrolling down the programme channels. Now our {disfmarker} our model also contains a button which is called as the menu button.
Marketing: Mm.
Project Manager: What kind of button?
User Interface: Menu button.
Project Manager: Menu? Uh menu th menu, uh one one.
User Interface: Yes, menu {disfmarker}
Marketing: Menu button. {vocalsound}
User Interface: At the centre
Marketing: Mm-hmm.
User Interface: we have included a button which is fluorescent green colour and this is the menu button which will control the colour, sharpness, brightness
Marketing: Mm-hmm. Of the screen. Mm, mm-hmm.
User Interface: of this uh picture. We have also included a button which is called as the swapping button. Now this is uh a special, special feature which we have included. Now this button is an elongated shaped button and this is slightly flexible so if it is turned towards the right it will take to the previous channel, if it is turned towards the right it will take to the next channel. It will take the user to the previous and the next channel so this is a swapping button.
Marketing: The next channel in the numeric pattern, or {disfmarker}
User Interface: No, swapping is if if example you're {disfmarker} you're watching the second channel and then you go to the tenth channel and if you want to go back to the second channel you can swap, this button.
Marketing: Yeah, mm-hmm. Mm.
User Interface: Yes.
Marketing: Okay, okay.
User Interface: And at the end, it {disfmarker} this remote has inbuilt voice recogniser which c which will recognise the user's voice and then it'll act accordingly.
Project Manager: Okay. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.
User Interface: So this is our proposed model.
Marketing: Okay.
User Interface: Now the marketing expert has to
Marketing: Mm-hmm.
Industrial Designer: Tell, yeah.
User Interface: give her suggestion whether it'll be sellable {vocalsound} or it'll be cost effective.
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Marketing: {vocalsound} Okay, well um what {disfmarker} what I really like a lot about it is that you can reach the whole thing with one thumb,
User Interface: Yes, yes.
Marketing: that you can really hold it in one h you don't need two hands
Industrial Designer: Mm-hmm.
Marketing: and it's easily reachable even for somebody with a small hand, yeah?
Project Manager: Yes the buttons are all raised, right?
Marketing: The buttons are all raised
Project Manager: Are raised, mm-hmm.
User Interface: Yes.
Marketing: and if you hold it in the centre of your hand you can even reach it over here so you don't have to turn it around, turn it upside down, move it up, up and down,
Project Manager: Right. Or have two hands to operate it, yeah.
Marketing: I really like that.
User Interface: Mm.
Industrial Designer: Mm-hmm.
Marketing: You really did a good job on that, my little designers.
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Marketing: {vocalsound} Um and um I like the idea that the on-off button is in a really prominent place. That's that's a really good good thing.
Project Manager: Yes, and it sort of sticks up so that you really {disfmarker}
Marketing: Yeah, that's great.
Project Manager: you don't have to g first go like oh yeah here it's on and yeah, mm-hmm.
Industrial Designer: Hmm. Mm-hmm.
Marketing: Mm-hmm.
User Interface: Abs okay.
Marketing: The colour's very attractive. Um the um these buttons uh around here are the mute
User Interface: No, these {disfmarker} the front buttons which are here, are the mute buttons.
Marketing: and {disfmarker} these {disfmarker} mm-hmm On both sides they're mute?
User Interface: Yes, yes.
Marketing: So you can push either one?
User Interface: Yes.
Marketing: Okay.
Project Manager: So if you're left-handed or right-handed it doesn't matter.
Marketing: And this brings the menu up on the screen?
User Interface: {vocalsound} Pardon me? This is the menu {disfmarker} yes, yes.
Marketing: This brings the menu up on the screen and the orange ones are {disfmarker}
User Interface: A the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} these {disfmarker} these two are th to increase or decrease the volumes,
Marketing: Okay.
User Interface: and these two are to uh scroll the programme channels.
Marketing: F f okay.
User Interface: Scroll up or scroll down the channels.
Marketing: Right, very good. Uh it looks mm looks like something I can sell.
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Marketing: Okay and now I'm supposed to {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Well, I have one question
Marketing: yeah.
Project Manager: uh will there be anything written on the buttons, like that people know, or they have to learn that from a piece of paper which button does what?
User Interface: Yes, it will have uh {disfmarker} these buttons will have the numbers and all the rest of the buttons will have symbols.
Industrial Designer: Ah. Yeah, definitely.
Project Manager: Will have symbols so that that {disfmarker} that the user really knows you know and doesn't have to first learn it {disfmarker}
User Interface: Yes, which can be easily recognised.
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
Marketing: Yeah.
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
User Interface: Yes.
Industrial Designer: Yeah. Yeah.
Marketing: Good point because we need the symbols'cause we're going into an international market we can't have anything that's language dependent.
User Interface: Yes.
Industrial Designer: Yeah of course, and also {disfmarker}
User Interface: Yes.
Industrial Designer: Hmm.
Project Manager: Yeah. But anyway it would ha i i i it has to have some kind of of symbols, text or something so that people kn
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
User Interface: Yes.
Industrial Designer: Yeah we can {disfmarker} Text.
Marketing: Symbols on it. Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.
User Interface: Yes.
Industrial Designer: Text that we can have on the case itself,
Project Manager: That's right.
User Interface: Yes.
Industrial Designer: we can {disfmarker} it will be printed on the case and symbols as well as the buttons. Yeah.
Marketing: Mm-hmm.
Project Manager: Okay, yeah just wanted make sure of that mm-hmm.
User Interface: And {disfmarker} and one more feature is we we have a holder for this remote which is an oyster shape.
Marketing: Mm,'kay, mm. Mm-hmm.
User Interface: A shell shape.
Marketing: For the snail, yeah, mm-hmm,
Project Manager: Right, mm-hmm.
User Interface: Yes, yes.
Industrial Designer: Yeah. So it is {disfmarker}
Marketing: {vocalsound} we have the snail shell.
Project Manager: Mm-hmm.
User Interface: Yes, snail shell.
Industrial Designer: yeah,
Marketing: He goes right back into his shell.
Industrial Designer: yeah {disfmarker} shell.
Project Manager: Right.
User Interface: Yes.
Marketing: Well you know I think we could do something really funny with this too because the snail is known to be slow
Industrial Designer: Mm-hmm.
Marketing: and we could have some sort of little comic effect on our marketing about how this is a rapid snail or something like that
User Interface: Mm-hmm.
Industrial Designer: Mm.
User Interface: {vocalsound} Y Yes {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} Yeah, of course, yeah.
Marketing: you know that would, that would really work.
Project Manager: Now what, what are our special features for the marketing?
Marketing: So {disfmarker}
Project Manager: That's really the voice recognition that's really unusual {disfmarker}
Marketing: I think voice recognition is our big selling point
Industrial Designer: Mm. Mm-hmm.
Marketing:'cause nobody else seems to have that in in this price range.
Industrial Designer: Mm.
Project Manager: And then, and then the other thing would basically be sh shape or practicality of use.
Marketing: Yep
Project Manager: You know.
Marketing: uh well I think that everybody's gonna say their remote control is practical. I think we have to, we have to dwell on on on the appearance.
Project Manager: Colours. Mm-hmm.
Marketing: We're really gonna have the be the
Project Manager: Cutest.
Marketing: cutest remote control on the block.
Project Manager: Yeah.
Industrial Designer: Mm.
Marketing: So I think we have to play with the image, play with the snail image um play with the visual and then the voice recognition.
Industrial Designer: Mm-hmm.
Marketing: I think those are the two things to push. The look and the voice recognition. They're gonna be our two selling points.
Project Manager: Okay, now uh having said that {disfmarker}
Marketing: I'm supposed to make a little presentation, aren't I?
Project Manager: No, now this was our evaluation criteria which we uh just have done.
Marketing: Okay.
Project Manager: Now we're gonna talk about financing. {vocalsound}
Marketing: Ah, but in my instructions I think it said I was supposed to go to the board and do something.
Project Manager: {vocalsound} Well, there is a production evaluation.
Marketing: No?
Project Manager: Is that you?
Marketing: Yeah, that's me.
Project Manager: But that's after the financing.
Marketing: Oh, okay.
Project Manager: See? Fi see?
Marketing: Sorry, sorry. Mm-mm.
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Um. {vocalsound} Okay, we had looks and voice recognition. Okay now on the financing we bring up the mm there it is. Okay uh energy source we say that's battery, right?
Industrial Designer: Mm.
Marketing: That's right.
Project Manager: Okay, now. So we {disfmarker} I guess we use one.
User Interface: Yes.
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
Project Manager: What? T cell or chart you are trying to change is protected. Well, that's nice. She told me I could just ch change it here and then it would {disfmarker} It doesn't work. Hmm.
Marketing: Can you just fill it in in the yellow boxes? Or {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Oh, okay yeah, okay,
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
Project Manager: let's see. Okay, one, okay.
User Interface: Yes.
Project Manager: Oh go away. Um kinetic source so that's {disfmarker} in the energy source that's all we need.
Industrial Designer: Mm-hmm.
Project Manager: Uh electronics, simple chip on print? Is that's what we're using?
User Interface: Yes.
Industrial Designer: Yeah,
Project Manager: One of those?
Industrial Designer: yeah.
Project Manager: Come on. Okay, one. Uh regular chip on print. No. That's all we need, the one
Industrial Designer: No. Yeah.
Project Manager: {disfmarker} case, uncurved flat, single curved, double curved.
Marketing: Well. {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: This is a {disfmarker}
User Interface: Single curve? Mm.
Marketing: I guess it's double curved.
Project Manager: Double curved? One of those?
Marketing: Mm-hmm.
Project Manager: Case materi s supplements. Plastic we said, right?
User Interface: Plastic.
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
Project Manager: Uh wood, rubber?
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
Marketing: Rubber, because we're gonna have the soft buttons.
Project Manager: Uh but, yes but {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: I think uh that is uh f for rubbers that is uh {disfmarker} yeah case material.
Project Manager: That's just for the case material,
User Interface: Is this for the case? Yes.
Project Manager: so special colours though, we having that,
Marketing: Oh okay, the mm-hmm, mm'kay.
Project Manager: right?
User Interface: Yes.
Industrial Designer: Mm-hmm.
Marketing: Mm-hmm.
Project Manager: And then we have to interface push buttons.
User Interface: Yes.
Marketing: Mm-hmm.
Project Manager: Scroll wheel, no. Integrated scroll wheel, L_C_ display?
User Interface: No.
Marketing: No,
Project Manager: Button.
Marketing:'cause we didn't put the clock in it after all, right?
Project Manager: No.
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
Marketing: Mm-hmm.
Project Manager: Uh, button supplement special colour?
User Interface: Speci Yes
Project Manager: Special form?
User Interface: Yes d we do have special form.
Marketing: Yes.
Project Manager: And special material, rubber, wood, yes.
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
Project Manager: Okay. {vocalsound} Total seven point six whatever that means.
Industrial Designer: Uh, I think that's the price.
Project Manager: That's the price.
User Interface: One two three four five six seven eight nine
Project Manager: Mm?
Industrial Designer: Maybe it {disfmarker} is it just {disfmarker} n
Project Manager: Eight, eight point two. That's {disfmarker}
User Interface: Nine points,
Project Manager: hmm?
User Interface: okay, yes.
Project Manager: Eight point two, right? So, we {disfmarker} looks like we are well within budget.
User Interface: Okay.
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
Marketing: Mm-hmm.
Project Manager: Okay. I guess I should save this I suppose, huh?
Marketing: Yeah.
Project Manager: Oops. Uh-huh huh huh.
User Interface: On the desktop.
Project Manager: I just tried that. My documents, computer.
Industrial Designer: AMI.
Project Manager: My compu Ah oh here it is, yes.
Industrial Designer: AMI should for
Project Manager: Okay, fine. Save. Okay good, so that's the good news. We gonna be popular.
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
Marketing: Mm-hmm.
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: {vocalsound} Um. So that uh {disfmarker} I think financing was pretty simple.
Marketing: Mm-hmm.
Project Manager: Now we would like to have a presentation by the marketing expert on production evaluation.
Marketing: Okay, I'll take my file down so you can bring it up.'Kay should be able to get it now.'Kay, why don't you move just to the next slide right away.
Project Manager: You wanna go to the next slide?
Marketing: Yeah right away.
Project Manager: Okay.
Marketing: Okay, well uh obviously my method for uh s m the marketing of this thing is first to ask the big question, will it sell? And I think we should show this prototype to people from various age and socio-economic groups and see about any fine tuning that {disfmarker} maybe little things we haven't thought of.
User Interface: Okay.
Industrial Designer: Mm-hmm.
Marketing: We can't accept every suggestion of course, but maybe we just need to get a few.
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
Marketing: And show the the prototype to consumer research groups, we don't s want somebody to suddenly come to us and tell us that this button is toxic and you know some child will swallow it and then we won't sell any.
Industrial Designer: Mm-hmm. Mm.
Marketing: So we have to get some input from those people.
Industrial Designer: Mm-hmm.
Marketing: And then after that we just have to go with our best intuition and you know we like it, we think it's good, we're gonna get behind it and sell it. Um, next slide please. Okay, now the things that I was thinking and th my wish list has really been realised in this prototype. I wanted the shape to be biomorphic, I didn't want anything with angles and all square, I wanted it to be comfy and roundy so we we've got that. The size is small, the colour's bright and warm which is what we wanted. We wanted the feel to be as soft as possible, we'll have the soft buttons
Industrial Designer: Mm-hmm.
Marketing: and the way this is shaped, even though it's gonna be hard plastic, it feels good in your hand so that's nice. And functionality I put last on my list because people aren't going to use it before they buy it.
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Marketing: {vocalsound} So paradoxically the other features, in other words, the look, the feel um and the shape, that's what people are gonna get in the store.
User Interface: Fee selling.
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
Marketing: They don't have a television in the store, they can't play with it.
User Interface: Yes.
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
Marketing: Um so they'll be our main selling points. So um {vocalsound} th those have been fulfilled by your prototype and go ahead to the next slide please. Okay, so um the shape um I think is a {disfmarker} a one. That's really, really excellent shape. The size is small um and th these points are in the importance for the, for the marketing, these aren't i in how I feel. I think that it's {disfmarker} I think that it's plenty small enough to sell but I think we're sort of right {disfmarker} the scale is one to seven. I think we're sort of right in the middle as far as c other competitors.
User Interface: Okay.
Marketing: And our colour I think is great. The colours are bright and warm and we really do great job there. And given um the constraints that we had I think we got it as soft as possible. And then functionality um I think you did a really good job on functionality, obviously we could have ad added different functions but then we'd disturb something else so I would say that we got to a five out of seven on on functionality.
User Interface: Okay.
Industrial Designer: Mm-hmm.
Marketing: So I think that basically we've got a great product and we can get off and running with it.
Project Manager: Um I just realised one thing.
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
Project Manager: In the financing there was no room for our voice recogniser.
Marketing: Yes.
User Interface: Yes.
Marketing: Ah.
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
Project Manager: And uh I don't know how we can evaluate that or how we can include that, too.
Marketing: Well, um we had what, eight eight euros twenty as our cost?
Project Manager: Eight, eight twenty, yes.
Industrial Designer: Eight twenty so {disfmarker}
Marketing: And so we've got {disfmarker} we've still got four euros to go {disfmarker} to spend.
Industrial Designer: We have um four euros, yeah
Project Manager: I mean maximum we have another four point three euros I mean {vocalsound} four thirty.
Marketing: Mm-hmm. Well um that's {disfmarker}
Project Manager: But I mean we have no way of presenting that to management as you know as a f finished, as a finished product and saying okay with the voice recogniser that costs so much.
Marketing: Mm-hmm.
Project Manager: So um we just have to beware of that. I mean and know whether the four thirty will really cover that.
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
Marketing: Well as we know in today's technic technological world you can do just about anything at any price, the the the problem is quality.
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: Yeah {gap}.
Marketing: So we're just gonna have to settle for whatever quality that will buy us.
Industrial Designer: Yeah,
User Interface: Yes, yes.
Industrial Designer: yeah.
Marketing: And um it may not be the greatest quality but it may sell anyway.
Project Manager: Yeah.
Industrial Designer: Yeah, still.
Marketing: {vocalsound} As we've seen with so many of these kinds of products. {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: Yeah. {vocalsound}
Project Manager: I'm sorry to interrupt then but I just uh recog I just remembered that there was no {disfmarker} that that was not um included uh {disfmarker} that there was no room for any special features, okay?
Industrial Designer: Included, yeah. Hmm,
User Interface: Yeah mm.
Industrial Designer: hmm
Project Manager: So to beware of that. You wanna go to this next slide, marketing expert?
Marketing: Uh, well I isn't this my last slide?
Project Manager: I dunno.
Marketing: Maybe.
Project Manager: Yes it is. Mm-hmm.
Marketing: Go ahead. I think that was my last slide, yeah. Um. Mm okay. And I'm supposed to present this scale on the whiteboard. Um and we're supposed to talk about those things as a team now, so if you put my last slide back up there.
Project Manager: Oh.
Marketing: I'm sorry I've um forgot to do that, um.
Project Manager: Why? Wh why you need that up?
Marketing: Hmm? Well because I can't remember what I put on there. {vocalsound} Okay.
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Marketing: Now I'm supposed to see how long my leash is here.
Project Manager: I think you can make it there.
Marketing: Mm'kay. You ready. So now we're all supposed to say what we think. Um okay so on shape I gave it a one. Wait what would you ra uh one being good and seven being the worst.
User Interface: Worse, okay.
Marketing: Um what do you think the shape is?
User Interface: One.
Marketing: One, okay, and Be Betsy?
Project Manager: Yes I think uh shape is one.
Industrial Designer: Yeah, even my {disfmarker} yeah, shape is one.
Marketing: Okay, uh-huh one, okay. And how about on size? On size {disfmarker}
Project Manager: You {disfmarker} you gave it a four.
Marketing: I gave it a four, yeah, I feel it's just average.
Project Manager: Um, I dunno. I think I would give it at least a two.
Marketing: Okay.
User Interface: One.
Marketing: Mm-hmm.
Industrial Designer: Yeah, even I think it is one. It's quite small.
Marketing: Okay. Okay {vocalsound}
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Marketing: you're the designer, of course you wanna give it a one.
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} {vocalsound}
Marketing: {vocalsound} Um and then how about {disfmarker} how we doing on colour?
Project Manager: Colour uh I {disfmarker}
Marketing: Colour, I gave it a one.
Project Manager: One.
Marketing: I really like all those nice bright, warm colours.
Project Manager: I {disfmarker} I like the colours. One.
User Interface: One. Yes.
Marketing: One.
Industrial Designer: Yeah, one.
Marketing: One, one, one, okay. And how about the feel? Taking into um consideration texture and comfort in the hand.
Project Manager: Uh, I think I would give it a two.
Marketing: Okay, I gave it a three, two,
User Interface: I'll give three.
Marketing: yeah? Three.
Industrial Designer: Uh maybe two,
Marketing: Two, okay.
Industrial Designer: yeah.
Marketing: And the next is functionality where I I admit I was a little hard on our team here, but {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Well it's also you can't really try it out uh the other things you have have more {disfmarker} is {disfmarker} are more tangible so from that point of view
Marketing: Yeah. Mm-hmm.
Project Manager: but um {disfmarker} I'll give it a three.
Marketing: Okay.
User Interface: Two.
Marketing: Two, okay.
Industrial Designer: Uh three, mm-hmm.
Marketing: Three? Okay. Well, um. It looks like we've got got ourselves a pretty good product. Um the functionality's the only place where maybe we have to think about m m maybe, heaven forbid, having another meeting.
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} Yeah. {vocalsound}
Marketing: {vocalsound} But um otherwise I think we're {disfmarker} we're ready to go to {disfmarker} go with this product. Anybody else have any other comments or any other things that we feel we should evaluate?
Project Manager: Uh. Here is what we looking at uh satisfaction on for example room for creativity. Um. Is there more room for creativity or are we absolutely happy?
User Interface: We can always improve, yes.
Industrial Designer: Maybe we can {disfmarker} yeah, include some more buttons and uh um
User Interface: Yes, features.
Industrial Designer: yeah features. We can make the buttons {disfmarker} few buttons smaller. Uh I think they are quite big, so I think {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I mean we can just have small buttons and more buttons in that case. If we want to have more features than that.
Marketing: Mm-hmm. Well then again if we're gonna um {vocalsound} do the speech recognition thing we're gon there gonna be some buttons that are gonna have to be added for that for the recording of the the speech.
Industrial Designer: Yeah. Yeah, definitely.
User Interface: Yes. Voices.
Industrial Designer: Mm-hmm.
Marketing: So that that's where we're gonna have to do {disfmarker} maybe we can eliminate one of the mute buttons, instead of having two mute buttons.
Industrial Designer: Yeah, definitely, yeah, two mu mute buttons.
User Interface: Yes. Yes.
Marketing: And um then maybe we can do something with the um the volume control. Maybe we can put that all on one button.
Industrial Designer: Hmm.
Marketing: Um and a couple of other th maybe comp uh consolidate some of the usage an and see what we can do with that.
Project Manager: Y um al always bearing in mind that right now we are of course well within the budget
Industrial Designer: Mm-hmm.
User Interface: And maybe {disfmarker}
Project Manager: and that we still you know we probably can't, with this particular item, we probably can't just uh add a whole lot of more things.
Marketing: Mm-hmm. No.
Project Manager: Uh um we need uh {disfmarker} you know we need to leave space money-wise for the voice recogniser.
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
Marketing: Mm-hmm.
User Interface: Yes.
Marketing: Mm-hmm.
Project Manager: Um.
Industrial Designer: Mm-hmm.
Project Manager: So th the question really is how do we feel with the project process? Uh, um are we happy with the creativity that has passed here or we're not happy with the new product we created or that was created? Uh I think {disfmarker} personally I think uh I'm pretty happy.
Marketing: I'm pretty happy with it too, yeah um,
Project Manager: Um an
Industrial Designer: Even I'm happy.
Marketing: it's something I think I can market. Yeah.
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
Project Manager: and then the next question is are we happy with the leadership of this project? Uh {disfmarker}
Marketing: {vocalsound} I think you've done a good job, Miss leader. {vocalsound}
User Interface: Yes, yes you've done a good job.
Industrial Designer: Yeah, yeah, definitely. {vocalsound}
Project Manager: And I think team work I think was very very good, I think we really {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Mm-hmm.
Marketing: Yeah I d I do too I think we worked well together as a team, yeah. Mm-hmm.
Project Manager: yeah.
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
Project Manager: Mm-hmm.
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
Project Manager: And uh I think we {disfmarker} are we happy with the means we used? We used whiteboard, we didn't use digital p well digital pens I guess are these things.
Marketing: Yeah maybe we could've used the whiteboard a little bit more, yeah,
User Interface: Whiteboard more, yes, yes.
Industrial Designer: Yeah, probably.
Marketing: we didn't use that enough.
Project Manager: Yes, we could. Uh, it's maybe not in the best position in the room um you know like sometimes it's positioned so that it's much better visible for everybody and I think from that point of view we sort of ignored it a little bit.
Marketing: Mm-hmm.
User Interface: Yes.
Marketing: And we used the slide because it was better positioned.
Project Manager: {vocalsound} Yes, I think so, I think absolutely,
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
User Interface: No.
Marketing: Mm I think that's true mm-hmm.
Project Manager: and fortunately we all had slides presentation which made it a little easier.
Industrial Designer: Hmm.
Project Manager: Um did we new {disfmarker} did we find new ideas?
User Interface: Yes.
Marketing: Mm-hmm.
Project Manager: I think we did.
Industrial Designer: Yeah, many.
Marketing: I think we were we were very good, yeah, mm.
Project Manager: I think we we did, uh in more than one respect and uh so I think we did very well here.
Marketing: Mm-hmm. Okay.
Project Manager: Are the costs within budget? Yes, yes. Uh is the project evaluated? Yes.
Marketing: Yes, yes.
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
Project Manager: Um then celebration. {vocalsound}
Marketing: Celebration.
User Interface: Cel celebration {vocalsound} yes, yes. {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: Ah. {vocalsound}
Marketing: {vocalsound} Today we have apple juice and after we sell m million of'em we have champagne. {vocalsound}
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: So I {disfmarker} I thank you all very much. Um, I think this was very good and um
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
Marketing: Mm-hmm.
Project Manager: I think we did come up with a new product that's uh feasible. Feasible from the production point of view and feasible from a marketing point of view.
Marketing: Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.
Project Manager: So, thank you.
Marketing: Okay.
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
User Interface: Thank you.
Industrial Designer: Thank you very much.
Marketing: Okay. Watch I I have my cord behind you here.
User Interface: Okay.
Marketing: Okay.
Project Manager: I always get it on here, but getting it off is {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Do we {disfmarker} do we have some time left? Uh {disfmarker} you have {disfmarker}
User Interface: They say it's forty minutes.
Project Manager: Ah yes we have time later
Marketing: But we we were told we could end the final meeting at any time, whenever we felt we were finished.
Project Manager: but we don't {disfmarker}
User Interface: Okay.
Industrial Designer: Oh, alright.
Marketing: It'll take me the rest of the time to get my microphone out from my necklace. {vocalsound} Oh, there we go.","Project Manager first recapped the previous meeting, concluding that the remote should be compact, user-friendly and could function like speech recognition. Next, the presentation of the bright blue snail shaped prototype was made by Industrial Designer and User Interface, introducing the appearance and features of the remote. Then, feedback was given regarding the prototype, which was mainly positive and speech recognition and cute appearance were decided as its star feature. Afterwards, the team discussed the financing of the remote, which should be within the budget of twelve fifty euros. Finally, the meeting ended with a project evaluation, which everyone was satisfied with the product and dynamic of the team, and team building.",qmsum
"Summarize the meeting
PhD B: OK. We're on.
Grad E: Hello?
Professor A: OK, so uh {vocalsound} had some interesting mail from uh Dan Ellis. Actually, I think he {disfmarker} he {vocalsound} redirected it to everybody also so uh {vocalsound} the PDA mikes uh have a big bunch of energy at {disfmarker} at uh five hertz uh where this came up was that uh I was showing off these wave forms that we have on the web and {disfmarker} and uh {vocalsound} I just sort of hadn't noticed this, but that {disfmarker} the major, major component in the wave {disfmarker} in the second wave form in that pair of wave forms is actually the air conditioner.
Grad C: Huh.
Professor A: So. So. I {vocalsound} {vocalsound} I have to be more careful about using that as a {disfmarker} as a {disfmarker} {vocalsound} as a good illustration, uh, in fact it's not, of uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} of the effects of room reverberation. It is isn't a bad illustration of the effects of uh room noise. {vocalsound} on {disfmarker} on uh some mikes uh but So. And then we had this other discussion about um {vocalsound} whether this affects the dynamic range, cuz I know, although we start off with thirty two bits, you end up with uh sixteen bits and {vocalsound} you know, are we getting hurt there? But uh Dan is pretty confident that we're not, that {disfmarker} that quantization error is not {disfmarker} is still not a significant {vocalsound} factor there. So. So there was a question of whether we should change things here, whether we should {vocalsound} change a capacitor on the input box for that or whether we should
PhD B: Yeah, he suggested a smaller capacitor, right?
Professor A: Right. But then I had some other uh thing discussions with him
PhD B: For the P D
Professor A: and the feeling was {vocalsound} once we start monk monkeying with that, uh, many other problems could ha happen. And additionally we {disfmarker} we already have a lot of data that's been collected with that, so.
PhD B: Yeah.
Professor A: A simple thing to do is he {disfmarker} he {disfmarker} he has a {disfmarker} I forget if it {disfmarker} this was in that mail or in the following mail, but he has a {disfmarker} a simple filter, a digital filter that he suggested. We just run over the data before we deal with it.
PhD B: Mm - hmm.
Professor A: um The other thing that I don't know the answer to, but when people are using Feacalc here, uh whether they're using it with the high - pass filter option or not. And I don't know if anybody knows.
Grad E: Um. {vocalsound} I could go check.
Professor A: But. Yeah. So when we're doing all these things using our software there is {disfmarker} um if it's {disfmarker} if it's based on the RASTA - PLP program, {vocalsound} which does both PLP and RASTA - PLP {vocalsound} um then {vocalsound} uh there is an option there which then comes up through to Feacalc which {vocalsound} um allows you to do high - pass filtering and in general we like to do that, because of things like this and {vocalsound} it's {disfmarker} it's pretty {disfmarker} it's not a very severe filter. Doesn't affect speech frequencies, even pretty low speech frequencies, at all, but it's
PhD B: What's the {pause} cut - off frequency it used?
Professor A: Oh. I don't know I wrote this a while ago
PhD B: Is it like twenty?
Professor A: Something like that.
PhD B: Yeah.
Professor A: Yeah. I mean I think there's some effect above twenty but it's {disfmarker} it's {disfmarker} it's {disfmarker} it's mild. So, I mean it probably {disfmarker} there's probably some effect up to a hundred hertz or something but it's {disfmarker} it's pretty mild. I don't know in the {disfmarker} in the STRUT implementation of the stuff is there a high - pass filter or a pre pre - emphasis or something in the {disfmarker}
PhD F: Uh. I think we use a pre - emphasis. Yeah. Yeah.
Professor A: So. We {disfmarker} we {disfmarker} we want to go and check that in i for anything that we're going to use the P D A mike for. {vocalsound} uh He says that there's a pretty good roll off in the PZM mikes so {vocalsound} we don't need {disfmarker} need to worry about them one way or the other but if we do make use of the cheap mikes, {vocalsound} uh we want to be sure to do that {disfmarker} that filtering before we {vocalsound} process it. And then again if it's uh depending on the option that the {disfmarker} our {disfmarker} our software is being run with, it's {disfmarker} it's quite possible that's already being taken care of. uh But I also have to pick a different picture to show the effects of reverberation. uh
PhD B: Did somebody notice it during your talk?
Professor A: uh No.
PhD B: Huh.
Professor A: Well. uh Well. If they made output they were {disfmarker} they were, you know {disfmarker} they were nice.
PhD B: Didn't say anything?
Professor A: But. {vocalsound} I mean the thing is it was since I was talking about reverberation and showing this thing that was noise, it wasn't a good match, but it certainly was still uh an indication of the fact that you get noise with distant mikes. uh It's just not a great example because not only isn't it reverberation but it's a noise that we definitely know what to do.
PhD B: Mm - hmm.
Professor A: So, I mean, it doesn't take deep {disfmarker} {vocalsound} a new {disfmarker} bold new methods to get rid of uh five hertz noise, so.
PhD B: Yeah.
Professor A: um {vocalsound} uh But. So it was {disfmarker} it was a bad example in that way, but it's {disfmarker} it still is {disfmarker} it's the real thing that we did get out of the microphone at distance, so it wasn't {vocalsound} it w it w wasn't wrong it was inappropriate. So. {vocalsound} So uh, but uh, Yeah, someone noticed it later pointed it out to me, and I went"" oh, man. Why didn't I notice that?"" PhD B: Hmm.
Professor A: um. So. {vocalsound} um So I think we'll change our {disfmarker} our picture on the web, when we're @ @. One of the things I was {disfmarker} I mean, I was trying to think about what {disfmarker} what's the best {vocalsound} way to show the difference an and I had a couple of thoughts one was, {vocalsound} that spectrogram that we show {vocalsound} is O K, but the thing is {vocalsound} the eyes uh and the {vocalsound} the brain behind them are so good at picking out patterns {vocalsound} from {disfmarker} from noise {vocalsound} that in first glance you look at them it doesn't seem like it's that bad uh because there's many features that are still preserved. So one thing to do might be to just take a piece of the spec uh of the spectrogram where you can see {vocalsound} that something looks different, an and blow it up, and have that be the part that's {disfmarker} just to show as well. You know.
PhD B: Mm - hmm. Mm - hmm.
Professor A: i i Some things are going to be hurt. um {vocalsound} Another, I was thinking of was um {vocalsound} taking some spectral slices, like uh {disfmarker} like we look at with the recognizer, and look at the spectrum or cepstrum that you get out of there, and the {disfmarker} the uh, um, {vocalsound} the reverberation uh does make it {disfmarker} does change that. And so maybe {disfmarker} maybe that would be more obvious.
PhD B: Hmm.
Grad C: Spectral slices?
Professor A: Yeah.
Grad C: W w what d what do you mean?
Professor A: Well, I mean um all the recognizers look at frames. So they {disfmarker} they look at {disfmarker}
PhD B: So like one instant in time.
Professor A: Yeah, look at a {disfmarker}
Grad C: OK.
Professor A: So it's, yeah, at one point in time or uh twenty {disfmarker} over twenty milliseconds or something, {vocalsound} you have a spectrum or a cepstrum.
Grad C: OK.
Professor A: That's what I meant by a slice.
Grad C: I see.
Professor A: Yeah. And {vocalsound} if you look at {disfmarker}
PhD B: You could just {disfmarker} you could just throw up, you know, uh {vocalsound} the uh {disfmarker} some MFCC feature vectors. You know, one from one, one from the other, and then, you know, you can look and see how different the numbers are.
Professor A: Right. Well, that's why I saying either {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Well, either spectrum or cepstrum
PhD B: I'm just kidding.
Professor A: but {disfmarker} {vocalsound} but I think the thing is you wanna {disfmarker}
PhD B: I don't mean a graph. I mean the actual numbers.
Professor A: Oh. I see. Oh. That would be lovely, yeah.
PhD B: Yeah."" See how different these {vocalsound} sequences of numbers are?"" Professor A: Yeah. Or I could just add them up and get a different total.
PhD B: Yeah. It's not the square.
Professor A: OK. Uh. What else {disfmarker} wh what's {disfmarker} what else is going on?
PhD F: Uh, yeah. Yeah, at first I had a remark why {disfmarker} I am wondering why the PDA is always so far. I mean we are always meeting at the {vocalsound} beginning of the table and {vocalsound} the PDA's there.
Professor A: Uh. I guess cuz we haven't wanted to move it. We {disfmarker} we could {disfmarker} {vocalsound} we could move us,
PhD F: Yeah?
Professor A: and.
PhD F: OK.
Grad E: That's right.
PhD F: Well, anyway. Um. Yeah, so. Uh. Since the last meeting we've {disfmarker} we've tried to put together um {vocalsound} the clean low - pass um downsampling, upsampling, I mean, Uh the new filter that's replacing the LDA filters, and also {vocalsound} the um delay issue so that {disfmarker} We considered th the {disfmarker} the delay issue on the {disfmarker} for the on - line normalization. Mmm. So we've put together all this and then we have results that are not um {vocalsound} {vocalsound} very impressive. Well, there is no {vocalsound} real improvement.
Professor A: But it's not wer worse and it's better {disfmarker} better latency,
PhD F: It's not {disfmarker}
Professor A: right?
PhD F: Yeah. Yeah. Well. Actually it's better. It seems better when we look at the mismatched case but {vocalsound} I think we are like {disfmarker} like cheated here by the {disfmarker} th this problem that {vocalsound} uh in some cases when you modify slight {disfmarker} slightly modify the initial condition you end up {vocalsound} completely somewhere air somewhere else in the {disfmarker} in the space, {vocalsound} the parameters.
Professor A: Yeah.
PhD F: So. Well. The other system are for instance. For Italian is at seventy - eight {vocalsound} percent recognition rate on the mismatch, and this new system has eighty - nine. But I don't think it indicates something, really. I don't {disfmarker} I don't think it means that the new system is more robust
Professor A: Uh - huh.
PhD F: or {disfmarker} It's simply the fact that {disfmarker} Well.
Professor A: Well, the test would be if you then tried it on one of the other test sets, if {disfmarker} if it was {disfmarker}
PhD F: Y
Professor A: Right. So this was Italian, right?
PhD F: Yeah. Yeah.
Professor A: So then if you take your changes
PhD F: It's similar for other test sets
Professor A: and then {disfmarker}
PhD F: but I mean {vocalsound} from this se seventy - eight um percent recognition rate system, {vocalsound} I could change the transition probabilities for the {disfmarker} the first HMM and {pause} it will end up to eighty - nine also.
Professor A: Uh - huh.
PhD F: By using point five instead of point six, point four {vocalsound} as in the {disfmarker} the HTK script.
Professor A: Uh - huh. Yeah.
PhD F: So. Well. That's {disfmarker}
PhD B: Yeah. Yeah I looked at um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} looked at the results when Stephane did that
PhD F: Well. Eh uh {disfmarker}
PhD B: and it's {disfmarker} it's really wo really happens.
PhD F: This really happens.
PhD B: I mean th the only difference is you change the self - loop transition probability by a tenth of a percent
PhD F: Yeah.
Professor A: Yeah.
PhD B: and it causes ten percent difference in the word error rate.
Professor A: A tenth of a per cent.
PhD B: Yeah. From point {disfmarker}
PhD F: Even tenth of a percent?
PhD B: I {disfmarker} I'm sorry
PhD F: Well, we tried {disfmarker} we tried point one,
PhD B: f for point {disfmarker} from {disfmarker} You change at point one
PhD F: yeah.
Professor A: Oh!
PhD B: and n not tenth of a percent, one tenth,
PhD F: Hmm.
Professor A: Yeah.
PhD B: alright? Um so from point five {disfmarker} so from point six to point five and you get ten percent better.
Professor A: Mm - hmm.
PhD B: And it's {disfmarker} {vocalsound} I think it's what you basically hypothesized in the last meeting {vocalsound} about uh it just being very {disfmarker}
PhD F: Mm - hmm.
PhD B: and I think you mentioned this in your email too {disfmarker} it's just very um {disfmarker}
PhD F: Mmm, yeah.
PhD B: you know get stuck in some local minimum and this thing throws you out of it I guess.
PhD F: Mm - hmm.
Professor A: Well, what's {disfmarker} what are {disfmarker} according to the rules what {disfmarker} what are we supposed to do about the transition probabilities? Are they supposed to be point five or point six?
PhD B: I think you're not allowed to {disfmarker} Yeah. That's supposed to be point six, for the self - loop.
PhD F: Yeah.
Professor A: Point {disfmarker} It's supposed to be point six.
PhD B: Yeah. But changing it to point five I think is {disfmarker} which gives you much better results, but that's {vocalsound} not allowed.
Professor A: But not allowed? Yeah. OK.
PhD B: Yeah.
PhD F: Yeah, but even if you use point five, I'm not sure it will always give you the better results
PhD B: Yeah.
PhD F: on other test set or it
PhD B: Right. We only tested it on the {disfmarker} the medium mismatch,
PhD F: on the other training set, I mean.
PhD B: right? You said on the other cases you didn't notice {disfmarker}
PhD F: Yeah. But. I think, yeah. I think the reason is, yeah, I not I {disfmarker} it was in my mail I think also, {vocalsound} is the fact that the mismatch is trained only on the far microphone. Well, in {disfmarker} for the mismatched case everything is um using the far microphone training and testing, whereas for the highly mismatched, training is done on the close microphone so {vocalsound} it's {disfmarker} it's clean speech basically so you don't have this problem of local minima probably and for the well - match, it's a mix of close microphone and distant microphone and {disfmarker} Well.
PhD B: I did notice uh something {disfmarker}
PhD F: So th I think the mismatch is the more difficult for the training part.
PhD B: Somebody, I think it was Morgan, suggested at the last meeting that I actually count to see {vocalsound} how many parameters and how many frames.
Professor A: Mm - hmm.
PhD F: Mm - hmm.
PhD B: And there are uh almost one point eight million frames of training data and less than forty thousand parameters in the baseline system.
Professor A: Hmm.
PhD F: Yeah.
PhD B: So it's very, very few parameters compared to how much training data.
Professor A: Well. Yes.
PhD D: Mm - hmm.
Professor A: So. And that {disfmarker} that says that we could have lots more parameters actually.
PhD B: Yeah. Yeah.
PhD F: Mm - hmm.
PhD B: I did one quick experiment just to make sure I had everything worked out and I just {disfmarker} {vocalsound} uh f for most of the um {disfmarker} For {disfmarker} for all of the digit models, they end up at three mixtures per state. And so I just did a quick experiment, where I changed it so it went to four and um {vocalsound} it it {disfmarker} it didn't have a r any significant effect at the uh medium mismatch and high mismatch cases and it had {disfmarker} {vocalsound} it was just barely significant for the well - matched better. Uh so I'm r gonna run that again but {vocalsound} um with many more uh mixtures per state.
Professor A: Yeah. Cuz at forty thou I mean you could you could have uh {disfmarker} Yeah, easily four times as many {vocalsound} parameters.
PhD B: Mm - hmm. And I think also {vocalsound} just seeing what we saw {vocalsound} uh in terms of the expected duration of the silence model? when we did this tweaking of the self - loop? The silence model expected duration was really different.
PhD F: Yeah.
PhD B: And so in the case where {vocalsound} um {vocalsound} it had a better score, the silence model expected duration was much longer.
PhD F: Yeah.
PhD B: So it was like {disfmarker} {vocalsound} it was a better match. I think {vocalsound} you know if we make a better silence model I think that will help a lot too um for a lot of these cases so but one one thing I {disfmarker} I wanted to check out before I increased the um {vocalsound} number of mixtures per state was {vocalsound} uh {vocalsound} in their {vocalsound} default training script they do an initial set of three re - estimations and then they built the silence model and then they do seven iterations then the add mixtures and they do another seven then they add mixtures then they do a final set of seven and they quit. Seven seems like a lot to me and it also makes the experiments go take a really long time I mean to do one turn - around of the well matched case takes like a day.
Professor A: Mm - hmm. Mm - hmm.
PhD B: And so {vocalsound} you know in trying to run these experiments I notice, you know, it's difficult to find machines, you know, compute the run on. And so one of the things I did was I compiled HTK for the Linux {vocalsound} machines
Professor A: Mm - hmm.
PhD B: cuz we have this one from IBM that's got like five processors in it?
Professor A: Right.
PhD B: and so now I'm {disfmarker} you can run stuff on that and that really helps a lot because now we've got {vocalsound} you know, extra machines that we can use for compute. And if {disfmarker} I'm do running an experiment right now where I'm changing the number of iterations? {vocalsound} from seven to three?
PhD D: Mm - hmm.
Professor A: Yeah.
PhD B: just to see how it affects the baseline system. And so if we can get away with just doing three, we can do {vocalsound} many more experiments more quickly. And if it's not a {disfmarker} a huge difference from running with seven iterations, {vocalsound} um, you know, we should be able to get a lot more experiments done.
PhD F: Hmm.
PhD B: And so. I'll let you know what {disfmarker} what happens with that. But if we can {vocalsound} you know, run all of these back - ends f with many fewer iterations and {vocalsound} on Linux boxes we should be able to get a lot more experimenting done.
Professor A: Mm - hmm.
PhD B: So. So I wanted to experiment with cutting down the number of iterations before I {vocalsound} increased the number of Gaussians.
Professor A: Right. Sorry. So um, how's it going on the {disfmarker}
PhD F: Um.
Professor A: So. You {disfmarker} you did some things. They didn't improve things in a way that convinced you you'd substantially improved anything.
PhD F: Yeah.
Professor A: But they're not making things worse and we have reduced latency, right?
PhD F: Yeah. But actually {disfmarker} um actually it seems to do a little bit worse for the well - matched case and we just noticed that {disfmarker} Yeah, actually the way the final score is computed is quite funny. It's not a mean of word error rate. It's not a weighted mean of word error rate, it's a weighted mean of improvements.
Professor A: Uh - huh.
PhD F: So. Which means that {vocalsound} actually the weight on the well - matched is {disfmarker} Well I well what what {disfmarker} What happened is that if you have a small improvement or a small if on the well - matched case {vocalsound} it will have uh huge influence on the improvement compared to the reference because the reference system is {disfmarker} is {disfmarker} is quite good for {disfmarker} for the well - ma well - matched case also.
PhD B: So it {disfmarker} it weights the improvement on the well - matched case really heavily compared to the improvement on the other cases?
PhD F: No, but it's the weighting of the {disfmarker} of the improvement not of the error rate.
PhD B: Yeah. Yeah, and it's hard to improve on the {disfmarker} on the best case, cuz it's already so good, right?
PhD F: Yeah but {pause} what I mean is that you can have a huge improvement on the H {disfmarker} HMK's, uh like five percent uh absolute, and this will not affect the final score almost {disfmarker} Uh this will almost not affect the final score because {vocalsound} this improvement {disfmarker} because the improvement {vocalsound} uh relative to the {disfmarker} the baseline is small {disfmarker}
Professor A: So they do improvement in terms of uh accuracy? rather than word error rate?
PhD F: Uh. Uh improvement?
Professor A: So {disfmarker}
PhD F: No, it's compared to the word er it's improvement on the word error rate,
Professor A: OK.
PhD F: yeah. Sorry.
Professor A: So if you have uh ten percent error and you get five percent absolute uh {vocalsound} improvement then that's fifty percent.
PhD F: Mm - hmm.
Professor A: OK. So what you're saying then is that if it's something that has a small word error rate, {vocalsound} then uh a {disfmarker} even a relatively small improvement on it, in absolute terms, {vocalsound} will show up as quite {disfmarker} quite large in this.
PhD F: Mm - hmm.
Professor A: Is that what you're saying?
PhD F: Yeah.
Professor A: Yes.
PhD F: Yeah.
Professor A: OK. But yeah that's {disfmarker} that's {disfmarker} it's the notion of relative improvement. Word error rate.
PhD F: Yeah. Sure, but when we think about the weighting, which is point five, point three, point two, {vocalsound} it's on absolute on {disfmarker} on relative figures,
Professor A: Yeah.
PhD F: not {disfmarker}
Professor A: Yeah.
PhD F: So when we look at this error rate
Professor A: No. That's why I've been saying we should be looking at word error rate uh and {disfmarker} and not {disfmarker} not at {vocalsound} at accuracies.
PhD F: uh {disfmarker} Mmm, yeah. Mmm, yeah.
Professor A: It's {disfmarker}
PhD F: Mm - hmm.
Professor A: I mean uh we probably should have standardized on that all the way through. It's just {disfmarker}
PhD B: Well.
PhD F: Mm - hmm.
PhD B: I mean, it's not {disfmarker} it's not that different, right? I mean, just subtract the accuracy.
Professor A: Yeah but you're {disfmarker} but when you look at the numbers, your sense of the relative size of things is quite different.
PhD B: I mean {disfmarker} Oh. Oh, I see. Yeah.
Professor A: If you had ninety percent uh correct {vocalsound} and five percent, five over ninety doesn't look like it's a big difference, but {vocalsound} five over ten is {disfmarker} is big.
PhD B: Mm - hmm.
PhD F: Mm - hmm.
Professor A: So just when we were looking at a lot of numbers and {vocalsound} getting sense of what was important.
PhD B: I see. I see. Yeah. That makes sense.
Professor A: Um.
PhD F: Mmm.
Professor A: Um.
PhD F: Well anyway uh. So. Yeah. So it hurts a little bit on the well - match and yeah.
Professor A: What's a little bit? Like {disfmarker}
PhD F: Like, it's difficult to say because again um {vocalsound} {vocalsound} I'm not sure I have the um {disfmarker}
PhD B: Hey Morgan? Do you remember that Signif program that we used to use for testing signi? Is that still valid? I {disfmarker} I've been using that.
Professor A: Yeah. Yeah, it was actually updated.
PhD B: OK.
Professor A: Uh. {vocalsound} Jeff updated it some years ago
PhD B: Oh, it was. Oh, I shoul
Professor A: and {disfmarker} and uh cleaned it up made some things better in it. So.
PhD B: OK. I should find that new one. I just use my old one from {vocalsound} ninety - two or whatever
Professor A: Yeah, I'm sure it's not that different but {disfmarker} but he {disfmarker} {vocalsound} he uh {disfmarker} he was a little more rigorous, as I recall.
PhD B: OK.
PhD F: Right. So it's around, like, point five. No, point six {comment} uh percent absolute on Italian {disfmarker}
Professor A: Worse.
PhD F: Worse, yep.
Professor A: Out of what? I mean. s
PhD F: Uh well we start from ninety - four point sixty - four, and we go to ninety - four point O four.
Professor A: Uh - huh. So that's six {disfmarker} six point th
PhD F: Uh.
PhD B: Ninety - three point six four, right? is the baseline.
PhD F: Oh, no, I've ninety - four. Oh, the baseline, you mean.
PhD B: Yeah.
PhD F: Well I don't {disfmarker} I'm not talking about the baseline here.
PhD B: Oh. Oh. I'm sorry.
PhD F: I uh {disfmarker} My baseline is the submitted system.
PhD B: Ah! OK. Ah, ah.
PhD F: Hmm.
Professor A: Yeah.
PhD B: Sorry.
PhD F: Oh yeah. For Finnish, we start to ninety - three point eight - four and we go to ninety - three point seventy - four. And for Spanish we are {disfmarker} we were at ninety - five point O five and we go to ninety - three - s point sixty one.
Professor A: OK, so we are getting hurt somewhat.
PhD F: So.
Professor A: And is that wh what {disfmarker} do you know what piece {disfmarker} you've done several changes here. Uh, do you know what pie
PhD F: Yeah. I guess {disfmarker} I guess it's {disfmarker} it's the filter. Because nnn, well uh we don't have complete result, but the filter {disfmarker} So the filter with the shorter delay hurts on Italian well - matched, which {disfmarker} And, yeah. And the other things, like um {vocalsound} downsampling, upsampling, don't seem to hurt and {vocalsound} the new on - line normalization, neither.
PhD B: I'm {disfmarker}
PhD F: So.
PhD B: I'm really confused about something. If we saw that making a small change like, you know, a tenth, to the self - loop had a huge effect, {vocalsound} can we really make any conclusions about differences in this stuff?
PhD F: Mm - hmm. Yeah that's th Yeah.
PhD B: I mean, especially when they're this small. I mean.
PhD F: I think we can be completely fooled by this thing, but {disfmarker} I don't know.
Professor A: Well, yeah.
PhD F: So. There is first this thing, and then the {disfmarker} yeah, I computed the um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} like, the confidence level on the different test sets. And for the well - matched they are around um {vocalsound} point six uh percent. For the mismatched they are around like let's say one point five percent. And for the well - m uh HM they are also around one point five.
Professor A: But {disfmarker} OK, so you {disfmarker} these {disfmarker} these degradations you were talking about were on the well - matched case
PhD F: So.
Professor A: Uh. Do the {disfmarker} does the new filter make things uh better or worse for the other cases?
PhD F: Yeah. But. Uh. About the same. It doesn't hurt. Yeah.
Professor A: Doesn't hurt, but doesn't get a little better, or something.
PhD F: No.
Professor A: No. OK, so {vocalsound} um I guess the argument one might make is that,"" Yeah, if you looked at one of these cases {vocalsound} and you jiggle something and it changes {vocalsound} then uh you're not quite sure what to make of it. But when you look across a bunch of these and there's some {disfmarker} some pattern, um {disfmarker} I mean, so eh h here's all the {disfmarker} if {disfmarker} if in all these different cases {vocalsound} it never gets better, and there's significant number of cases where it gets worse, {vocalsound} then you're probably {pause} hurting things, {vocalsound} I would say. So um {vocalsound} I mean at the very least that would be a reasonably prediction of what would happen with {disfmarker} with a different test set, that you're not jiggling things with. So I guess the question is if you can do better than this. If you can {disfmarker} if we can approximate {vocalsound} the old numbers while still keeping the latency down.
PhD F: Mmm. Yeah.
Professor A: Uh, so. Um. What I was asking, though, is uh {disfmarker} are {disfmarker} what's {disfmarker} what's the level of communication with uh {vocalsound} the O G I gang now, about this and {disfmarker}
PhD F: Well, we are exchanging mail as soon as we {disfmarker} {vocalsound} we have significant results.
Professor A: Yeah.
PhD F: Um. Yeah. For the moment, they are working on integrating {vocalsound} the um {vocalsound} spectral subtraction apparently from Ericsson.
Professor A: Mm - hmm.
PhD F: Um. Yeah. And so. Yeah. We are working on our side on other things like {vocalsound} uh also trying a sup spectral subtraction but of {disfmarker} of our own, I mean, another {vocalsound} spectral substraction.
Professor A: Mm - hmm.
PhD F: Um. Yeah. So I think it's {disfmarker} it's OK. It's going {disfmarker}
Professor A: Is there any further discussion about this {disfmarker} this idea of {disfmarker} of having some sort of source code control?
PhD F: Yeah. Well. For the moment they're {disfmarker} uh everybody's quite um {disfmarker} There is this Eurospeech deadline, so.
Professor A: I see.
PhD F: Um. And. Yeah. But yeah. As soon as we have something that's significant and that's better than {disfmarker} than what was submitted, we will fix {disfmarker} fix the system and {disfmarker} But we've not discussed it {disfmarker} it {disfmarker} it {disfmarker} this yet, yeah.
Professor A: Yeah. Sounds like a great idea but {disfmarker} but I think that {disfmarker} that um {vocalsound} he's saying people are sort of scrambling for a Eurospeech deadline.
PhD F: Mmm.
Professor A: But that'll be uh, uh done in a week. So, maybe after {vocalsound} this next one.
PhD F: Yeah.
PhD B: Wow! Already a week! Man!
Professor A: Yeah.
PhD B: You're right. That's amazing.
Professor A: Yeah. Anybo - anybody in the {disfmarker} in this group do doing anything for Eurospeech?
PhD F: S
Professor A: Or, is that what {disfmarker} is that {disfmarker}
PhD F: Yeah we are {disfmarker} {vocalsound} We are trying to {disfmarker} to do something with the Meeting Recorder digits,
Professor A: Right.
PhD F: and {disfmarker} But yeah. Yeah. And the good thing is that {pause} there is this first deadline,
Professor A: Yeah.
PhD F: and, well, some people from OGI are working on a paper for this, but there is also the um {vocalsound} special session about th Aurora which is {disfmarker} {vocalsound} uh which has an extended deadline. So. The deadline is in May.
Professor A: For uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Oh, for Eurospeech?
PhD F: For th Yeah.
Professor A: Oh!
PhD F: So f only for the experiments on Aurora. So it {disfmarker} it's good,
Professor A: Oh, a special dispensation.
PhD F: yeah.
Professor A: That's great.
PhD B: Mm - hmm. Where is Eurospeech this year?
PhD F: It's in Denmark.
Professor A: Aalborg {disfmarker} Aalborg uh
PhD B: Oh.
Professor A: So the deadline {disfmarker} When's the deadline? When's the deadline?
PhD F: Hmm? I think it's the thirteenth of May.
Professor A: That's great! It's great. So we should definitely get something in for that.
PhD F: Yeah.
Professor A: But on meeting digits, maybe there's {disfmarker} Maybe.
PhD F: Yeah.
Professor A: Maybe.
PhD F: So it would be for the first deadline.
Professor A: Yeah.
PhD F: Nnn.
Professor A: Yeah. So, I mean, I {disfmarker} I think that you could certainly start looking at {disfmarker} at the issue uh but {disfmarker} but uh {vocalsound} I think it's probably, on s from what Stephane is saying, it's {disfmarker} it's unlikely to get sort of active participation from the two sides until after they've {disfmarker}
PhD B: Well I could at least {disfmarker} Well, I'm going to be out next week but I could {pause} try to look into like this uh CVS over the web. That seems to be a very popular {vocalsound} way of {pause} people distributing changes and {disfmarker} over, you know, multiple sites and things
Professor A: Mm - hmm.
PhD B: so maybe {vocalsound} if I can figure out how do that easily and then pass the information on to everybody so that it's {vocalsound} you know, as easy to do as possible and {disfmarker} and people don't {disfmarker} it won't interfere with {comment} their regular work, then maybe that would be good. And I think we could use it for other things around here too. So.
Professor A: Good.
Grad C: That's cool. And if you're interested in using CVS, I've set it up here,
PhD B: Oh great.
Grad C: so.
PhD B: OK.
Grad C: um j
PhD B: I used it a long time ago but it's been a while so maybe I can ask you some questions.
Grad C: Oh. So. I'll be away tomorrow and Monday but I'll be back on Tuesday or Wednesday.
PhD B: OK.
Professor A: Yeah. Dave, the other thing, actually, is {disfmarker} is this business about this wave form. Maybe you and I can talk a little bit at some point about {vocalsound} coming up with a better {vocalsound} uh demonstration of the effects of reverberation for our web page, cuz uh {vocalsound} {disfmarker} the uh {vocalsound} um I mean, actually the {disfmarker} the uh It made a good {disfmarker} good audio demonstration because when we could play that clip the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the really {vocalsound} obvious difference is that you can hear two voices and {disfmarker} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} in the second one and only hear {disfmarker}
PhD B: Maybe we could just {pause} like, talk into a cup.
Professor A: Yeah.
PhD B: Some good reverb.
Professor A: No, I mean, it sound {disfmarker} it sounds pretty reverberant, but I mean you can't {disfmarker} when you play it back in a room with a {disfmarker} you know a big room, {vocalsound} nobody can hear that difference really.
Grad C: Yeah.
Professor A: They hear that it's lower amplitude and they hear there's a second voice,
Grad C: Uh - huh.
Professor A: um {vocalsound} but uh that {disfmarker} actually that makes for a perfectly good demo because that's a real obvious thing, that you hear two voices.
PhD B: But not of reverberation.
Professor A: Yeah.
Grad C: A boom.
Professor A: Well that {disfmarker} that {disfmarker} that's OK. But for the {disfmarker} the visual, just, you know, I'd like to have uh {vocalsound} uh, you know, the spectrogram again,
Grad C: Yeah.
Professor A: because you're {disfmarker} you're {disfmarker} you're visual {vocalsound} uh abilities as a human being are so good {vocalsound} you can pick out {disfmarker} you know, you {disfmarker} you look at the good one, you look at the cru the screwed up one, and {disfmarker} and you can see the features in it without trying to @ @ {disfmarker}
PhD B: I noticed that in the pictures.
Professor A: yeah.
PhD B: I thought"" hey, you know th"" I {disfmarker} My initial thought was"" this is not too bad!"" Professor A: Right. But you have to {disfmarker} you know, if you look at it closely, you see"" well, here's a place where this one has a big formant {disfmarker} uh uh formant {disfmarker} maj major formants here are {disfmarker} {vocalsound} are moving quite a bit."" And then you look in the other one and they look practically flat.
PhD B: Mm - hmm.
Professor A: So I mean you could {disfmarker} that's why I was thinking, in a section like that, you could take a look {disfmarker} look at just that part of the spectrogram and you could say"" Oh yeah. This {disfmarker} this really distorted it quite a bit."" PhD B: Yeah. The main thing that struck me in looking at those two spectrograms was the difference in the high frequencies. It looked like {vocalsound} for the one that was farther away, you know, it really {disfmarker} everything was attenuated
Professor A: Right.
PhD B: and {disfmarker} I mean that was the main visual thing that I noticed.
Professor A: Right. But it's {disfmarker} it's uh {disfmarker} So. Yeah. So there are {disfmarker} clearly are spectral effects. Since you're getting all this indirect energy, then a lot of it does have {disfmarker} have uh {vocalsound} reduced high frequencies. But um the other thing is the temporal courses of things really are changed, and {disfmarker} {vocalsound} and uh we want to show that, in some obvious way. The reason I put the wave forms in there was because {vocalsound} uh they {disfmarker} they do look quite different. Uh. And so I thought"" Oh, this is good."" but I {disfmarker} {vocalsound} I just uh {disfmarker} After {disfmarker} after uh they were put in there I didn't really look at them anymore, cuz I just {disfmarker} they were different. So {vocalsound} I want something that has a {disfmarker} is a more interesting explanation for why they're different. Um.
Grad C: Oh. So maybe we can just substitute one of these wave forms and um {vocalsound} then do some kind of zoom in on the spectrogram on an interesting area.
Professor A: Something like that. Yeah.
Grad C: Uh - huh.
Professor A: The other thing that we had in there that I didn't like was that um {vocalsound} the most obvious characteristic of the difference uh when you listen to it is that there's a second voice, and the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the uh {vocalsound} cuts that we have there actually don't correspond to the full wave form. It's just the first {disfmarker} I think there was something where he was having some trouble getting so much in, or. I {disfmarker} I forget the reason behind it. But {vocalsound} it {disfmarker} it's um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} it's the first six seconds or something {vocalsound} of it and it's in {vocalsound} the seventh or eighth second or something where @ @ the second voice comes in. So we {disfmarker} we would like to actually see {vocalsound} the voice coming in, too, I think, since that's the most obvious thing {pause} when you listen to it.
Grad C: Mm - hmm.
Professor A: So. Um.
PhD F: Uh, yeah. Yeah. I brought some {disfmarker} I don't know if {disfmarker} {vocalsound} some {vocalsound} figures here. Well. I start {disfmarker} we started to work on spectral subtraction. And {vocalsound} um {vocalsound} the preliminary results were very bad.
Professor A: Uh - huh.
PhD F: So the thing that we did is just to add spectral subtraction before this, the Wall uh process, which contains LDA on - line normalization. And it hurts uh a lot.
Professor A: Uh - huh.
PhD F: And so we started to look at {disfmarker} at um things like this, which is, well, it's {disfmarker} Yeah. So you have the C - zero parameters for one uh Italian utterance.
PhD D: You can @ @.
PhD F: And I plotted this for two channels. Channel zero is the close mic microphone, and channel one is the distant microphone. And it's perfectly synchronized, so. And the sentence contain only one word, which is"" Due"" And it can't clearly be seen. Where {disfmarker} where is it?
Professor A: Uh - huh.
PhD F: Where is the word?
PhD B: This is {disfmarker} this is,
Grad E: Hmm.
PhD B: oh, a plot of C - zero,
PhD F: So.
PhD B: the energy.
PhD F: This is a plot of C - zero, uh when we don't use spectral substraction, and when there is no on - line normalization.
Professor A: Mm - hmm.
PhD F: So. There is just some filtering with the LDA and {vocalsound} and some downsampling, upsampling.
PhD B: C - zero is the close talking? {disfmarker}
PhD F: So.
PhD B: uh the close channel?
PhD F: Yeah. Yeah.
PhD B: and s channel one is the {disfmarker}
PhD F: Yeah. So C - zero is very clean, actually.
PhD B: Yeah.
PhD F: Uh then when we apply mean normalization it looks like the second figure, though it is not. Which is good. Well, the noise part is around zero
Professor A: Mm - hmm.
PhD F: and {disfmarker} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} And then the third figure is what happens when we apply mean normalization and variance normalization. So. What we can clearly see is that on the speech portion {vocalsound} the two channel come {disfmarker} becomes very close, but also what happens on the noisy portion is that the variance of the noise is {disfmarker}
Professor A: Mm - hmm.
PhD B: This is still being a plot of C - zero? OK.
PhD F: Yeah. This is still C - zero.
PhD B: Can I ask um what does variance normalization do? w What is the effect of that?
Professor A: Normalizes the variance.
PhD F: So it {disfmarker} it {disfmarker} Yeah.
PhD B: I mean
PhD F: It normalized th the standard deviation.
PhD B: y Yeah.
PhD F: So it {disfmarker}
PhD B: No, I understand that,
PhD F: You {disfmarker} you get an estimate of the standard deviation.
PhD B: but I mean {disfmarker}
PhD F: That's
PhD B: No.
PhD F: um {disfmarker}
PhD B: No, I understand what it is, but I mean, what does it {disfmarker} what's {disfmarker} what is
PhD F: Yeah but.
PhD B: uh {disfmarker}
Professor A: What's the rationale?
PhD B: We Yeah. Yeah. Why {disfmarker} why do it?
PhD F: Uh.
Professor A: Well, I mean, because {vocalsound} everything uh {disfmarker} If you have a system based on Gaussians, everything is based on means and variances.
PhD B: Yeah.
Professor A: So if there's an overall {vocalsound} reason {disfmarker} You know, it's like uh if you were doing uh image processing and in some of the pictures you were looking at, uh there was a lot of light uh and {disfmarker} and in some, there was low light,
PhD B: Mm - hmm.
Professor A: you know, you would want to adjust for that in order to compare things.
PhD B: Mm - hmm.
Professor A: And the variance is just sort of like the next moment, you know? So uh {vocalsound} what if um one set of pictures was taken uh so that throughout the course it was {disfmarker} went through daylight and night uh {vocalsound} um um ten times, another time it went thr I mean i is, you know, how {disfmarker} how much {disfmarker} {vocalsound} how much vari
PhD B: Oh, OK.
Professor A: Or no. I guess a better example would be {vocalsound} how much of the light was coming in from outside rather than artificial light. So if it was a lot {disfmarker} {vocalsound} if more was coming from outside, then there'd be the bigger effect of the {disfmarker} of the {disfmarker} of the change in the {disfmarker} So every mean {disfmarker} every {disfmarker} all {disfmarker} all of the {disfmarker} the parameters that you have, especially the variances, are going to be affected by the overall variance.
PhD B: Oh, OK. Uh - huh.
Professor A: And so, in principle, you {disfmarker} if you remove that source, then, you know, you can {disfmarker}
PhD B: I see. OK. So would {disfmarker} the major effect is {disfmarker} that you're gonna get is by normalizing the means,
Professor A: That's the first order but {disfmarker} thing,
PhD B: but it may help {disfmarker} First - order effects.
Professor A: but then the second order is {disfmarker} is the variances
PhD B: And it may help to do the variance. OK.
Professor A: because, again, if you {disfmarker} if you're trying to distinguish between E and B
PhD B: OK.
Professor A: if it just so happens that the E's {vocalsound} were a more {disfmarker} you know, were recorded when {disfmarker} when the energy was {disfmarker} was {disfmarker} was larger or something,
PhD B: Mm - hmm. Mm - hmm. Mm - hmm.
Professor A: or the variation in it was larger, {vocalsound} uh than with the B's, then this will be {disfmarker} give you some {disfmarker} some bias.
PhD B:
Professor A: So the {disfmarker} {vocalsound} it's removing these sources of variability in the data {vocalsound} that have nothing to do with the linguistic component.
PhD B: OK.
PhD F: Mmm.
PhD B: Gotcha. OK. Sorry to interrupt.
Professor A: But the {disfmarker} the uh {disfmarker} but let me as ask {disfmarker} ask you something.
PhD F: Yep. And it {disfmarker} and this {disfmarker}
Professor A: i is {disfmarker} if {disfmarker} If you have a good voice activity detector, isn't {disfmarker} isn't it gonna pull that out?
PhD F: Yeah. Sure. If they are good. Yeah. Well what it {disfmarker} it shows is that, yeah, perhaps a good voice activity detector is {disfmarker} is good before on - line normalization and that's what uh {vocalsound} we've already observed. But uh, yeah, voice activity detection is not {vocalsound} {vocalsound} an easy thing neither.
PhD B: But after you do this, after you do the variance normalization {disfmarker} I mean.
PhD F: Mm - hmm.
PhD B: I don't know, it seems like this would be a lot easier than this signal to work with.
PhD F: Yeah. So. What I notice is that, while I prefer to look at the second figure than at the third one, well, because you clearly see where speech is.
Professor A: Yeah.
PhD B: Yeah.
PhD F: But the problem is that on the speech portion, channel zero and channel one are more different than when you use variance normalization where channel zero and channel one become closer.
Professor A: Right.
PhD B: But for the purposes of finding the speech {disfmarker}
PhD F: And {disfmarker} Yeah, but here {disfmarker}
PhD B: You're more interested in the difference between the speech and the nonspeech,
PhD F: Yeah.
PhD B: right?
PhD F: Yeah. So I think, yeah. For I th I think that it {disfmarker} perhaps it shows that {vocalsound} uh the parameters that the voice activity detector should use {disfmarker} uh have to use should be different than the parameter that have to be used for speech recognition.
Professor A: Yeah. So basically you want to reduce this effect.
PhD F: Well, y
Professor A: So you can do that by doing the voi voice activity detection. You also could do it by spect uh spectral subtraction before the {vocalsound} variance normalization, right?
PhD F: Yeah, but it's not clear, yeah.
Professor A: So uh {disfmarker}
PhD F: We So. Well. It's just to
Professor A: Yeah.
PhD F: the {disfmarker} the number that at that are here are recognition experiments on Italian HM and MM {vocalsound} with these two kinds of parameters. And, {pause} well, it's better with variance normalization.
Professor A: Yeah. Yeah. So it does get better even though it looks ugly.
PhD F: Uh {disfmarker}
Professor A: OK. but does this have the voice activity detection in it?
PhD F: Yeah.
Professor A: OK.
PhD F: Um.
Professor A: So.
Grad E: OK.
PhD B: Where's th
PhD F: But the fact is that the voice activity detector doesn't work on channel one. So. Yeah.
Professor A: Uh - huh.
PhD B: Where {disfmarker} at what stage is the voice activity detector applied? Is it applied here or a after the variance normalization?
PhD F: Hmm?
Professor A: Spectral subtraction, I guess.
PhD B: or {disfmarker}
PhD F: It's applied before variance normalization. So it's a good thing,
PhD B: Oh.
PhD F: because I guess voice activity detection on this should {disfmarker} could be worse.
PhD B: Yeah. Is it applied all the way back here?
PhD F: It's applied the um on, yeah, something like this,
PhD B: Maybe that's why it doesn't work for channel one.
PhD F: yeah. Perhaps, yeah.
Professor A: Can I {disfmarker}
PhD F: So we could perhaps do just mean normalization before VAD.
PhD B: Mm - hmm.
Professor A: Mm - hmm. Can I ask a, I mean {disfmarker} a sort of top - level question, which is {vocalsound} um"" if {disfmarker} if most of what the OGI folk are working with is trying to {vocalsound} integrate this other {disfmarker} other uh spectral subtraction, {vocalsound} why are we worrying about it?"" PhD F: Mm - hmm. About? Spectral subtraction?
Professor A: Yeah.
PhD F: It's just uh {disfmarker} Well it's another {disfmarker} They are trying to u to use the um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} the Ericsson and we're trying to use something {disfmarker} something else. And. Yeah, and also to understand what happens because
Professor A: OK.
PhD F: uh fff Well. When we do spectral subtraction, actually, I think {vocalsound} that this is the {disfmarker} the two last figures.
Professor A: Yeah.
PhD F: Um. It seems that after spectral subtraction, speech is more emerging now uh {vocalsound} than {disfmarker} than before.
Professor A: Mm - hmm.
PhD B: Speech is more what?
PhD F: Well, the difference between the energy of the speech and the energy of the n spectral subtrac subtracted noise portion is {disfmarker} is larger.
Professor A: Mm - hmm.
PhD F: Well, if you compare the first figure to this one {disfmarker} Actually the scale is not the same, but if you look at the {disfmarker} the numbers um {vocalsound} you clearly see that the difference between the C - zero of the speech and C - zero of the noise portion is larger. Uh but what happens is that after spectral subtraction, {vocalsound} you also increase the variance of this {disfmarker} of C - zero.
Professor A: Mm - hmm.
PhD F: And so if you apply variance normalization on this, it completely sc screw everything. Well.
Professor A: Mm - hmm.
PhD F: Um. Uh. Yeah. So yeah. And what they did at OGI is just {vocalsound} uh they don't use on - line normalization, for the moment, on spectral subtraction and I think {disfmarker} Yeah. I think as soon as they will try on - line normalization {vocalsound} there will be a problem. So yeah, we're working on the same thing but {vocalsound} I think uh with different {disfmarker} different system and {disfmarker}
Professor A: Right. I mean, i the Intellectually it's interesting to work on things th uh one way or the other
PhD F: Mm - hmm.
Professor A: but I'm {disfmarker} I'm just wondering if um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} on the list of things that there are to do, if there are things that we won't do because {vocalsound} we've got two groups doing the same thing.
PhD F: Mm - hmm.
Professor A: Um. That's {disfmarker}
PhD F: Mm - hmm.
Professor A: Um. Just {disfmarker} just asking. Uh. I mean, it's {disfmarker}
PhD F: Yeah, well,
PhD B: There also could be {disfmarker} I mean. I can maybe see a reason f for both working on it too
PhD F: uh.
PhD B: if {vocalsound} um you know, if {disfmarker} if {disfmarker} if you work on something else and {disfmarker} and you're waiting for them to give you {vocalsound} spectral subtraction {disfmarker} I mean it's hard to know whether {vocalsound} the effects that you get from the other experiments you do will {vocalsound} carry over once you then bring in their spectral subtraction module. So it's {disfmarker} it's almost like everything's held up waiting for this {vocalsound} one thing. I don't know if that's true or not, but I could see how {disfmarker}
PhD F: Mmm.
Professor A: I don't know.
PhD B: Maybe that's what you were thinking.
Professor A: I don't know. {vocalsound} I mean, we still evidently have a latency reduction plan which {disfmarker} which isn't quite what you'd like it to be. That {disfmarker} that seems like one prominent thing. And then uh weren't issues of {disfmarker} of having a {disfmarker} a second stream or something? That was {disfmarker} Was it {disfmarker} There was this business that, you know, we {disfmarker} we could use up the full forty - eight hundred bits, and {disfmarker}
PhD F: Yeah. But I think they'I think we want to work on this. They also want to work on this, so. Uh. {vocalsound} yeah. We {disfmarker} we will try MSG, but um, yeah. And they are t I think they want to work on the second stream also, but more with {vocalsound} some kind of multi - band or, well, what they call TRAP or generalized TRAP.
Professor A: Mm - hmm.
PhD F: Um. So.
Professor A: OK. Do you remember when the next meeting is supposed to be? the next uh {disfmarker}
PhD F: It's uh in June.
Professor A: In June. OK.
PhD F: Yeah.
Professor A: Yeah. Um. Yeah, the other thing is that you saw that {disfmarker} that mail about uh the VAD {disfmarker} V A Ds performing quite differently? That that uh So um. This {disfmarker} there was this experiment of uh"" what if we just take the baseline?"" PhD F: Mmm.
Professor A: set uh of features, just mel cepstra, and you inc incorporate the different V A And it looks like the {disfmarker} the French VAD is actually uh better {disfmarker} significantly better.
PhD B: Improves the baseline?
Professor A: Yeah. Yeah.
PhD F: Yeah but I don't know which VAD they use. Uh. If the use the small VAD I th I think it's on {disfmarker} I think it's easy to do better because it doesn't work at all. So. I {disfmarker} I don't know which {disfmarker} which one. It's Pratibha that {disfmarker} that did this experiment.
PhD D: Yeah.
PhD F: Um. We should ask which VAD she used.
PhD D: I don't @ @. He {disfmarker} Actually, I think that he say with the good VAD of {disfmarker} from OGI and with the Alcatel VAD. And the experiment was sometime better, sometime worse.
PhD F: Yeah but I {disfmarker} it's uh {disfmarker} I think you were talking about the other mail that used VAD on the reference features.
Professor A: Yes.
PhD F: Yeah.
Professor A: And on that one, uh the French one is {disfmarker} was better.
PhD D: I don't remember.
Professor A: It was just better.
PhD D: Mm - hmm.
Professor A: I mean it was enough better that {disfmarker} that it would {vocalsound} uh account for a fair amount of the difference between our performance, actually.
PhD F: Mm - hmm.
PhD D: Mm - hmm.
Professor A: So. {vocalsound} Uh. So if they have a better one, we should use it. I mean. You know? it's {disfmarker} you can't work on everything.
PhD F: Yeah.
Professor A: Uh. {vocalsound} Uh. Yeah.
PhD F: Yeah, so we should find out if it's really better. I mean if it {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} compared to the small or the big network.
PhD D: Mm - hmm.
Professor A: Yeah.
PhD F: And perhaps we can easily improve if {disfmarker} if we put like mean normalization before the {disfmarker} before the VAD. Because {disfmarker} {vocalsound} as {disfmarker} as you've {pause} mentioned.
Professor A: Yeah.
PhD F: Mmm.
Professor A: H Hynek will be back in town uh the week after next, back {disfmarker} back in the country. So. And start {disfmarker} start organizing uh {vocalsound} more visits and connections and so forth,
PhD F: Mm - hmm.
Professor A: and {disfmarker} uh working towards June.
PhD F: Yeah.
PhD D: Also is Stephane was thinking that {vocalsound} maybe it was useful to f to think about uh {vocalsound} voiced - unvoiced {disfmarker}
PhD F: Mm - hmm.
PhD D: to work uh here in voiced - unvoiced detection.
PhD F: Yeah. Yeah.
PhD D: And we are looking {vocalsound} {vocalsound} in the uh signal.
PhD F: Yeah, my feeling is that um actually {vocalsound} when we look at all the proposals, ev everybody is still using some kind of spectral envelope
Professor A: Right.
PhD F: and um it's {disfmarker}
Professor A: No use of pitch uh basically. Yeah.
PhD F: Yeah, well, not pitch, but to look at the um fine {disfmarker} at the {disfmarker} at the high re high resolution spectrum.
Professor A: Yeah. Well, it {disfmarker}
PhD F: So. We don't necessarily want to find the {disfmarker} the pitch of the {disfmarker} of the sound but uh {disfmarker} Cuz I have a feeling that {vocalsound} when we look {disfmarker} when we look at the {disfmarker} just at the envelope there is no way you can tell if it's voiced and unvoiced, if there is some {disfmarker} It's {disfmarker} it's easy in clean speech because voiced sound are more low frequency and. So there would be more,
Professor A: Yeah.
PhD F: uh {disfmarker} there is the first formant, which is the larger and then voiced sound are more high frequencies cuz it's frication and {disfmarker}
Professor A: Right.
PhD F: But, yeah. When you have noise there is no um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} if {disfmarker} if you have a low frequency noise it could be taken for {disfmarker} for voiced speech and.
Professor A: Yeah, you can make these mistakes,
PhD F: So.
Professor A: but {disfmarker} but {disfmarker}
PhD B: Isn't there some other
PhD F: S
PhD B: uh d
PhD F: So I think that it {disfmarker} it would be good {disfmarker} Yeah, yeah, well, go {disfmarker} go on.
PhD B: Uh, I was just gonna say isn't there {disfmarker} {vocalsound} aren't {disfmarker} aren't there lots of ideas for doing voice activity, or speech - nonspeech rather, {comment} um by looking at {vocalsound} um, you know, uh {vocalsound} I guess harmonics or looking across time {disfmarker}
Professor A: Well, I think he was talking about the voiced - unvoiced, though,
PhD F: Mmm.
Professor A: right? So, not the speech - nonspeech.
PhD B: Yeah. Well even with e
Professor A: Yeah.
PhD B: uh w ah you know, uh even with the voiced - non {pause} voiced - unvoiced
PhD F: Mmm.
PhD B: um {disfmarker} I thought that you or {pause} somebody was talking about {disfmarker}
Professor A: Well. Uh yeah. B We should let him finish what he w he was gonna say,
PhD F: So.
PhD B: OK.
Professor A: and {disfmarker}
PhD B: So go ahead.
PhD F: Um yeah, so yeah, I think if we try to develop a second stream well, there would be one stream that is the envelope and the second, it could be interesting to have that's {disfmarker} something that's more related to the fine structure of the spectrum. And. Yeah, so I don't know. We were thinking about like using ideas from {disfmarker} from Larry Saul, have a good voice detector, have a good, well, voiced - speech detector, that's working on {disfmarker} on the FFT and {vocalsound} uh
Professor A: U
PhD F: Larry Saul could be an idea. We were are thinking about just {vocalsound} kind of uh taking the spectrum and computing the variance of {disfmarker} of the high resolution spectrum {vocalsound} and things like this.
Professor A: So u s u OK. So {disfmarker} So many {vocalsound} tell you something about that. Uh we had a guy here some years ago who did some work on {vocalsound} um {vocalsound} making use of voicing information uh to {vocalsound} help in reducing the noise.
PhD F: Yeah?
Professor A: So what he was doing is basically y you {disfmarker} {vocalsound} you do estimate the pitch.
PhD F: Mm - hmm.
Professor A: And um you {disfmarker} from that you {disfmarker} you estimate {disfmarker} or you estimate fine harmonic structure, whichev ei either way, it's more or less the same. But {vocalsound} uh the thing is that um you then {vocalsound} can get rid of things that are not {disfmarker} i if there is strong harmonic structure, {vocalsound} you can throw away stuff that's {disfmarker} that's non - harmonic.
PhD F: Mm - hmm. Mm - hmm.
Professor A: And that {disfmarker} that is another way of getting rid of part of the noise
PhD F: Yeah.
Professor A: So um that's something {vocalsound} that is sort of finer,
PhD F: Yeah.
Professor A: brings in a little more information than just spectral subtraction. Um.
PhD F: Mm - hmm.
Professor A: And he had some {disfmarker} I mean, he did that sort of in combination with RASTA. It was kind of like RASTA was taking care of convolutional stuff
PhD F: Mmm.
Professor A: and he was {disfmarker}
PhD F: Mm - hmm.
Professor A: and {disfmarker} and got some {disfmarker} some decent results doing that. So that {disfmarker} that's another {disfmarker} another way. But yeah, there's {disfmarker} there's {disfmarker}
PhD F: Yeah. Mmm.
Professor A: Right. There's all these cues. We've actually back when Chuck was here we did some voiced - unvoiced uh {vocalsound} classification using a bunch of these,
PhD F: But {disfmarker}
Professor A: and {disfmarker} and uh works OK. Obviously it's not perfect but um {disfmarker}
PhD F: Mm - hmm.
Professor A: But the thing is that you can't {disfmarker} given the constraints of this task, we can't, {vocalsound} in a very nice way, feed {pause} forward to the recognizer the information {disfmarker} the probabilistic information that you might get about whether it's voiced or unvoiced, where w we can't you know affect the {disfmarker} {vocalsound} the uh distributions or anything.
PhD F: Mm - hmm.
Professor A: But we {disfmarker} what we uh {disfmarker} I guess we could Yeah.
PhD B: Didn't the head dude send around that message? Yeah, I think you sent us all a copy of the message, where he was saying that {disfmarker} I I'm not sure, exactly, what the gist of what he was saying, but something having to do with the voice {vocalsound} activity detector and that it will {disfmarker} {vocalsound} that people shouldn't put their own in or something. It was gonna be a {disfmarker}
Professor A: That {disfmarker} But {disfmarker} OK. So that's voice activity detector as opposed to voicing detector.
PhD F: They didn't.
Professor A: So we're talking about something a little different.
PhD F: Mmm.
PhD B: Oh, I'm sorry.
Professor A: Right?
PhD B: I {disfmarker} I missed that.
PhD F: Mmm.
Professor A: I guess what you could do, maybe this would be w useful, if {disfmarker} if you have {disfmarker} if you view the second stream, yeah, before you {disfmarker} before you do KLT's and so forth, if you do view it as probabilities, and if it's an independent {disfmarker} So, if it's {disfmarker} if it's uh not so much {vocalsound} envelope - based by fine - structure - based, uh looking at harmonicity or something like that, um if you get a probability from that information and then multiply it by {disfmarker} you know, multiply by all the voiced {vocalsound} outputs and all the unvoiced outputs, you know, then {vocalsound} use that as the
PhD F: Mm - hmm.
Professor A: uh {disfmarker} take the log of that or {vocalsound} uh pre pre uh {disfmarker} pre - nonlinearity,
PhD F: Yeah. i if {disfmarker}
Professor A: uh and do the KLT on the {disfmarker} on {disfmarker} on that,
PhD F: Yeah.
Professor A: then that would {disfmarker} that would I guess be uh a reasonable use of independent information. So maybe that's what you meant. And then that would be {disfmarker}
PhD F: Yeah, well, I was not thinking this {disfmarker} yeah, this could be an yeah So you mean have some kind of probability for the v the voicing
Professor A: R Right. So you have a second neural net.
PhD F: and then use a tandem system
Professor A: It could be pretty small. Yeah. If you have a tandem system and then you have some kind of {disfmarker} it can be pretty small {disfmarker} net {disfmarker}
PhD F: Mm - hmm.
Professor A: we used {disfmarker} we d did some of this stuff. Uh I {disfmarker} I did, some years ago,
PhD F: Yeah.
Professor A: and the {disfmarker} and {disfmarker} and you use {disfmarker} {vocalsound} the thing is to use information primarily that's different as you say, it's more fine - structure - based than {disfmarker} than envelope - based
PhD F: Mm - hmm.
Professor A: uh so then it you {disfmarker} you {disfmarker} you can pretty much guarantee it's stuff that you're not looking at very well with the other one, and uh then you only use for this one distinction.
PhD F: Alright.
Professor A: And {disfmarker} and so now you've got a probability of the cases, and you've got uh the probability of the finer uh categories on the other side. You multiply them where appropriate and uh {vocalsound} um
PhD F: I see, yeah. Mm - hmm.
Professor A: if they really are from independent {pause} information sources then {vocalsound} they should have different kinds of errors
PhD F: Mm - hmm.
Professor A: and roughly independent errors, and {vocalsound} it's a good choice for {disfmarker}
PhD F: Mm - hmm. Mm - hmm. Yeah.
Professor A: Uh. Yeah, that's a good idea.
PhD F: Yeah. Because, yeah, well, spectral subtraction is good and we could u we could use the fine structure to {disfmarker} to have a better estimate of the noise but {vocalsound} still there is this issue with spectral subtraction that it seems to increase the variance of {disfmarker} of {disfmarker} of
Professor A: Yeah.
PhD F: um Well it's this musical noise which is annoying if you d you do some kind of on - line normalization after.
Professor A: Right.
PhD F: So. Um. Yeah. Well. Spectral subtraction and on - line normalization don't seem to {disfmarker} to go together very well. I
Professor A: Or if you do a spectral subtraction {disfmarker} do some spectral subtraction first and then do some on - line normalization then do some more spectral subtraction {disfmarker} I mean, maybe {disfmarker} maybe you can do it layers or something so it doesn't {disfmarker} doesn't hurt too much or something.
PhD F: Ah, yeah.
Professor A: But it {disfmarker} but uh, anyway I think I was sort of arguing against myself there by giving that example
PhD F: Yeah.
Professor A: uh I mean cuz I was already sort of {vocalsound} suggesting that we should be careful about not spending too much time on exactly what they're doing In fact if you get {disfmarker} if you go into uh {disfmarker} a uh harmonics - related thing {vocalsound} it's definitely going to be different than what they're doing and uh uh
PhD F: Mm - hmm.
Professor A: should have some interesting properties in noise. Um. {vocalsound} I know that when have people have done {pause} um sort of the obvious thing of taking {vocalsound} uh your feature vector and adding {pause} in some variables which are {vocalsound} pitch related or uh that {disfmarker} it hasn't {disfmarker} my impression it hasn't particularly helped. Uh. Has not.
PhD F: It {disfmarker} it i has not,
Professor A: Yeah.
PhD F: yeah.
Professor A: But I think uh {pause} that's {disfmarker} that's a question for this uh you know extending the feature vector versus having different streams.
PhD F: Oh. Was it nois noisy condition? the example that you {disfmarker} you just
Professor A: And {disfmarker} and it may not have been noisy conditions.
PhD F: Yeah.
Professor A: Yeah. I {disfmarker} I don't remember the example but it was {disfmarker} {vocalsound} it was on some DARPA data and some years ago and so it probably wasn't, actually
PhD F: Mm - hmm. Mm - hmm. Yeah. But we were thinking, we discussed with Barry about this, and {vocalsound} perhaps {vocalsound} thinking {disfmarker} we were thinking about some kind of sheet cheating experiment where we would use TIMIT
Professor A: Uh - huh.
PhD F: and see if giving the d uh, this voicing bit would help in {disfmarker} in terms of uh frame classification.
Professor A: Why don't you {disfmarker} why don't you just do it with Aurora?
PhD F: Mmm.
Professor A: Just any i in {disfmarker} in each {disfmarker} in each frame
PhD F: Yeah, but {disfmarker} but {disfmarker} B but we cannot do the cheating, this cheating thing.
Grad E: We're {disfmarker}
Professor A: uh {disfmarker}
Grad E: We need labels.
Professor A: Why not?
PhD F: Well. Cuz we don't have {disfmarker} Well, for Italian perhaps we have, but we don't have this labeling for Aurora. We just have a labeling with word models
Professor A: I see.
PhD F: but not for phonemes.
PhD D: Not for foreigners.
Grad E: we don't have frame {disfmarker} frame level transcriptions.
Professor A: Um.
PhD D: Right.
PhD F: Um. {vocalsound} Yeah.
Professor A: But you could {disfmarker} I mean you can {disfmarker} you can align so that {disfmarker} It's not perfect, but if you {disfmarker} if you know what was said and {disfmarker}
PhD B: But the problem is that their models are all word level models. So there's no phone models {pause} that you get alignments for.
PhD F: Mm - hmm.
Professor A: Oh.
PhD B: You {disfmarker} So you could find out where the word boundaries are but that's about it.
Professor A: Yeah. I see.
Grad E: S But we could use uh the {disfmarker} the noisy version that TIMIT, which {vocalsound} you know, is similar to the {disfmarker} the noises found in the TI - digits {vocalsound} um portion of Aurora.
PhD F: Yeah. noise, yeah. Yeah, that's right, yep. Mmm.
Professor A: Yeah.
PhD F: Well, I guess {disfmarker} I guess we can {disfmarker} we can say that it will help, but I don't know. If this voicing bit doesn't help, uh, I think we don't have to {disfmarker} to work more about this because {disfmarker}
Professor A: Uh.
PhD F: Uh. It's just to know if it {disfmarker} how much i it will help
Professor A: Yeah.
PhD F: and to have an idea of how much we can gain.
Professor A: Right. I mean in experiments that we did a long time ago
PhD F: Mmm.
Professor A: and different ta it was probably Resource Management or something, um, I think you were getting {pause} something like still eight or nine percent error on the voicing, as I recall. And um, so um
Grad E: Another person's voice.
Professor A: what that said is that, sort of, left to its own devices, like without the {disfmarker} a strong language model and so forth, that you would {disfmarker} {vocalsound} you would make significant number of errors {vocalsound} just with your uh probabilistic machinery in deciding
PhD B: It also {disfmarker}
Professor A: one oh
PhD B: Yeah, the {disfmarker} though I think uh there was one problem with that in that, you know, we used canonical mapping so {vocalsound} our truth may not have really been {pause} true to the acoustics.
Professor A: Uh - huh.
Grad E: Hmm.
PhD B: So.
PhD F: Mmm.
Professor A: Yeah. Well back twenty years ago when I did this voiced - unvoiced stuff, we were getting more like {vocalsound} ninety - seven or ninety - eight percent correct in voicing. But that was {vocalsound} speaker - dependent {vocalsound} actually. We were doing training {vocalsound} on a particular announcer
PhD F: Mm - hmm.
Professor A: and {disfmarker} and getting a {vocalsound} very good handle on the features.
PhD F: Mm - hmm.
Professor A: And we did this complex feature selection thing where we looked at all the different possible features one could have for voicing and {disfmarker} {vocalsound} and {disfmarker} and uh {disfmarker} and exhaustively searched {vocalsound} all size subsets and {disfmarker} and uh {disfmarker} for {disfmarker} for that particular speaker and you'd find you know the five or six features which really did well on them.
PhD B: Wow!
PhD F: Mm - hmm.
Professor A: And then doing {disfmarker} doing all of that we could get down to two or three percent error. But that, again, was speaker - dependent with {vocalsound} lots of feature selection
PhD F: Mm - hmm.
Professor A: and a very complex sort of thing.
PhD F: Mmm.
Professor A: So I would {disfmarker} I would believe {vocalsound} that uh it was quite likely that um looking at envelope only, that we'd be {vocalsound} significantly worse than that.
PhD F: Mm - hmm.
Professor A: Uh.
PhD F: And the {disfmarker} all the {disfmarker} the SpeechCorders? what's the idea behind? Cuz they {disfmarker} they have to {disfmarker} Oh, they don't even have to detect voiced spe speech?
Professor A: The modern ones don't do a {disfmarker} {vocalsound} a simple switch.
PhD F: They just work on the code book
Professor A: They work on the code book excitation.
PhD F: and find out the best excitation.
Professor A: Yeah they do {vocalsound} analysis - by - synthesis. They try {disfmarker} they {disfmarker} they try every {disfmarker} every possible excitation they have in their code book and find the one that matches best.
PhD F: Yeah. Mmm. Alright. Yeah. So it would not help.
Professor A: Yeah.
Grad E: Hmm.
Professor A: Uh. O K.
PhD B: Can I just mention one other interesting thing?
Professor A: Yeah.
PhD B: Um. One of the ideas that we {pause} had come up with last week for things to try to {vocalsound} improve the system {disfmarker} Um. Actually I {disfmarker} I s we didn't {disfmarker} I guess I wrote this in after the meeting b but {vocalsound} the thought I had was um looking at the language model that's used in the HTK recognizer, which is basically just a big {vocalsound} loop,
Grad E: Mm - hmm.
PhD B: right? So you {disfmarker} it goes"" digit"" PhD D: Mm - hmm.
PhD B: and then that can be {disfmarker} either go to silence or go to another digit, which {disfmarker} That model would allow for the production of {vocalsound} infinitely long sequences of digits, right?
Professor A: Right.
PhD B: So. I thought"" well I'm gonna just look at the {disfmarker} what actual digit strings do occur in the training data."" Professor A: Right.
PhD B: And the interesting thing was it turns out that there are no sequences of two - long or three - long digit strings {pause} in any of the Aurora training data. So it's either one, four, five, six, uh up to eleven, and then it skips and then there's some at sixteen.
Professor A: But what about the testing data?
PhD B: Um. I don't know. I didn't look at the test data yet.
Professor A: Yeah. I mean if there's some testing data that has {disfmarker} has {disfmarker} {vocalsound} has two or three {disfmarker}
PhD B: So. Yeah. But I just thought that was a little odd, that there were no two or three long {disfmarker} Sorry. So I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} just for the heck of it, I made a little grammar which um, you know, had it's separate path {pause} for each length digit string you could get. So there was a one - long path and there was a four - long and a five - long
Professor A: Mm - hmm.
PhD B: and I tried that and it got way worse. There were lots of deletions.
Professor A: Mm - hmm.
PhD B: So it was {disfmarker} {vocalsound} you know, I {disfmarker} I didn't have any weights of these paths or {disfmarker} I didn't have anything like that.
Professor A: Mm - hmm.
PhD B: And I played with tweaking the {vocalsound} word transition penalties a bunch, but I couldn't go anywhere.
Professor A: Hmm.
PhD B: But um. I thought"" well if I only allow {disfmarker}"" Yeah, I guess I should have looked at {disfmarker} to see how often there was a mistake where a two - long or a three - long path was actually put out as a hypothesis. Um. But.
Professor A: Hmm.
PhD B: So to do that right you'd probably want to have {disfmarker} {vocalsound} allow for them all but then have weightings and things. So. I just thought that was a interesting {vocalsound} thing about the data.
Professor A: OK. So we're gonna read some more digit strings I guess?
PhD B: Yeah. You want to go ahead, Morgan?
Professor A: Sure.","The meeting began with the professor discussing the technical features of their recordings. The interaction between the hardware and the model had to be mediated through different techniques. Some members on the team were working on low-pass down-sampling as a replacement for LDA filters. Low-pass seemed to perform better, but the team was uncertain about its robustness. The professor thought that the team should submit something to Eurospeech and that they should further study reverberation. The professor thought that studying spectrograms would be a good place to start. The team then discussed VAD and line mean normalization as techniques for getting rid of noise. The meeting ended with a brief discussion on feature detection.",qmsum
"Summarize the whole meeting.
Project Manager: Okay. Everybody ready?
Marketing: Okay.
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
Project Manager: Uh I think the first thing we do is introduce ourselves
Marketing: I think so.
Project Manager: and everybody's name and what your function is?
Marketing: Yeah, that's a good plan.
Project Manager: So maybe we start with you?
User Interface: Okay. Yeah, my name is Francina. And I'm uh an user interface {disfmarker} my role is uh {disfmarker} the main responsibility is user interface.
Project Manager: Mm-hmm.
User Interface: And my role is to design uh a television remote control.
Project Manager: Mm-hmm. Okay.
Marketing: And I'm a marketing person. I wanna figure out how to sell them.
Project Manager: Mm-hmm. And your name is?
Marketing: My name is Eileen.
Project Manager: Okay.
Industrial Designer: Yeah. Uh I'm Jeanne-Oui. Um uh my role is industrial designer and my responsibilities are uh uh um deal with the {vocalsound} technical-functional designs and specifications of user interface and dealing with user interface design.
Project Manager: Very good. And as you already know I am Betty. I am the project manager for today. So why don't we look at the presentation {vocalsound} to see what we really are supposed to do. {vocalsound} Um.
Marketing: Okay.
Project Manager: {vocalsound} Yes y opening, acquaintance, tool training {disfmarker} well, the tools are, I think, we already {disfmarker} I guess the tool is really our {disfmarker} the computer, as far as I can see.
Marketing: Mm-hmm.
Project Manager: Uh we get ins each of us will get instructions and we'll take it from there. Project plan, that falls under the same heading pretty much. Um, I don't think we have any great discussion at this point.
Marketing: No.
Project Manager: Um. Here is what this thing should be. This thing we are gonna um uh design is a new remote control. Uh should be original {vocalsound}, trendy, and, of course, user friendly.
Marketing: Mm-hmm. {vocalsound} {vocalsound}
Project Manager: So maybe you wanna make some notes of that.
Marketing: Okay.
Project Manager: Okay?
Marketing: Mm-hmm.
Project Manager: All right. {vocalsound} Here is what the functional design is supposed to achieve. Um. That is it's gonna be individual work and then at the meeting we'll discuss what uh we have come up with. The same goes for the conceptual design, there will be individual work whic and then discussion afterwards. Detailed design, same thing basically.
Marketing: Mm'kay so {disfmarker} Three different types of design that we're gonna be concerned with okay.
Project Manager: Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.
Marketing: Functional, conception and detailed.
Project Manager: I can't write with this thing. {vocalsound}
Marketing: {vocalsound} Maybe we should redesign it. {vocalsound}
Project Manager: {vocalsound} Yes. {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Marketing: After we've finished the remote control we'll get to that.
Project Manager: {vocalsound} Yeah, okay. All right? Then, tool training try out the white board, participant can draw their favourite animal. Does anybody want to go and see how the white board works? So that in case we have to, in the next meeting, present something on the white board. You wanna go Eileen and {disfmarker}
Marketing: Okay, I'll see what I can do.
Project Manager: Whether you {disfmarker} without hanging yourself. {vocalsound}
Marketing: See if I r See if I remember how to draw a kitty cat or a rabbit or something. {vocalsound}
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: And remember you have to press so it works.
Marketing: So that it will record okay.
Project Manager: Mm-hmm.
Marketing: Um uh um traditional kitty cat.
Project Manager: {vocalsound} Fat, a fat cat. {vocalsound}
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Marketing: {vocalsound} I've a very fat cat.
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} {vocalsound}
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Marketing: {vocalsound} And it likes to sit like that.
Project Manager: Okay.
Marketing: Okay.
Project Manager: And you're Francine, right? Would you like s like just to see um how it feels, so that you have a little idea?
User Interface: Yes, I'm Francina. Yes, sure. {vocalsound}
Project Manager: In {disfmarker}
Marketing: Am I supposed to wipe off that or {disfmarker}
Project Manager: No, no. No, that's okay.
User Interface: No, Okay.
Marketing: okay.
Project Manager: I don't know, we'll get to that later.
Marketing: Okay.
User Interface: What should I draw? {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Snake.
User Interface: I'm going to draw a snake. {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: {vocalsound} Okay.
User Interface: How does it look like? {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Marketing: Uh, okay.
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: {vocalsound} Okay.
Marketing: I hope the kitty cat is hungry'cause I don't like snakes. {vocalsound}
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Here's the project finance uh which, of course, we all have to think about when we design this thing. Um selling price is supposed to be twenty five Euro. Uh profit aim for the company is fifty million Euro,
Marketing: Mm-hmm. {vocalsound}
Project Manager: the market range unlimited meaning international
Marketing: Okay.
Project Manager: and the production cost should not exceed {disfmarker} hopefully should be less than twelve fifty Euro.
Marketing: Mm'kay that should keep everybody on their toes and challenged.
Project Manager: Mm-hmm.
Marketing: Profit. Um is fifty mm.
Project Manager: So these are all things, of course, to remember with the budget and when you design {vocalsound} to materials, cost, etcetera. Now, uh the discussion I guess is um does anyone of you have experience with remote control?
Marketing: Oops.
Project Manager: I exp I s'cause we we use'em {disfmarker} we use'em, right, everyday.
Industrial Designer: Yeah, of course, using remote control. Yeah.
User Interface: Yes.
Project Manager: And um now having used a remote control for years does anybody already have like an idea like things you didn't like with it, things you would like to change, things you would like to improve with this thing ye any first ideas? Would you like it to be smaller, bigger,
Industrial Designer: Uh.
Project Manager: have more have more buttons on it or maybe clearly {disfmarker} better marked buttons, you know, things like that?
User Interface: Yeah, I {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
User Interface: Yes, I I feel that all the remote should be very compact.
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
Project Manager: Small, right. Mm-hmm.
User Interface: Yeah, those which we get here nowadays it's very long.
Project Manager: Mm-hmm.
User Interface: And um and it should have multi-purpose. Like uh the remote control which we use for T_V_, it shou uh it should be used f uh for some other purpose also, like controlling the uh temperature inside the house or for air-conditioners, or for heating system.
Project Manager: Mm-hmm.
Industrial Designer: Audio player. Oh. Okay.
Project Manager: So it should be a multi-functional uh gadget that would um control all your household uh uh machines basically.
User Interface: Yes, exactly Yes.
Industrial Designer: Hmm.
User Interface: Yes.
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} Divides us {disfmarker}
User Interface: Yeah. Exactly.
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} Yeah. Yeah.
Marketing: {vocalsound} At um twelve fifty Euros per {disfmarker} {vocalsound}
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Well.
Marketing: Well who knows if we get a really good designer maybe we can do that.
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
Marketing: {vocalsound} We certainly can try to {disfmarker} I agree with her that to market something successfully it should do some more things.
Project Manager: It should be something new {disfmarker} it should be s it it should do something different than than just what we have.
Marketing: That's right.
Project Manager: Now, of course, the other thing to think there is maybe the design.
User Interface: Yeah.
Industrial Designer: Yeah, of course.
User Interface: Yeah, design should be, yeah {disfmarker} it should be different. All the {disfmarker} almost all the remotes {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Like trendy no like f for earlier we saw maybe it should be something trendy you know. Maybe it should {disfmarker} different colours or materials or you know.
User Interface: Yes, exactly.
Industrial Designer: Yeah, maybe ten {disfmarker} I do yeah, colours
User Interface: Are different shapes.
Industrial Designer: and al shapes also. Yeah.
User Interface: Yes.
Project Manager: Um so yeah shapes right, you know, like kidney shape feels better in your hand or something, you know.
User Interface: Yes.
Industrial Designer: Yeah of course yeah.
Marketing: Yeah okay, friendly shape, that would help.
Project Manager: Yeah.
Marketing: I think another thing that would help is um if it beeps when you clap,
Project Manager: Yes.
Marketing: because I think one of the big things that happens is people lose them. They can't find it.
Project Manager: {vocalsound} That is true,
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: because they put a newspaper or they put it behind a plant or, we you know, whatever.
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: Yeah. {vocalsound}
Project Manager: And and they {disfmarker} suddenly the phone rings and they want to turn the T_V_ off and they say, where the hell is my {vocalsound} my remote control yeah?
Marketing: Mm-hmm.
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Well or yeah or if it's really, if it's really in a dark spot that it gives out a a sound or a signal.
Marketing: So some {disfmarker} {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: Yeah, some beep or something like that,
Project Manager: Yeah. Mm-hmm.
User Interface: Or a b
Marketing: Uh so, so it's really the beep or, or a light should blink.
Industrial Designer: so that we can go {disfmarker}
Project Manager: So if lost {disfmarker} If lost uh signal with b throw signal, you know.
User Interface: Should ha
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
User Interface: A fluorescent signal, yeah.
Marketing: Mm'kay.
Industrial Designer: Yeah, maybe it should have a light so that we can, we can just recognise where it is.
Project Manager: Exactly, I mean just {vocalsound} that's what I'm saying.
Industrial Designer: Yeah, yeah. May not be beep.
Project Manager: I'm just saying throw signal meaning just whether it's a beep or whether a light or {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Beep or uh it's a light, maybe it's a light.
Marketing: And do you think a good c c um clue for that is that it would respond to a clap or it would respond to your voice or it would respond {disfmarker} what what should you have to do to make it beep or blink?
Project Manager: Okay, my {disfmarker} my idea is maybe that the minute it's really hidden, in in other words if it's like in a dark spot, uh meaning you know like a newspaper is on top, a sweater is on top or it it's behind a plant, at that moment it's it's like, it's like um, what you call it {disfmarker} a light s sensors, you know?
Marketing: Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.
Project Manager: In in that moment it has a sensor, i it it gets a certain darkness, it ge has a sensor and it gives out a signal whether that be a light signal or a beep,
Marketing: Okay so {disfmarker}
User Interface: Yes.
Marketing: Okay.
Project Manager: I mean, that we can discuss that later, you know.
Industrial Designer: Yeah, probably {disfmarker} yeah, probably it's a {disfmarker} yeah, yeah.
User Interface: Yeah. And uh {disfmarker}
Marketing: So the light sensor would activate the signal.
Project Manager: That's right. You know there would be {vocalsound} {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Mm-hmm.
Project Manager: right you have to have some kind of sensor and I I think uh voice or clapping it's not specific enough. Uh I know there are the lamps and stuff, you know, you can clap on and off,
Marketing: Mm-hmm.
User Interface: Yes.
Project Manager: but I think they only work to certain degree and {disfmarker}
Marketing: But it could be someplace really obvious and you still wouldn't be able to find it.
Project Manager: What with {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Yeah, of course, that didn't {disfmarker}
User Interface: Then, in that case {disfmarker}
Marketing: Well, because you're s because you're silly. Because people are silly.
Industrial Designer: I i we can't do it.
Project Manager: Oh yeah well, but then those people {disfmarker} we can't help everybody. {vocalsound}
Marketing: I mean it could be on {disfmarker} well, i if it were like on top of your bookcase and you usually kept it on the coffee table
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Marketing: um {vocalsound},
Project Manager: Okay we have uh {disfmarker}
Marketing: you know, well {disfmarker} maybe we have to move along, okay.
Project Manager: yeah, we have to move along, but I think we have some good good points to start with here.
Industrial Designer: Yeah, good point.
Project Manager: Okay, the next meeting will be in thirty minutes. I think you all {disfmarker} did you get uh notices on your computer for this? Okay so well, you got the notice um
Industrial Designer: Me yeah.
User Interface: Yes.
Project Manager: {disfmarker} uh. The working design, I guess that's the function I_D_ {disfmarker} uh who is this? The industrial designer {disfmarker} That's you.
Industrial Designer: Yeah. Yeah, it's functional de yeah, exactly, technical.
Project Manager: Okay. So, we looking for a working design when we come back.
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: Uh working design, yeah, it's it's uh mainly technical-functional design.
Project Manager: Then {disfmarker} And then the technical funct you are the technical function,
Industrial Designer: Yeah, functional design,
Project Manager: so so you are the working design.
Industrial Designer: and you {disfmarker}
Project Manager: So you have a working design and then a functional design.
User Interface: Okay.
Project Manager: And the marketing manager is coming up with some user requirement specification, like friendliness, and what we just discussed in general. That would be your idea. And, of course, price. That it, that it, that the price is a good price. I mean, the price is given, but, that was {disfmarker}
Marketing: Mm-hmm. We have to justify that price by having sufficient features to make it sell at that price.
Project Manager: That's right. That's right.
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: And, you know, specifi you you will get specific um instructions for that. I think that's the end of the show. Yeah. So um {vocalsound} we have {disfmarker} well, we have a twen two two two three minutes. Um any questions at this point? Or uh suggestions?
Marketing: Mm.
Project Manager: I think {disfmarker} basically basically you will get instructions to work with and if you have any questions uh, uh I guess, you can uh {disfmarker}
User Interface: Okay.
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
Marketing: Okay, I think I have enough to think about'til our next meeting.
Project Manager: Mm-hmm.
Industrial Designer: Yeah, even I have.
Marketing: How about you people?
Project Manager: Mm-hmm.
User Interface: Yes.
Industrial Designer: Yeah, even I have, I think, yeah.
Marketing: Really? Okay.'Kay.
Project Manager: Okay.
Industrial Designer: Yeah, so let's see.
Marketing: Alright, well uh {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Then uh we see you in about thirty minutes. And see what we can come up with.
User Interface: Yes.
Industrial Designer: Hmm.
User Interface: Okay.
Marketing: Okay, very good.
Project Manager: Okay?
User Interface: Yes.
Industrial Designer: Yeah.","The meeting kicked off with self-introductions, familiarizing team members and their responsibilities. After stating the scope of the project, which was to design a new remote control, the team tested out the functions of the white board. Then, the team brainstormed about what features they would add to the new remote control, such as being multi-functional and having a light sensor, with the selling price of twenty five euros and production cost of twelve fifty Euros.",qmsum
"Summarize the group discussion about video demand, teletext demand, and thick keys design.
User Interface: Okay.
Project Manager: So I see all everybody's here,'kay.
Marketing: Mm-hmm.
Industrial Designer: Yep.
Project Manager: And we can start meeting.
User Interface: Okay {vocalsound}.
Marketing: What's the agenda for this meeting?
Project Manager: The {disfmarker} I will uh present here agenda with with with with slides to you.
Marketing: Okay.
Project Manager: Um as you can see here.
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: Perfect.
Project Manager: So first uh just to mention I will take notes uh of this meeting
Marketing: Mm-hmm.
Project Manager: and uh I will try to work them out and give them to you. I've also made notes of the previous meeting and um I was about to send them you but {vocalsound} then uh I had to go to this uh meeting so you will get them too uh
Marketing: Mm-hmm.
User Interface: Next.
Project Manager: Um.
Industrial Designer: So y you are the secretary also.
Project Manager: Yes. Indeed.
Industrial Designer: Right? Okay.
Project Manager: Then I hope you all have uh worked out {vocalsound} some some uh {vocalsound} some some presentations about uh about well you the the task given to you in the previous meeting.
Industrial Designer: Perfectly yeah yeah of course uh-huh.
User Interface: {gap}
Project Manager: Um. W We will uh in a minute we will uh {vocalsound} start with them. Um, we will see in which order we will handle them of. Um then I will uh bring in some some some new requirements I I got uh from the uh account manager, I try to work them out, they were quite abstract, and we can have maybe have com some discussion about it. Uh Um about the functions
Marketing: Mm-hmm.
Project Manager: and {disfmarker} Well in this meeting we should really {vocalsound} try to reach a decision about the target group and the functionality of the {disfmarker}
Marketing: Mm.
Industrial Designer: You mean the social target group who we wants to target?
Project Manager: Yes I mean well yes w who are we going to uh to well to sell this,
Marketing: Mm.
User Interface: {gap}
Industrial Designer: Oh the customers, okay.
Marketing: Yeah.
Project Manager: the customers, indeed yes. Think that's that's important matter.
Marketing: That's the big question yeah.
Project Manager: Uh. {vocalsound} So {vocalsound} And then uh we will close this meeting uh
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: and after this meeting we'll uh we'll have a lunch. Good. Um. Maybe um why uh Anna can you c do you have a presentations?
Marketing: No, I don't.
Project Manager: You don't have presentation?
Marketing: I wasn't. No.
Project Manager: Uh you want a table to to uh
Marketing: I c I can talk about it but I have no slides or anything.
Project Manager: Yes yes maybe maybe you can uh can just talk about it or maybe you can use the whiteboard if necessary um.
Marketing: Mm-hmm. Well I've just been um presented with some research we've done in a small focus group so, a hundred people, just asked them about their remote control usage habits and what they want in a remote control. Um. It's {disfmarker} probably can't email this to you, I've just got a web page with some data on it. Um basically it's saying that users generally dislike the look and feel of their remote controls. Um seventy five u seventy five percent of users find most remote controls ugly. Um.
Project Manager: Mm-hmm.
Marketing: Eighty percent of users would spend more money when a remote control would look fancy. Um. Current remote controls do not match well the operating behaviour of the user. Uh seventy five percent of users said they zap a lot, so they use their remote control quite frequently while they're watching television. Uh. Fifty percent of users say that they only use ten percent of the buttons, so they've got a remote control with a lot of functionality but really most of the time they only use a small part of that.
Project Manager: Mm.
Marketing: Um.
Project Manager: Do you Do you have this uh information on the web page you said?
Marketing: I have an a web page yes.
Project Manager: Yes, mayb maybe you can can send an email to me later uh. Uh about this.
Marketing: Yep. Yep, sure. Mm-hmm. So basically um there's a breakdown of how much they use the different functions on a rem remote control. Um, power and volume selection are only used a few times within this uh per hour. Um, channel selection is used a hundred and sixty eight times um {vocalsound} and then there's things like channel settings, audio settings, which are only used very infrequently.
Project Manager: Mm.
Marketing: Um. Teletext is used um fourteen times in the hour, so it is used but not nearly as much as the channel selection is used. Um.
Project Manager: Mm.
Marketing: An interesting thing that this report has brought up is that um fifty fifty percent of users report that the remote control gets lost a lot of the time in the room, so some way of some way of locating the remote control would be very useful to a lot of users. Um.
Project Manager: Yes yes, I have {vocalsound} that too {vocalsound}.
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Marketing: Thirty four percent said it takes too long to learn to use a remote control, they want something that's easier to use straight away, more intuitive perhaps.
Project Manager: Mm.
Marketing: Um.
Industrial Designer: It's it's easy to learn or how do you say it's {disfmarker}
Marketing: Thirty four percent said it took too much time to learn to use a new one. Yep.
Industrial Designer: Okay too much time to learn. Okay.
Marketing: Um. And thirty {disfmarker} twenty six percent said remote controls are bad for R_S_I_.
Industrial Designer: Not enough {gap}
Marketing: I don't know how we'd go about combating that.
User Interface: {gap}. What do you mean there?
Marketing: For R_S_I_? Respet Repetitive strain injury.
User Interface: Okay.
Marketing: So. But {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Mm. They think that or do their doctor the doctor says?
Marketing: Mm.
Project Manager: {vocalsound} But it's it's the opinion of the uh of the users huh?
Marketing: Yeah. That's what the report says yeah.
Project Manager: So mm.
Marketing: Um and then it's got a demographic breakdown on {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Maybe y y you cannot put this webpage online on the {disfmarker}
Marketing: Uh I should be able to actually, if I email it to you now.
User Interface: You can disconnect it there
Project Manager: {vocalsound} You can maybe just just {disfmarker}
User Interface: no?
Marketing: Oh no, yeah.
Industrial Designer: Ah it's {vocalsound} it okay it's a webpage on the C_ it's a file
Marketing: Yeah.
Industrial Designer: okay.
Marketing: Um, s hang on.
Industrial Designer: O otherwise you yeah. You can connect this one.
Project Manager: {gap}
User Interface: Then you can connect this one or this one yeah.
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
User Interface: All to your computer.
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
Marketing: Well.
Industrial Designer: So these are important numbers that Matthew and I need to take into account for our functional um {disfmarker}
User Interface: Oh yeah.
Project Manager: {gap}
Marketing: Oh I need to muck around with this. It's probably easier if you put it on yours and then I'll just email it to you. It's just a web link.
Project Manager: Hmm.
Industrial Designer: Yeah {gap}
User Interface: Okay.
Industrial Designer: Yeah these numbers have have to be have to be taken into account for the uh both yeah user interface and functional design.
User Interface: Hmm. {vocalsound} Yeah.
Marketing: One thing it goes on to talk about, which is interesting, is the {disfmarker} hang on a minute.
Industrial Designer: Because if there are many numbers and we need to select to to constraint uh our design based on what is more important.
Marketing: Mm-hmm. Yep.
Project Manager: Mm-hmm.
Marketing: Um, one thing is interesting is talking about um speech recognition in a remote control.
Industrial Designer: Speech recognition in {disfmarker}
Marketing: And who would pay more for that and whether people would find it useful.
Project Manager: D do you have numbers o o on that?
Industrial Designer: Ah okay.
Marketing: Yes, I'll just get this up.
Industrial Designer: So that we don't {disfmarker} Do we not need any button on the remote control {vocalsound}
Marketing: Well potentially yeah, um {disfmarker}
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: it would be all based on speech.
Marketing: I think even for interesti
Industrial Designer: Okay. Interesting idea.
Marketing: yeah I think that would not work so well. You wanna have both options.
Industrial Designer: Okay.
Project Manager: Well it would it would be a solution for uh when your remote control is lost,
Marketing: Mm-hmm.
Project Manager: I mean when it has speech recognition then uh i then it doesn't matter where it is, my {disfmarker} well it's {disfmarker} we should be in range,
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
Marketing: Mm.
Project Manager: or maybe it can respond and produce sound, so say where it is. But the these are all quite fancy features
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
Project Manager: I'm not sure whether we will we can make this for {vocalsound} for twelve Euro fi and fifty cents {vocalsound}.
User Interface: Well it would be f
Marketing: Yeah.
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
User Interface: No you can't.
Industrial Designer: And we don't know where the state of the art of speech recognition is, maybe you know?
User Interface: Oh. Well, {vocalsound} it depends you know like there is uh it's a very small vocabulary that you want to do the operations like you want to say on, off, one, two, twenty three,
Project Manager: Mm.
Industrial Designer: But it's quite noisy if there is the T_V_ uh shouting.
Marketing: Mm.
User Interface: yeah.
Marketing: Yeah.
Project Manager: Yes,
User Interface: It's it's going to be li
Project Manager: that that that that's mm.
User Interface: it's not going to be s so easy but u usually it's going to be more of an isolated case
Project Manager: Do you have some more important facts
User Interface: but it's {disfmarker} but I don't know with twenty fi
Marketing: Um {disfmarker}
Project Manager: or can we go to the next presentation?
Industrial Designer: Okay. So
Marketing: Well {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: you had to to to summarise maybe the {disfmarker}
Marketing: This is now talking about um who would pay for speech recognition in a remote control, who would pay more for it, um. Ninety percent of the fifteen to twenty five year old market said that they would pay more, it goes down from there, seventy six percent for twenty five to thirty five, thirty five percent for thirty five to forty five, um twenty two percent for forty five to fifty five and then eight percent for fifty five to sixty five.
Project Manager: Mm.
User Interface: Okay it's uh decline.
Marketing: Yeah.
User Interface: Okay.
Marketing: But we sh
Project Manager: Mm-hmm. Decline with age, mm.
Marketing: Yeah, it really depends where we're gonna be targeting this product, um,
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Mm. {vocalsound}
Marketing: which we'll be talking about later I think.
Industrial Designer: Mm.
Project Manager: Yes. We will talk about it later. {vocalsound}
Marketing: Did you get the email?
Project Manager: Okay. {vocalsound}
Marketing: Yep, that one.
Industrial Designer: Mm-hmm.
Marketing: Just follow that link.
Industrial Designer: {gap} I thi {vocalsound} You us
Marketing: It'll be in a different window, yep.
Industrial Designer: yeah yeah.
Marketing: That's {disfmarker} left {disfmarker} that one.
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
Marketing: Yep.
Industrial Designer: Okay perfect. . . .
Marketing: Mm. So that's the figure that I was just talking about there, with the different demographics.
User Interface: Okay.
Marketing: Another thing it's talking about there is the L_C_D_ screen but there's no figures apparently on that.
Project Manager: Mm. Okay. {vocalsound} um
Industrial Designer: Mm'kay.
Project Manager: Uh maybe uh Mael c c can you give uh uh your presentation uh?
Industrial Designer: Yeah. Mm I okay
Project Manager: Oh,
Industrial Designer: I stay {disfmarker}
Project Manager: this is {disfmarker}
User Interface: Now you can move I think yeah.
Project Manager: Mm-hmm, y y you can move, uh.
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} I can move as far as {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Maybe I take your chair?
Project Manager: Yes. You can you can sa take my chair.
Industrial Designer: I okay {vocalsound}.
User Interface: It's a channel selection, a module {gap}, this and this function,
Marketing: Sorry? Oh.
User Interface: go to the {gap}. Yeah.
Industrial Designer: So I think as everybody knows uh I'm the uh Industrial Designer. And uh in this presentation uh this group presentation um {vocalsound} is gonna focus on the working design of the the remote control. Um I'd like first to give a quick a very simple introduction, how does it work, so that everybody knows even if you don't have a very uh technical background uh what is it because I think in the product it is important.
Marketing: Mm. {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: So basically um the basic function of a remote control is to send uh messages to another system that is fixed.
Marketing: Mm-hmm.
Industrial Designer: And so an energy source feeds an integrated circuit, the chip, that can compose messages, usually uh through a um infrared bit
Marketing: Mm-hmm.
Industrial Designer: and uh the user interface controls the chip and accordingly the the messages, alright. So my method for um designing the yeah the work design uh yeah first {vocalsound} the the main point is that I would wish to to make a really functional product. I would prefer to have very functional um capabilities rather than fancy stuff that in fact is not used and doesn't work.
Marketing: Mm-hmm.
Project Manager: Mm.
Industrial Designer: So for that yeah as it's important to take into account the user requirements from the Marketing uh Expert uh Anna
Marketing: Mm-hmm.
Industrial Designer: and um w to to we should agree on what are the technical functions uh for this remote control and I show you the the working design. So um basically uh here is a really large view of what we want {vocalsound}. Uh we want an on off button, it can be uh {disfmarker} it's simple but it's it's important, and also uh {gap} the to both channels as well as other buttons that come after,
Marketing: Mm.
Industrial Designer: right. So the components I quickly draw here, is that in this part you have the remote control the the sender and on the other part the receiver so that's {disfmarker} my method is um will be to well my aim would be to uh design the and choose the chips and the infrared um components to build the remote control
Marketing: Mm-hmm.
Industrial Designer: right.
Project Manager: Mm-hmm.
Industrial Designer: So of course we need energy sources and uh uh the receiver a a receiver. This is {vocalsound} very quick uh design, uh you stop me or interrupt me if uh you don't agree on it on that.
Project Manager: Mm-hmm.
Industrial Designer: And um so what I have found and {vocalsound} after a lot of work actually I {vocalsound} I draw this I draw for you this uh schema
Marketing: {vocalsound} Well. {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Uh-huh.
Industrial Designer: that can be maybe too technical for you but is very important for me
Marketing: You drew it a long time ago?
Industrial Designer: you know.
Project Manager: Is huh
Marketing: Ninety one. {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} And uh that's it so I won't go into details about that
Project Manager: overwhelming {vocalsound}.
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: No.
Industrial Designer: but uh these are my preferences to use uh that kind of components.
Project Manager: {vocalsound} And and why do you want these kind of component?
Industrial Designer: So. So
Project Manager: I mean, are they cheap, or are they uh reliable? What were your {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: found and yeah th you have always a compromise with uh reliability and uh i if it's expensive,
Project Manager: Mm.
Industrial Designer: but uh this one was not this one also really uh reliable um so yeah that's it for the working design, uh I hope you get clearer view on uh what what a remote control is uh in terms of uh technical components
Project Manager: Yes. It it it's more clear now I think.
Industrial Designer: but maybe yeah {disfmarker}
Project Manager: So {vocalsound} {disfmarker}
User Interface: But is it uh can you just buy it on the market and f plug it in or you want to ma
Industrial Designer: No no no no we we will uh {disfmarker} This is a preference but we can always change uh {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Mm-hmm. What I w what I was thinking about uh the the the schema uh about uh the sender and the receiver, I mean can you can you get back to it?
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
Project Manager: {vocalsound} Yeah uh, the receiver is of course already in the television and we are not uh able to change it. So we we must adapt to the to the receiver.
Industrial Designer: Of course yeah.
Project Manager: I I suppose there is a standard uh way of communicating to televisions uh.
Industrial Designer: Yeah. We will use uh {vocalsound} infrared protocol uh using {vocalsound} yeah infrared and uh and of course we need to adapt to that protocol that already exists
Project Manager: Mm-hmm.
Industrial Designer: and but we what we can do is uh uh adapting {vocalsound} the the chips inside uh to the best uh chips and uh infrared bubbles.
Project Manager: Mm. Mm. Mm. Mm. Yes. Okay.
Industrial Designer: Um. Okay. {gap}
Project Manager: Thank you.
User Interface: Well it to du it's just you had to change the frequencies.
Industrial Designer: The frequencies?
User Interface: Yeah.
Industrial Designer: Yeah yeah. Of course yeah
User Interface: {vocalsound} But you should be careful,
Industrial Designer: in the chip you have it yeah.
User Interface: people are sometime becoming problem, like a guy has recently designed a remote uh uh uh which could switch off any other T_V_s {vocalsound}, so basically {gap} through all the things.
Industrial Designer: That can control o other things. Yeah.
Marketing: Ah.
Project Manager: Mm.
User Interface: So maybe we should think of {vocalsound}
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: Of course yeah we should take that into account
Marketing: That's handy.
Project Manager: Yeah yes
Marketing: So if the b T_V_ in the next apartment's really loud, you can just turn it off.
Project Manager: I I I {disfmarker}
User Interface: yeah.
Industrial Designer: in the uh {disfmarker}
User Interface: {vocalsound} Yeah so you can just go on the street and then switch off everyone's T_V_ {vocalsound} and you can just walk away {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
User Interface: You don't have to be near the T_V_ at all {vocalsound}.
Marketing: Yeah. I like that idea.
Project Manager: I I feel I I I think M Mael will will consider this uh th these things.
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Maybe Maybe we can go to to your presentation uh Matthew.
User Interface: Yeah
Project Manager: I I I assume you were finished here.
User Interface: so {vocalsound}.
Industrial Designer: Yes.
Project Manager: Uh okay.
User Interface: Okay. {vocalsound} So I can take I think mine now there.
Industrial Designer: Okay.
User Interface: Okay so voila.
Marketing: {vocalsound}
User Interface: Hmm I can take mine it's okay, voila, mm so mm. Okay.
Project Manager: Oh. I {disfmarker} Uh, sorry? I know where it is.
User Interface: It's on the desktop.
Project Manager: It's uh {disfmarker}
User Interface: Technical function.
Project Manager: Yes.
User Interface: Okay.
Project Manager: It's uh {disfmarker}
User Interface: Like so.
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
User Interface: Well. So um I'm going to talk a little bit about the technical function so wha what actually it's about what is the user going to do, I think my last presented what is going inside,
Marketing: Mm-hmm. Yep.
User Interface: so what's the user is going to see from the outside and how he is going to use it. So well the approach is that uh basically the idea is to send a message to the T_V_ set, as Mael has pointed, and it will be decoded by the T_V_ and usually we it is easier to have uh keys or buttons with which people can uh press and then um changing a button will basically uh change the message which is being sent to the T_V_ and uh {vocalsound} um
Industrial Designer: Mm-hmm.
User Interface: a and basically it sends an internal signal and decoded by the receiver. So p as um Anna has said that this ki people are interested in things which are you don't need to k press the keys, people are can have a speech recognition but this is uh s a question which will we have to see later.
Project Manager: Mm-hmm.
User Interface: But in the present scenario is that you have certain keys and you press it like your mobile phone, and it sends a message to the T_V_.
Project Manager: Mm.
Industrial Designer: Yep.
User Interface: {vocalsound} And um so generally mm I don't have some figures sorry but um so there are two kinds of uh remote if you popularly in the household, actually so you have a standard T_V_ remote where you have just a on, off button and play, uh volume change and uh keys for the number and more than one digit option. And if you see for example righ right now uh uh even the one uh on more than one digit option is for two digit channel which is like ninety nine, but {vocalsound} tomorrow you might have one fifty channels you know to browse or two hundred channels to browse who knows, but uh uh. Then there is uh {vocalsound} this is the standard one with without any fancy thing you know like i it doesn't have teletext option, it can without any, it's a very simple thing, um which which you can vouch {vocalsound}. And then you have uh what's the v video remote file which is like usually it has almost all the keys over there and, but it then it has other options like stop uh and then you play the movie or uh or fo fast forward the movie or something like that so i it has those
Marketing: Mm-hmm.
User Interface: so these are the standard uh commonly found remote controls in the uh market. And then {disfmarker} whi which is generally used by the people. And then {vocalsound} well personal preferences I would {disfmarker} uh basically think of having a kind of aim for the next generation thing where the {disfmarker} we could have both the uh the f a T_V_ and the remote {disfmarker} video remote control because uh some of the keys in the video's remote control and the T_V_ they could be integrated together so that uh we could um aim for the like in the f coming future um that type of uh applications with {disfmarker}
Marketing: Okay. How would that work? So you've got say maybe a V_C_R_ and a T_V_ which are separate,
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Marketing: so you {disfmarker} on my one at home I've got a V_C_R_ remote which then changes the channel on the V_C_R_ and doesn't do anything on the T_V_,
User Interface: Yeah.
Marketing: so is it gonna be like a switch on the remote that says t use the T_V_ or use the V_C_R_?
User Interface: Yeah.
Marketing: or does it know which one you want to use?
User Interface: Um actually um you could you could think of um having s a y you can have a key which could tell y it could go to the video thing
Marketing: Mm-hmm.
User Interface: but um uh yo you you you still can't um in that case when it you use that the function should be able to take up the V_C_R_ option
Marketing: Mm-hmm.
User Interface: and you could play it or {disfmarker} You can also think about having like um {vocalsound} {disfmarker} I in a few days you will be ha in in few ye coming years you might even have a system where you have a separate uh sitting setup box
Marketing: Mm-hmm.
User Interface: and uh you have uh um something like uh uh you do you do you suppose you are not able to watch some programme and actually it downloading all the time for you
Marketing: Mm-hmm. Mm.
User Interface: and uh you can just you know uh when you come back you could just switch on that thing and uh watch a program.
Marketing: Mm.
User Interface: In that case you want to browse faster, browse slow, you want to have those kind of functionalities {vocalsound}.
Marketing: Mm.
Project Manager: Mm mm mm mm mm.
Marketing: Mm.
Industrial Designer: These are kind of next generation {vocalsound} functionalities.
User Interface: It's the next generation thing,
Project Manager: Mm yes,
User Interface: but it is going to come in couple of years.
Marketing: Mm.
Project Manager: but I think it's i i it's already there,
User Interface: It's goi
Project Manager: I mean the hard disk uh recorders uh I I've seen them in the shop.
User Interface: Yeah it's {disfmarker}
Marketing: Mm.
User Interface: Yeah.
Marketing: Yeah.
User Interface: Yeah. So
Industrial Designer: Mm'kay.
User Interface: it's going to record your things and you and you you need basically the functionalities what you need in both uh uh video as well as in the standard T_V_ thing.
Marketing: Mm. Yeah. That's fair enough. Mm. But I don't think we're trying to make a universal remote here. That's,
User Interface: No no we are not making a universal remote,
Marketing: yeah.
User Interface: we are just looking at uh giving a scenario, I have a T_V_ and tomorrow I am going to have set up box
Marketing: Mm.
User Interface: which is going to sit there and uh it's going to do that job for me.
Marketing: Mm. Because y
Project Manager: W w w w we need to decide on on on on in how far we go to in this.
Marketing: Mm-hmm. Mm.
Project Manager: Mean, you can go {vocalsound} pretty far I f I think with with with functions and possible uh future p uh prospects
Marketing: Mm. Yep.
Project Manager: yes.
User Interface: Yeah. So {vocalsound}
Project Manager: But it's good to keep in mind.
Marketing: Mm.
User Interface: Okay so that p ends my presentation.
Project Manager: Mm. Very well.
User Interface: Well. So we can always discuss about it for example uh the presently the video market actually uh this demand, video over-demand or what we call it as, it's presently {vocalsound} booming up actually
Industrial Designer: Mm-hmm.
Marketing: Mm. Yeah.
User Interface: so it i like people are providing like uh things like uh uh movies, you can select actually so you want to watch a movie and uh your p your provider gives a list of movies, and then you select those list.
Marketing: Mm-hmm.
User Interface: And it
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
User Interface: basically you go off, it downloads the movie, it gives for you
Marketing: Mm.
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
User Interface: and then when you come you want to loo watch it on your T_V_.
Project Manager: Good.
User Interface: And thi this is going to come.
Industrial Designer: Or even you don't need to download it, it's streamed uh online uh yeah. Yeah.
User Interface: Yeah it can be streamed online for you and you can say what time I want to watch the movie
Marketing: Mm.
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
User Interface: and {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
User Interface: Yeah
Project Manager: Um, so u um
User Interface: so. Yeah.
Project Manager: I have uh received some some some some well points of of thinking over of my account manager and uh I would like to share them with you. Um
Marketing: Mm-hmm.
Industrial Designer: Mm-hmm.
Project Manager: first thing is uh teletext is a well known feature of televisions
Marketing: Mm-hmm.
Project Manager: but it's it's getting used less and less.
User Interface: {vocalsound} Yeah.
Project Manager: That's that's especially because of the internet of course.
Marketing: Hmm.
Project Manager: So we should think about it um. Do we include it, and do we give it a prominent uh prominent uh place on on on the on well huh on the remote mot control itself.
Marketing: Mm.
Project Manager: Uh as uh a in any case it's it's not used, well very much, but it's it is still used. Um
Marketing: Mm.
User Interface: Um.
Project Manager: further yes we must think, uh do we stay uh to to television only, the television as we as we all know it with with broadcasting signals and you can't go back uh huh, or do we uh uh go further as Matthew indicated by supporting uh uh recording uh devices?
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Marketing: So D_V_D_s and V_C_R_s?
Project Manager: Uh indeed indeed.
Marketing: Mm.
Project Manager: And and and the hard disk recorders. Um, furthermore, uh, w we need really need to interest uh {vocalsound} y younger customers and then with younger customers I mean people uh below the age of forty,
Marketing: Mm-hmm. {vocalsound}
Project Manager: and our our current customers are mainly forty plus
Marketing: Mm-hmm.
Project Manager: uh which well
Industrial Designer: Fourteen
Project Manager: {disfmarker} Forty.
Industrial Designer: or for O okay.
Project Manager: So
Industrial Designer: So {disfmarker}
Project Manager: that's to that's I mean there's a market but uh they will grow older {disfmarker} older
Marketing: {vocalsound} {vocalsound}
Project Manager: and you'll al {vocalsound} always need to have the the future with younger people.
Marketing: Mm-hmm.
Project Manager: Um therefore, {vocalsound} younger people like trendy {disfmarker} trendy designs, so that's w we should make our our our R_C_ as trendy as possible but it should also be uh have a reliable image, so when it looks too too spacey or too fancy people will think well does it work at all.
Marketing: Mm.
Project Manager: Hmm.
User Interface: Yeah it's uh well you you can follow the ideas how you want to keep the keys, you know right now if you take it you have like zero, one, two, three like a keys separately,
Marketing: Mm-hmm.
User Interface: but suppose if you take the the present trend of mobile phones there are like big thick keys
Marketing: Mm.
User Interface: you press on the top, it takes one number, you press on the bottom it takes another number, and uh basically uh uh so the space covered so that you don't see two separate keys there actually
Industrial Designer: {gap} Mm-hmm.
User Interface: so it it is like uh um i i it is like uh {disfmarker}
Marketing: Mm.
Project Manager: Ma Maybe Maybe you can draw it on the on the board uh {disfmarker}
Marketing: Mm. But I think taking the idea of getting inspiration from mobile phones is interesting, especially if we're going after a younger market,
User Interface: Yeah so.
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
Project Manager: Hmm. Yes yes
Marketing: that's the the the mm the new and the funky things,
Project Manager: mo
Industrial Designer: Because they are already used to that, you know, product.
Marketing: that's,
Project Manager: Yes it's recognisable {gap}
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
Marketing: yeah, there's lot there's lots of pretty mobile phones, not too many pretty remote controls.
Project Manager: Mm mm.
Marketing: That's {disfmarker}
Project Manager: And and they are skilled uh by using it.
Marketing: Mm.
User Interface: So for example uh {disfmarker} Well uh {vocalsound} {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Mm-hmm. . . .
User Interface: Okay, it works. Fine. So, for example you have uh presently uh keys like one, two, three like this, actually, and uh uh four five six like that and uh you can have keys like this in form like uh keys like that
Project Manager: Mael can you hand me over this uh?
Industrial Designer: Yes. {gap}
Project Manager: Uh thank you.
Marketing: Mm-hmm. Okay. How much longer have we got for the meeting by the way?
Project Manager: Mm well
Marketing:'Cause we haven't talked about demographic at all
Project Manager: I think fi five min
User Interface: Forty minutes?
Marketing: and it's a very important issue.
Project Manager: Mm-hmm.
User Interface: Yeah so you you you can have uh keys like uh which are which are like so. {vocalsound} too sorry, so we basically don't change the uh original order of them
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} {vocalsound}
User Interface: but then the keys are more spacious,
Marketing: Mm-hmm.
User Interface: they don't look uh {disfmarker} so there there is a very sligh thing, so if you press on the top it takes the one, it takes the three, uh four, sorry four here uh five and six,
Marketing: Mm. Mm.
User Interface: so the keys can be it looks you know not very much cluttered but it looks nice
Industrial Designer: Mm-hmm.
User Interface: for you don't have too many keys
Marketing: Mm.
User Interface: but you can have a lot of options t if you press on the to
Project Manager: Okay.'Kay I I think now that the idea's clear.
Industrial Designer: Yep.
Marketing: Mm.
Project Manager: Uh we should now uh try to decide um on our target group.
User Interface: Yeah.
Marketing: Yeah. Which I think is quite tricky.
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Marketing: Um, basically we're trying to get people to buy a remote control {vocalsound} {disfmarker}
User Interface: Yeah.
Marketing: wouldn't they already have a remote control with their television when they buy one?
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Of course they have already one. So our our our remote control has to be better.
Marketing: But it's not going to have more functionality,
User Interface: Mm-hmm.
Marketing:'cause it's only a low market, it's a cheap-end remote control, we can't beat modern functionality, we might {disfmarker} we'll be able to {vocalsound} beat them on th the look of it, th the design of it but that's not a big seller, if they're not just going to buy a new remote control just'cause it looks pretty, they have to actually need it as well.
Project Manager: Mm-hmm.
Marketing: So I'm not sure how we can get people to buy this thing.
Project Manager: Mm. I {disfmarker} well I think {vocalsound} many people said uh in your in in your research uh uh uh the appearance of the uh R_C_ is is important when they are buying one
Marketing: Mm. Yeah. But why are they buying one in the first place?
Project Manager: but {disfmarker} Indeed. So that will be about functionality {disfmarker}
Marketing: Mm. But if people are buying a new remote control for functionality they'll buy a universal remote. I've got friends who've got so many things they need a universal remote, otherwise they're using five different remotes for their all their things.
Project Manager: Mm. Mm-hmm. Mm.
Marketing: In that case they wouldn't buy our product, because it doesn't give them what they need in terms of functionality.
Project Manager: So your you think we should go for a more u universal high-performance {disfmarker}
Marketing: Well, we can't, with the price range. We We're not building a universal remote, we're not building a high end product.
Project Manager: What do {disfmarker} What do you think about {disfmarker} What componen
Industrial Designer: Yeah we have yeah twelve point five Euros uh per uh per R_ s R_C_
Marketing: Mm.
Industrial Designer: and I think uh with this now you know that chips are very uh cheaps
Marketing: Mm-hmm.
Industrial Designer: and uh we can include it in our control some new new features.
Marketing: Mm.
Industrial Designer: Yeah. And um {disfmarker} But yeah
Marketing: But {disfmarker} yeah. If we're getting into universal remote territory, we're getting to L_C_D_ screens and things like that
Industrial Designer: that's {disfmarker}
Marketing: which would drive the cost up a lot.
Project Manager: I don't know. I don't know whether that's necessary.
Industrial Designer: Ye
Project Manager: Is the L_C_D_ screen {disfmarker}
Marketing: For universal remotes {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: I don't think L_C_D_ is not necessary {disfmarker} well, th for long term.
Marketing: If you {disfmarker} mm.
Project Manager: I think thi this could be this could be a market because uh universal remote controls uh tend to be uh quite expensive.
Marketing: And quite complicated to use,
Project Manager: S so we can try to go in between,
Marketing: yes.
Project Manager: and offer a product which is not as expensive and not as complicated
Marketing: Mm-hmm. Not as flexible maybe, yeah, but s
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
Marketing: yeah.
Project Manager: but but still but still people have the idea this is more functional than a normal uh uh R_C_
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} Universal.
Marketing: Mm-hmm.
Project Manager: because it has more uh it it is in some kind universal.
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
Marketing: Mm-hmm.
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
Marketing: But if we're going for the say fifteen to twenty five age group then not many of them would actually own T_V_s to use a remote control on.
Project Manager: Mm yes but w we're targeting I think on more on the on the twenty to forty group.
Marketing: Okay. So they're {disfmarker} yeah.
Project Manager: People {disfmarker} yes. Who just have or already have a job and have the money but may not want to spend that much money on a on a universal universal control.
Marketing: Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yep. I don't know really what the the price range for remote controls is. Are we gonna be at the very bottom of the price range, or are we kind of middle to bottom? I don't know.
Project Manager: Uh well
Industrial Designer: Mm.
Project Manager: {vocalsound} I think uh when we think it over I thi I think we are trying to offer the a kind of universal control for for less money.
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Marketing: Mm. Mm-hmm.
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
Project Manager: So d Do you agree?
User Interface: Well {disfmarker} Well I it's fine with me like the price as long as it is uh not too expensive.
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} Yeah
User Interface: Uh and it d uh {disfmarker} Our provin
Industrial Designer: because we have to take into account that we are gonna b we are gonna sell uh four aro around four million so when we speak about these numbers uh the price of a chip is {vocalsound} uh price of a chip is very cheap.
Marketing: Mm.
User Interface: Mm.
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} So I'm okay for designing um a ne uh less {vocalsound} yeah a a kind of universal uh R_C_ yeah.
Project Manager: Mm-hmm. You think it's possible for the twelve Euro fifty?
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
Project Manager: Okay. Um so then we we decide on on on going to this more universal kind of control.
User Interface: Uh yeah, that's that's what we needed basically.
Marketing: Mm-hmm.
Project Manager: Mm. Mm. Okay.
User Interface: Uh that's needed right now. And uh basically you can look to the standards of other {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Yeah that's needed, yeah. {vocalsound}
Marketing: Mm. Yeah.
Industrial Designer: And if we want to get the market, we really need that.
Marketing: Yeah. So I guess what I'd like from a universal remote is maybe choosing between three devices, being able to switch between them, there may be stereo, V_C_R_ and T_V_.
User Interface: Actu
Industrial Designer: Yes. Exactly. {vocalsound}
User Interface: Yeah.
Marketing: And just be able to s use them all from the same remote, but not at the same time.
Project Manager: Yes.
User Interface: {vocalsound} Yeah you can also browse through all the standards you know, where are the limit of standards for all of them and you can just browse through them.
Industrial Designer: Is that okay for you? Yeah.
Project Manager: Mm mm mm mm.
Industrial Designer: Yeah. Yeah.
Project Manager: So given we are going for this uh uh universal type uh m {vocalsound} maybe it is good when you try to find out which components you therefore need and y you will try to get more specific uh user interface content
Industrial Designer: Yes.
Marketing: Mm.
User Interface: Okay. Okay.
Project Manager: and uh maybe you can look on on what trends are in this uh in this type of market.
Marketing: Mm-hmm yep.
User Interface: Voila {vocalsound}. Hmm.
Project Manager: So anyone uh has a point to bring in
User Interface: So. Well.
Project Manager: or shall we {disfmarker} no.
User Interface: Oh I don't have anything right now. We can we'll we'll go
Industrial Designer: Oh
Project Manager: Okay.
Industrial Designer: that's that's fine then.
User Interface: and we'll I'm sure we'll up something good
Marketing: Mm-hmm.
Project Manager: W yes,
User Interface: for the {vocalsound}
Project Manager: we uh we can have lunch now.
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
Marketing: Mm-hmm.
Project Manager: So um Then th th the next meeting will uh
User Interface: Yeah so we meet in {disfmarker} well {vocalsound} what are our {disfmarker}
Project Manager: after lunch you have uh we have uh thirty minutes of work and then we have the next meeting. But you will be informed via the computer.
User Interface: Okay.
Project Manager: Okay.
User Interface: Cool. So see you later.
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} Okay {vocalsound} perfect.","First of all, Project Manager launched a discussion about video over-demand, during which User Interface and Industrial Designer mentioned some fancy functions like downloading and streamlining. Then, Project Manager announced that according to the account manager, teletext could be included in the discussion, though its obsolescence incurred doubts over its usability and necessity. After that, Project Manager offered a choice question between television and further recording devices represented by DVDs, VCRs, and hard disk recorders. Finally, to cater for the younger people, User Interface devised big thick keys for RC in imitation of mobile phones, which received positive feedback from other team members.",qmsum
"Summarize the whole meeting.
User Interface: Okay.
Project Manager: So I see all everybody's here,'kay.
Marketing: Mm-hmm.
Industrial Designer: Yep.
Project Manager: And we can start meeting.
User Interface: Okay {vocalsound}.
Marketing: What's the agenda for this meeting?
Project Manager: The {disfmarker} I will uh present here agenda with with with with slides to you.
Marketing: Okay.
Project Manager: Um as you can see here.
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: Perfect.
Project Manager: So first uh just to mention I will take notes uh of this meeting
Marketing: Mm-hmm.
Project Manager: and uh I will try to work them out and give them to you. I've also made notes of the previous meeting and um I was about to send them you but {vocalsound} then uh I had to go to this uh meeting so you will get them too uh
Marketing: Mm-hmm.
User Interface: Next.
Project Manager: Um.
Industrial Designer: So y you are the secretary also.
Project Manager: Yes. Indeed.
Industrial Designer: Right? Okay.
Project Manager: Then I hope you all have uh worked out {vocalsound} some some uh {vocalsound} some some presentations about uh about well you the the task given to you in the previous meeting.
Industrial Designer: Perfectly yeah yeah of course uh-huh.
User Interface: {gap}
Project Manager: Um. W We will uh in a minute we will uh {vocalsound} start with them. Um, we will see in which order we will handle them of. Um then I will uh bring in some some some new requirements I I got uh from the uh account manager, I try to work them out, they were quite abstract, and we can have maybe have com some discussion about it. Uh Um about the functions
Marketing: Mm-hmm.
Project Manager: and {disfmarker} Well in this meeting we should really {vocalsound} try to reach a decision about the target group and the functionality of the {disfmarker}
Marketing: Mm.
Industrial Designer: You mean the social target group who we wants to target?
Project Manager: Yes I mean well yes w who are we going to uh to well to sell this,
Marketing: Mm.
User Interface: {gap}
Industrial Designer: Oh the customers, okay.
Marketing: Yeah.
Project Manager: the customers, indeed yes. Think that's that's important matter.
Marketing: That's the big question yeah.
Project Manager: Uh. {vocalsound} So {vocalsound} And then uh we will close this meeting uh
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: and after this meeting we'll uh we'll have a lunch. Good. Um. Maybe um why uh Anna can you c do you have a presentations?
Marketing: No, I don't.
Project Manager: You don't have presentation?
Marketing: I wasn't. No.
Project Manager: Uh you want a table to to uh
Marketing: I c I can talk about it but I have no slides or anything.
Project Manager: Yes yes maybe maybe you can uh can just talk about it or maybe you can use the whiteboard if necessary um.
Marketing: Mm-hmm. Well I've just been um presented with some research we've done in a small focus group so, a hundred people, just asked them about their remote control usage habits and what they want in a remote control. Um. It's {disfmarker} probably can't email this to you, I've just got a web page with some data on it. Um basically it's saying that users generally dislike the look and feel of their remote controls. Um seventy five u seventy five percent of users find most remote controls ugly. Um.
Project Manager: Mm-hmm.
Marketing: Eighty percent of users would spend more money when a remote control would look fancy. Um. Current remote controls do not match well the operating behaviour of the user. Uh seventy five percent of users said they zap a lot, so they use their remote control quite frequently while they're watching television. Uh. Fifty percent of users say that they only use ten percent of the buttons, so they've got a remote control with a lot of functionality but really most of the time they only use a small part of that.
Project Manager: Mm.
Marketing: Um.
Project Manager: Do you Do you have this uh information on the web page you said?
Marketing: I have an a web page yes.
Project Manager: Yes, mayb maybe you can can send an email to me later uh. Uh about this.
Marketing: Yep. Yep, sure. Mm-hmm. So basically um there's a breakdown of how much they use the different functions on a rem remote control. Um, power and volume selection are only used a few times within this uh per hour. Um, channel selection is used a hundred and sixty eight times um {vocalsound} and then there's things like channel settings, audio settings, which are only used very infrequently.
Project Manager: Mm.
Marketing: Um. Teletext is used um fourteen times in the hour, so it is used but not nearly as much as the channel selection is used. Um.
Project Manager: Mm.
Marketing: An interesting thing that this report has brought up is that um fifty fifty percent of users report that the remote control gets lost a lot of the time in the room, so some way of some way of locating the remote control would be very useful to a lot of users. Um.
Project Manager: Yes yes, I have {vocalsound} that too {vocalsound}.
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Marketing: Thirty four percent said it takes too long to learn to use a remote control, they want something that's easier to use straight away, more intuitive perhaps.
Project Manager: Mm.
Marketing: Um.
Industrial Designer: It's it's easy to learn or how do you say it's {disfmarker}
Marketing: Thirty four percent said it took too much time to learn to use a new one. Yep.
Industrial Designer: Okay too much time to learn. Okay.
Marketing: Um. And thirty {disfmarker} twenty six percent said remote controls are bad for R_S_I_.
Industrial Designer: Not enough {gap}
Marketing: I don't know how we'd go about combating that.
User Interface: {gap}. What do you mean there?
Marketing: For R_S_I_? Respet Repetitive strain injury.
User Interface: Okay.
Marketing: So. But {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Mm. They think that or do their doctor the doctor says?
Marketing: Mm.
Project Manager: {vocalsound} But it's it's the opinion of the uh of the users huh?
Marketing: Yeah. That's what the report says yeah.
Project Manager: So mm.
Marketing: Um and then it's got a demographic breakdown on {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Maybe y y you cannot put this webpage online on the {disfmarker}
Marketing: Uh I should be able to actually, if I email it to you now.
User Interface: You can disconnect it there
Project Manager: {vocalsound} You can maybe just just {disfmarker}
User Interface: no?
Marketing: Oh no, yeah.
Industrial Designer: Ah it's {vocalsound} it okay it's a webpage on the C_ it's a file
Marketing: Yeah.
Industrial Designer: okay.
Marketing: Um, s hang on.
Industrial Designer: O otherwise you yeah. You can connect this one.
Project Manager: {gap}
User Interface: Then you can connect this one or this one yeah.
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
User Interface: All to your computer.
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
Marketing: Well.
Industrial Designer: So these are important numbers that Matthew and I need to take into account for our functional um {disfmarker}
User Interface: Oh yeah.
Project Manager: {gap}
Marketing: Oh I need to muck around with this. It's probably easier if you put it on yours and then I'll just email it to you. It's just a web link.
Project Manager: Hmm.
Industrial Designer: Yeah {gap}
User Interface: Okay.
Industrial Designer: Yeah these numbers have have to be have to be taken into account for the uh both yeah user interface and functional design.
User Interface: Hmm. {vocalsound} Yeah.
Marketing: One thing it goes on to talk about, which is interesting, is the {disfmarker} hang on a minute.
Industrial Designer: Because if there are many numbers and we need to select to to constraint uh our design based on what is more important.
Marketing: Mm-hmm. Yep.
Project Manager: Mm-hmm.
Marketing: Um, one thing is interesting is talking about um speech recognition in a remote control.
Industrial Designer: Speech recognition in {disfmarker}
Marketing: And who would pay more for that and whether people would find it useful.
Project Manager: D do you have numbers o o on that?
Industrial Designer: Ah okay.
Marketing: Yes, I'll just get this up.
Industrial Designer: So that we don't {disfmarker} Do we not need any button on the remote control {vocalsound}
Marketing: Well potentially yeah, um {disfmarker}
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: it would be all based on speech.
Marketing: I think even for interesti
Industrial Designer: Okay. Interesting idea.
Marketing: yeah I think that would not work so well. You wanna have both options.
Industrial Designer: Okay.
Project Manager: Well it would it would be a solution for uh when your remote control is lost,
Marketing: Mm-hmm.
Project Manager: I mean when it has speech recognition then uh i then it doesn't matter where it is, my {disfmarker} well it's {disfmarker} we should be in range,
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
Marketing: Mm.
Project Manager: or maybe it can respond and produce sound, so say where it is. But the these are all quite fancy features
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
Project Manager: I'm not sure whether we will we can make this for {vocalsound} for twelve Euro fi and fifty cents {vocalsound}.
User Interface: Well it would be f
Marketing: Yeah.
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
User Interface: No you can't.
Industrial Designer: And we don't know where the state of the art of speech recognition is, maybe you know?
User Interface: Oh. Well, {vocalsound} it depends you know like there is uh it's a very small vocabulary that you want to do the operations like you want to say on, off, one, two, twenty three,
Project Manager: Mm.
Industrial Designer: But it's quite noisy if there is the T_V_ uh shouting.
Marketing: Mm.
User Interface: yeah.
Marketing: Yeah.
Project Manager: Yes,
User Interface: It's it's going to be li
Project Manager: that that that that's mm.
User Interface: it's not going to be s so easy but u usually it's going to be more of an isolated case
Project Manager: Do you have some more important facts
User Interface: but it's {disfmarker} but I don't know with twenty fi
Marketing: Um {disfmarker}
Project Manager: or can we go to the next presentation?
Industrial Designer: Okay. So
Marketing: Well {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: you had to to to summarise maybe the {disfmarker}
Marketing: This is now talking about um who would pay for speech recognition in a remote control, who would pay more for it, um. Ninety percent of the fifteen to twenty five year old market said that they would pay more, it goes down from there, seventy six percent for twenty five to thirty five, thirty five percent for thirty five to forty five, um twenty two percent for forty five to fifty five and then eight percent for fifty five to sixty five.
Project Manager: Mm.
User Interface: Okay it's uh decline.
Marketing: Yeah.
User Interface: Okay.
Marketing: But we sh
Project Manager: Mm-hmm. Decline with age, mm.
Marketing: Yeah, it really depends where we're gonna be targeting this product, um,
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Mm. {vocalsound}
Marketing: which we'll be talking about later I think.
Industrial Designer: Mm.
Project Manager: Yes. We will talk about it later. {vocalsound}
Marketing: Did you get the email?
Project Manager: Okay. {vocalsound}
Marketing: Yep, that one.
Industrial Designer: Mm-hmm.
Marketing: Just follow that link.
Industrial Designer: {gap} I thi {vocalsound} You us
Marketing: It'll be in a different window, yep.
Industrial Designer: yeah yeah.
Marketing: That's {disfmarker} left {disfmarker} that one.
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
Marketing: Yep.
Industrial Designer: Okay perfect. . . .
Marketing: Mm. So that's the figure that I was just talking about there, with the different demographics.
User Interface: Okay.
Marketing: Another thing it's talking about there is the L_C_D_ screen but there's no figures apparently on that.
Project Manager: Mm. Okay. {vocalsound} um
Industrial Designer: Mm'kay.
Project Manager: Uh maybe uh Mael c c can you give uh uh your presentation uh?
Industrial Designer: Yeah. Mm I okay
Project Manager: Oh,
Industrial Designer: I stay {disfmarker}
Project Manager: this is {disfmarker}
User Interface: Now you can move I think yeah.
Project Manager: Mm-hmm, y y you can move, uh.
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} I can move as far as {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Maybe I take your chair?
Project Manager: Yes. You can you can sa take my chair.
Industrial Designer: I okay {vocalsound}.
User Interface: It's a channel selection, a module {gap}, this and this function,
Marketing: Sorry? Oh.
User Interface: go to the {gap}. Yeah.
Industrial Designer: So I think as everybody knows uh I'm the uh Industrial Designer. And uh in this presentation uh this group presentation um {vocalsound} is gonna focus on the working design of the the remote control. Um I'd like first to give a quick a very simple introduction, how does it work, so that everybody knows even if you don't have a very uh technical background uh what is it because I think in the product it is important.
Marketing: Mm. {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: So basically um the basic function of a remote control is to send uh messages to another system that is fixed.
Marketing: Mm-hmm.
Industrial Designer: And so an energy source feeds an integrated circuit, the chip, that can compose messages, usually uh through a um infrared bit
Marketing: Mm-hmm.
Industrial Designer: and uh the user interface controls the chip and accordingly the the messages, alright. So my method for um designing the yeah the work design uh yeah first {vocalsound} the the main point is that I would wish to to make a really functional product. I would prefer to have very functional um capabilities rather than fancy stuff that in fact is not used and doesn't work.
Marketing: Mm-hmm.
Project Manager: Mm.
Industrial Designer: So for that yeah as it's important to take into account the user requirements from the Marketing uh Expert uh Anna
Marketing: Mm-hmm.
Industrial Designer: and um w to to we should agree on what are the technical functions uh for this remote control and I show you the the working design. So um basically uh here is a really large view of what we want {vocalsound}. Uh we want an on off button, it can be uh {disfmarker} it's simple but it's it's important, and also uh {gap} the to both channels as well as other buttons that come after,
Marketing: Mm.
Industrial Designer: right. So the components I quickly draw here, is that in this part you have the remote control the the sender and on the other part the receiver so that's {disfmarker} my method is um will be to well my aim would be to uh design the and choose the chips and the infrared um components to build the remote control
Marketing: Mm-hmm.
Industrial Designer: right.
Project Manager: Mm-hmm.
Industrial Designer: So of course we need energy sources and uh uh the receiver a a receiver. This is {vocalsound} very quick uh design, uh you stop me or interrupt me if uh you don't agree on it on that.
Project Manager: Mm-hmm.
Industrial Designer: And um so what I have found and {vocalsound} after a lot of work actually I {vocalsound} I draw this I draw for you this uh schema
Marketing: {vocalsound} Well. {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Uh-huh.
Industrial Designer: that can be maybe too technical for you but is very important for me
Marketing: You drew it a long time ago?
Industrial Designer: you know.
Project Manager: Is huh
Marketing: Ninety one. {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} And uh that's it so I won't go into details about that
Project Manager: overwhelming {vocalsound}.
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: No.
Industrial Designer: but uh these are my preferences to use uh that kind of components.
Project Manager: {vocalsound} And and why do you want these kind of component?
Industrial Designer: So. So
Project Manager: I mean, are they cheap, or are they uh reliable? What were your {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: found and yeah th you have always a compromise with uh reliability and uh i if it's expensive,
Project Manager: Mm.
Industrial Designer: but uh this one was not this one also really uh reliable um so yeah that's it for the working design, uh I hope you get clearer view on uh what what a remote control is uh in terms of uh technical components
Project Manager: Yes. It it it's more clear now I think.
Industrial Designer: but maybe yeah {disfmarker}
Project Manager: So {vocalsound} {disfmarker}
User Interface: But is it uh can you just buy it on the market and f plug it in or you want to ma
Industrial Designer: No no no no we we will uh {disfmarker} This is a preference but we can always change uh {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Mm-hmm. What I w what I was thinking about uh the the the schema uh about uh the sender and the receiver, I mean can you can you get back to it?
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
Project Manager: {vocalsound} Yeah uh, the receiver is of course already in the television and we are not uh able to change it. So we we must adapt to the to the receiver.
Industrial Designer: Of course yeah.
Project Manager: I I suppose there is a standard uh way of communicating to televisions uh.
Industrial Designer: Yeah. We will use uh {vocalsound} infrared protocol uh using {vocalsound} yeah infrared and uh and of course we need to adapt to that protocol that already exists
Project Manager: Mm-hmm.
Industrial Designer: and but we what we can do is uh uh adapting {vocalsound} the the chips inside uh to the best uh chips and uh infrared bubbles.
Project Manager: Mm. Mm. Mm. Mm. Yes. Okay.
Industrial Designer: Um. Okay. {gap}
Project Manager: Thank you.
User Interface: Well it to du it's just you had to change the frequencies.
Industrial Designer: The frequencies?
User Interface: Yeah.
Industrial Designer: Yeah yeah. Of course yeah
User Interface: {vocalsound} But you should be careful,
Industrial Designer: in the chip you have it yeah.
User Interface: people are sometime becoming problem, like a guy has recently designed a remote uh uh uh which could switch off any other T_V_s {vocalsound}, so basically {gap} through all the things.
Industrial Designer: That can control o other things. Yeah.
Marketing: Ah.
Project Manager: Mm.
User Interface: So maybe we should think of {vocalsound}
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: Of course yeah we should take that into account
Marketing: That's handy.
Project Manager: Yeah yes
Marketing: So if the b T_V_ in the next apartment's really loud, you can just turn it off.
Project Manager: I I I {disfmarker}
User Interface: yeah.
Industrial Designer: in the uh {disfmarker}
User Interface: {vocalsound} Yeah so you can just go on the street and then switch off everyone's T_V_ {vocalsound} and you can just walk away {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
User Interface: You don't have to be near the T_V_ at all {vocalsound}.
Marketing: Yeah. I like that idea.
Project Manager: I I feel I I I think M Mael will will consider this uh th these things.
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Maybe Maybe we can go to to your presentation uh Matthew.
User Interface: Yeah
Project Manager: I I I assume you were finished here.
User Interface: so {vocalsound}.
Industrial Designer: Yes.
Project Manager: Uh okay.
User Interface: Okay. {vocalsound} So I can take I think mine now there.
Industrial Designer: Okay.
User Interface: Okay so voila.
Marketing: {vocalsound}
User Interface: Hmm I can take mine it's okay, voila, mm so mm. Okay.
Project Manager: Oh. I {disfmarker} Uh, sorry? I know where it is.
User Interface: It's on the desktop.
Project Manager: It's uh {disfmarker}
User Interface: Technical function.
Project Manager: Yes.
User Interface: Okay.
Project Manager: It's uh {disfmarker}
User Interface: Like so.
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
User Interface: Well. So um I'm going to talk a little bit about the technical function so wha what actually it's about what is the user going to do, I think my last presented what is going inside,
Marketing: Mm-hmm. Yep.
User Interface: so what's the user is going to see from the outside and how he is going to use it. So well the approach is that uh basically the idea is to send a message to the T_V_ set, as Mael has pointed, and it will be decoded by the T_V_ and usually we it is easier to have uh keys or buttons with which people can uh press and then um changing a button will basically uh change the message which is being sent to the T_V_ and uh {vocalsound} um
Industrial Designer: Mm-hmm.
User Interface: a and basically it sends an internal signal and decoded by the receiver. So p as um Anna has said that this ki people are interested in things which are you don't need to k press the keys, people are can have a speech recognition but this is uh s a question which will we have to see later.
Project Manager: Mm-hmm.
User Interface: But in the present scenario is that you have certain keys and you press it like your mobile phone, and it sends a message to the T_V_.
Project Manager: Mm.
Industrial Designer: Yep.
User Interface: {vocalsound} And um so generally mm I don't have some figures sorry but um so there are two kinds of uh remote if you popularly in the household, actually so you have a standard T_V_ remote where you have just a on, off button and play, uh volume change and uh keys for the number and more than one digit option. And if you see for example righ right now uh uh even the one uh on more than one digit option is for two digit channel which is like ninety nine, but {vocalsound} tomorrow you might have one fifty channels you know to browse or two hundred channels to browse who knows, but uh uh. Then there is uh {vocalsound} this is the standard one with without any fancy thing you know like i it doesn't have teletext option, it can without any, it's a very simple thing, um which which you can vouch {vocalsound}. And then you have uh what's the v video remote file which is like usually it has almost all the keys over there and, but it then it has other options like stop uh and then you play the movie or uh or fo fast forward the movie or something like that so i it has those
Marketing: Mm-hmm.
User Interface: so these are the standard uh commonly found remote controls in the uh market. And then {disfmarker} whi which is generally used by the people. And then {vocalsound} well personal preferences I would {disfmarker} uh basically think of having a kind of aim for the next generation thing where the {disfmarker} we could have both the uh the f a T_V_ and the remote {disfmarker} video remote control because uh some of the keys in the video's remote control and the T_V_ they could be integrated together so that uh we could um aim for the like in the f coming future um that type of uh applications with {disfmarker}
Marketing: Okay. How would that work? So you've got say maybe a V_C_R_ and a T_V_ which are separate,
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Marketing: so you {disfmarker} on my one at home I've got a V_C_R_ remote which then changes the channel on the V_C_R_ and doesn't do anything on the T_V_,
User Interface: Yeah.
Marketing: so is it gonna be like a switch on the remote that says t use the T_V_ or use the V_C_R_?
User Interface: Yeah.
Marketing: or does it know which one you want to use?
User Interface: Um actually um you could you could think of um having s a y you can have a key which could tell y it could go to the video thing
Marketing: Mm-hmm.
User Interface: but um uh yo you you you still can't um in that case when it you use that the function should be able to take up the V_C_R_ option
Marketing: Mm-hmm.
User Interface: and you could play it or {disfmarker} You can also think about having like um {vocalsound} {disfmarker} I in a few days you will be ha in in few ye coming years you might even have a system where you have a separate uh sitting setup box
Marketing: Mm-hmm.
User Interface: and uh you have uh um something like uh uh you do you do you suppose you are not able to watch some programme and actually it downloading all the time for you
Marketing: Mm-hmm. Mm.
User Interface: and uh you can just you know uh when you come back you could just switch on that thing and uh watch a program.
Marketing: Mm.
User Interface: In that case you want to browse faster, browse slow, you want to have those kind of functionalities {vocalsound}.
Marketing: Mm.
Project Manager: Mm mm mm mm mm.
Marketing: Mm.
Industrial Designer: These are kind of next generation {vocalsound} functionalities.
User Interface: It's the next generation thing,
Project Manager: Mm yes,
User Interface: but it is going to come in couple of years.
Marketing: Mm.
Project Manager: but I think it's i i it's already there,
User Interface: It's goi
Project Manager: I mean the hard disk uh recorders uh I I've seen them in the shop.
User Interface: Yeah it's {disfmarker}
Marketing: Mm.
User Interface: Yeah.
Marketing: Yeah.
User Interface: Yeah. So
Industrial Designer: Mm'kay.
User Interface: it's going to record your things and you and you you need basically the functionalities what you need in both uh uh video as well as in the standard T_V_ thing.
Marketing: Mm. Yeah. That's fair enough. Mm. But I don't think we're trying to make a universal remote here. That's,
User Interface: No no we are not making a universal remote,
Marketing: yeah.
User Interface: we are just looking at uh giving a scenario, I have a T_V_ and tomorrow I am going to have set up box
Marketing: Mm.
User Interface: which is going to sit there and uh it's going to do that job for me.
Marketing: Mm. Because y
Project Manager: W w w w we need to decide on on on on in how far we go to in this.
Marketing: Mm-hmm. Mm.
Project Manager: Mean, you can go {vocalsound} pretty far I f I think with with with functions and possible uh future p uh prospects
Marketing: Mm. Yep.
Project Manager: yes.
User Interface: Yeah. So {vocalsound}
Project Manager: But it's good to keep in mind.
Marketing: Mm.
User Interface: Okay so that p ends my presentation.
Project Manager: Mm. Very well.
User Interface: Well. So we can always discuss about it for example uh the presently the video market actually uh this demand, video over-demand or what we call it as, it's presently {vocalsound} booming up actually
Industrial Designer: Mm-hmm.
Marketing: Mm. Yeah.
User Interface: so it i like people are providing like uh things like uh uh movies, you can select actually so you want to watch a movie and uh your p your provider gives a list of movies, and then you select those list.
Marketing: Mm-hmm.
User Interface: And it
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
User Interface: basically you go off, it downloads the movie, it gives for you
Marketing: Mm.
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
User Interface: and then when you come you want to loo watch it on your T_V_.
Project Manager: Good.
User Interface: And thi this is going to come.
Industrial Designer: Or even you don't need to download it, it's streamed uh online uh yeah. Yeah.
User Interface: Yeah it can be streamed online for you and you can say what time I want to watch the movie
Marketing: Mm.
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
User Interface: and {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
User Interface: Yeah
Project Manager: Um, so u um
User Interface: so. Yeah.
Project Manager: I have uh received some some some some well points of of thinking over of my account manager and uh I would like to share them with you. Um
Marketing: Mm-hmm.
Industrial Designer: Mm-hmm.
Project Manager: first thing is uh teletext is a well known feature of televisions
Marketing: Mm-hmm.
Project Manager: but it's it's getting used less and less.
User Interface: {vocalsound} Yeah.
Project Manager: That's that's especially because of the internet of course.
Marketing: Hmm.
Project Manager: So we should think about it um. Do we include it, and do we give it a prominent uh prominent uh place on on on the on well huh on the remote mot control itself.
Marketing: Mm.
Project Manager: Uh as uh a in any case it's it's not used, well very much, but it's it is still used. Um
Marketing: Mm.
User Interface: Um.
Project Manager: further yes we must think, uh do we stay uh to to television only, the television as we as we all know it with with broadcasting signals and you can't go back uh huh, or do we uh uh go further as Matthew indicated by supporting uh uh recording uh devices?
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Marketing: So D_V_D_s and V_C_R_s?
Project Manager: Uh indeed indeed.
Marketing: Mm.
Project Manager: And and and the hard disk recorders. Um, furthermore, uh, w we need really need to interest uh {vocalsound} y younger customers and then with younger customers I mean people uh below the age of forty,
Marketing: Mm-hmm. {vocalsound}
Project Manager: and our our current customers are mainly forty plus
Marketing: Mm-hmm.
Project Manager: uh which well
Industrial Designer: Fourteen
Project Manager: {disfmarker} Forty.
Industrial Designer: or for O okay.
Project Manager: So
Industrial Designer: So {disfmarker}
Project Manager: that's to that's I mean there's a market but uh they will grow older {disfmarker} older
Marketing: {vocalsound} {vocalsound}
Project Manager: and you'll al {vocalsound} always need to have the the future with younger people.
Marketing: Mm-hmm.
Project Manager: Um therefore, {vocalsound} younger people like trendy {disfmarker} trendy designs, so that's w we should make our our our R_C_ as trendy as possible but it should also be uh have a reliable image, so when it looks too too spacey or too fancy people will think well does it work at all.
Marketing: Mm.
Project Manager: Hmm.
User Interface: Yeah it's uh well you you can follow the ideas how you want to keep the keys, you know right now if you take it you have like zero, one, two, three like a keys separately,
Marketing: Mm-hmm.
User Interface: but suppose if you take the the present trend of mobile phones there are like big thick keys
Marketing: Mm.
User Interface: you press on the top, it takes one number, you press on the bottom it takes another number, and uh basically uh uh so the space covered so that you don't see two separate keys there actually
Industrial Designer: {gap} Mm-hmm.
User Interface: so it it is like uh um i i it is like uh {disfmarker}
Marketing: Mm.
Project Manager: Ma Maybe Maybe you can draw it on the on the board uh {disfmarker}
Marketing: Mm. But I think taking the idea of getting inspiration from mobile phones is interesting, especially if we're going after a younger market,
User Interface: Yeah so.
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
Project Manager: Hmm. Yes yes
Marketing: that's the the the mm the new and the funky things,
Project Manager: mo
Industrial Designer: Because they are already used to that, you know, product.
Marketing: that's,
Project Manager: Yes it's recognisable {gap}
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
Marketing: yeah, there's lot there's lots of pretty mobile phones, not too many pretty remote controls.
Project Manager: Mm mm.
Marketing: That's {disfmarker}
Project Manager: And and they are skilled uh by using it.
Marketing: Mm.
User Interface: So for example uh {disfmarker} Well uh {vocalsound} {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Mm-hmm. . . .
User Interface: Okay, it works. Fine. So, for example you have uh presently uh keys like one, two, three like this, actually, and uh uh four five six like that and uh you can have keys like this in form like uh keys like that
Project Manager: Mael can you hand me over this uh?
Industrial Designer: Yes. {gap}
Project Manager: Uh thank you.
Marketing: Mm-hmm. Okay. How much longer have we got for the meeting by the way?
Project Manager: Mm well
Marketing:'Cause we haven't talked about demographic at all
Project Manager: I think fi five min
User Interface: Forty minutes?
Marketing: and it's a very important issue.
Project Manager: Mm-hmm.
User Interface: Yeah so you you you can have uh keys like uh which are which are like so. {vocalsound} too sorry, so we basically don't change the uh original order of them
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} {vocalsound}
User Interface: but then the keys are more spacious,
Marketing: Mm-hmm.
User Interface: they don't look uh {disfmarker} so there there is a very sligh thing, so if you press on the top it takes the one, it takes the three, uh four, sorry four here uh five and six,
Marketing: Mm. Mm.
User Interface: so the keys can be it looks you know not very much cluttered but it looks nice
Industrial Designer: Mm-hmm.
User Interface: for you don't have too many keys
Marketing: Mm.
User Interface: but you can have a lot of options t if you press on the to
Project Manager: Okay.'Kay I I think now that the idea's clear.
Industrial Designer: Yep.
Marketing: Mm.
Project Manager: Uh we should now uh try to decide um on our target group.
User Interface: Yeah.
Marketing: Yeah. Which I think is quite tricky.
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Marketing: Um, basically we're trying to get people to buy a remote control {vocalsound} {disfmarker}
User Interface: Yeah.
Marketing: wouldn't they already have a remote control with their television when they buy one?
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Of course they have already one. So our our our remote control has to be better.
Marketing: But it's not going to have more functionality,
User Interface: Mm-hmm.
Marketing:'cause it's only a low market, it's a cheap-end remote control, we can't beat modern functionality, we might {disfmarker} we'll be able to {vocalsound} beat them on th the look of it, th the design of it but that's not a big seller, if they're not just going to buy a new remote control just'cause it looks pretty, they have to actually need it as well.
Project Manager: Mm-hmm.
Marketing: So I'm not sure how we can get people to buy this thing.
Project Manager: Mm. I {disfmarker} well I think {vocalsound} many people said uh in your in in your research uh uh uh the appearance of the uh R_C_ is is important when they are buying one
Marketing: Mm. Yeah. But why are they buying one in the first place?
Project Manager: but {disfmarker} Indeed. So that will be about functionality {disfmarker}
Marketing: Mm. But if people are buying a new remote control for functionality they'll buy a universal remote. I've got friends who've got so many things they need a universal remote, otherwise they're using five different remotes for their all their things.
Project Manager: Mm. Mm-hmm. Mm.
Marketing: In that case they wouldn't buy our product, because it doesn't give them what they need in terms of functionality.
Project Manager: So your you think we should go for a more u universal high-performance {disfmarker}
Marketing: Well, we can't, with the price range. We We're not building a universal remote, we're not building a high end product.
Project Manager: What do {disfmarker} What do you think about {disfmarker} What componen
Industrial Designer: Yeah we have yeah twelve point five Euros uh per uh per R_ s R_C_
Marketing: Mm.
Industrial Designer: and I think uh with this now you know that chips are very uh cheaps
Marketing: Mm-hmm.
Industrial Designer: and uh we can include it in our control some new new features.
Marketing: Mm.
Industrial Designer: Yeah. And um {disfmarker} But yeah
Marketing: But {disfmarker} yeah. If we're getting into universal remote territory, we're getting to L_C_D_ screens and things like that
Industrial Designer: that's {disfmarker}
Marketing: which would drive the cost up a lot.
Project Manager: I don't know. I don't know whether that's necessary.
Industrial Designer: Ye
Project Manager: Is the L_C_D_ screen {disfmarker}
Marketing: For universal remotes {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: I don't think L_C_D_ is not necessary {disfmarker} well, th for long term.
Marketing: If you {disfmarker} mm.
Project Manager: I think thi this could be this could be a market because uh universal remote controls uh tend to be uh quite expensive.
Marketing: And quite complicated to use,
Project Manager: S so we can try to go in between,
Marketing: yes.
Project Manager: and offer a product which is not as expensive and not as complicated
Marketing: Mm-hmm. Not as flexible maybe, yeah, but s
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
Marketing: yeah.
Project Manager: but but still but still people have the idea this is more functional than a normal uh uh R_C_
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} Universal.
Marketing: Mm-hmm.
Project Manager: because it has more uh it it is in some kind universal.
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
Marketing: Mm-hmm.
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
Marketing: But if we're going for the say fifteen to twenty five age group then not many of them would actually own T_V_s to use a remote control on.
Project Manager: Mm yes but w we're targeting I think on more on the on the twenty to forty group.
Marketing: Okay. So they're {disfmarker} yeah.
Project Manager: People {disfmarker} yes. Who just have or already have a job and have the money but may not want to spend that much money on a on a universal universal control.
Marketing: Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yep. I don't know really what the the price range for remote controls is. Are we gonna be at the very bottom of the price range, or are we kind of middle to bottom? I don't know.
Project Manager: Uh well
Industrial Designer: Mm.
Project Manager: {vocalsound} I think uh when we think it over I thi I think we are trying to offer the a kind of universal control for for less money.
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Marketing: Mm. Mm-hmm.
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
Project Manager: So d Do you agree?
User Interface: Well {disfmarker} Well I it's fine with me like the price as long as it is uh not too expensive.
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} Yeah
User Interface: Uh and it d uh {disfmarker} Our provin
Industrial Designer: because we have to take into account that we are gonna b we are gonna sell uh four aro around four million so when we speak about these numbers uh the price of a chip is {vocalsound} uh price of a chip is very cheap.
Marketing: Mm.
User Interface: Mm.
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} So I'm okay for designing um a ne uh less {vocalsound} yeah a a kind of universal uh R_C_ yeah.
Project Manager: Mm-hmm. You think it's possible for the twelve Euro fifty?
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
Project Manager: Okay. Um so then we we decide on on on going to this more universal kind of control.
User Interface: Uh yeah, that's that's what we needed basically.
Marketing: Mm-hmm.
Project Manager: Mm. Mm. Okay.
User Interface: Uh that's needed right now. And uh basically you can look to the standards of other {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Yeah that's needed, yeah. {vocalsound}
Marketing: Mm. Yeah.
Industrial Designer: And if we want to get the market, we really need that.
Marketing: Yeah. So I guess what I'd like from a universal remote is maybe choosing between three devices, being able to switch between them, there may be stereo, V_C_R_ and T_V_.
User Interface: Actu
Industrial Designer: Yes. Exactly. {vocalsound}
User Interface: Yeah.
Marketing: And just be able to s use them all from the same remote, but not at the same time.
Project Manager: Yes.
User Interface: {vocalsound} Yeah you can also browse through all the standards you know, where are the limit of standards for all of them and you can just browse through them.
Industrial Designer: Is that okay for you? Yeah.
Project Manager: Mm mm mm mm.
Industrial Designer: Yeah. Yeah.
Project Manager: So given we are going for this uh uh universal type uh m {vocalsound} maybe it is good when you try to find out which components you therefore need and y you will try to get more specific uh user interface content
Industrial Designer: Yes.
Marketing: Mm.
User Interface: Okay. Okay.
Project Manager: and uh maybe you can look on on what trends are in this uh in this type of market.
Marketing: Mm-hmm yep.
User Interface: Voila {vocalsound}. Hmm.
Project Manager: So anyone uh has a point to bring in
User Interface: So. Well.
Project Manager: or shall we {disfmarker} no.
User Interface: Oh I don't have anything right now. We can we'll we'll go
Industrial Designer: Oh
Project Manager: Okay.
Industrial Designer: that's that's fine then.
User Interface: and we'll I'm sure we'll up something good
Marketing: Mm-hmm.
Project Manager: W yes,
User Interface: for the {vocalsound}
Project Manager: we uh we can have lunch now.
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
Marketing: Mm-hmm.
Project Manager: So um Then th th the next meeting will uh
User Interface: Yeah so we meet in {disfmarker} well {vocalsound} what are our {disfmarker}
Project Manager: after lunch you have uh we have uh thirty minutes of work and then we have the next meeting. But you will be informed via the computer.
User Interface: Okay.
Project Manager: Okay.
User Interface: Cool. So see you later.
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} Okay {vocalsound} perfect.","The whole meeting was focused on the target group and the functionality of the new remote control product. After Project Manager briefly reaffirmed the meeting procedure, Marketing, Industrial Designer, and User Interface each gave a presentation about trend-watching, working design, technical function respectively. Then, Project Manager started a group discussion about the demand for teletext and video, for which thick key design was accepted as a feasible solution. Then, the group discussed the target group based on the predetermined budget, and accepted universality as an important feature.",qmsum
"Summarize the recap of the last meeting.
Project Manager: Okay. Hello everyone. {vocalsound} {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: Hi.
User Interface: Hi.
Marketing: Hi.
Project Manager: Um how uh how we doing?
Industrial Designer: Yeah, good.
Project Manager: Uh first we going uh over the minutes of the last meeting, more or less.
User Interface: Mm-hmm.
Project Manager: Um in the last meeting uh the marketing manager had presented uh her method of working, meaning gathering i suggestions from everyone to see how she best could market uh this this product at the {disfmarker} within the budget uh that was given. Uh in general {vocalsound} the idea is that it should be something that is not difficult to use. Um it's also an item that people lose a lot. So we should address that. And, of course, it should be something s s that is very simple to use. In addition to that to make it sell, of course, uh the marketing manager w wishes that it be very attractive,
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: or like she says put some sizzle into it in one way or another so that the people are buying it now because, in particular with smaller items, that's a very important fact,'cause um if they say, well, I go home and think about it, that won't work. Um also mentioned was it should be uh {disfmarker} it should have a very short learning curve. And maybe it could be sold by using a slogan.
Industrial Designer: Hmm.
Project Manager: {vocalsound} Our technical manager has then said that she feels it should have a chip
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: that has infra-red bits and it has an interface controls w interface that controls the chip. Therefore, messages uh will be controlled in the same manner. There should be extra features like lid buttons, maybe a beep. If too many buttons are pressed, mm uh uh child lock um and uh maybe a display clock so that people could um {disfmarker} you could see the time, you know, what show they want to watch. Also mentioned was uh maybe different shapes. So the components of the thing should be button, bulbs, infra infra-red bulbs, battery, chips, wires, and maybe some kind of a holder uh for the for the uh item. Francino who is our um
User Interface: Interface designer.
Project Manager: interface designer um uh has mentioned that the {disfmarker} that it, of course, should have an on-off button, and also has mentioned an interesting feature that it should have maybe a channel lock. Particularly with maybe small children that they couldn't uh watch a channel that is undesirable. It should be compact. Her personal favourite was it should be T-shaped. And maybe have an anar alarm-clock. And the material should possibly be not of non-allergic nature. Uh the different systems uh that exist are infra-red or radio-waves. Uh maybe it should have uh electri electrici electricity saving feature.
Marketing: {vocalsound} {vocalsound}
Project Manager: And {vocalsound} even possibly a timer to {disfmarker} so that people can program {vocalsound} their favourite uh uh program on th right from the remote.
User Interface: Yes.
Project Manager: Uh are we all in agreement that that's about what we discussed last time? Okay.
User Interface: Yes.
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
Marketing: Yeah, I think that pretty much is it. Yeah. Mm-hmm.
Project Manager: {vocalsound} Okay, then we {disfmarker} I'm looking for three presentations. And uh I don't know whether the order matters much uh, I don't I don't think so, so whoever w wants {disfmarker}
User Interface: Okay, I can start first.
Project Manager: Yeah, okay.
User Interface: Okay. Now my slide, please. {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Okay, your slides. Okay. Oh, come on, close already.
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: And that's number two, right?
User Interface: Three.
Project Manager: Three.
User Interface: Participant three. Yes. Okay.
Project Manager: Okay.
User Interface: Now as an interface designer, I would give more emphasis on the interface, how the remote looks like so that it is sellable, it is attractive to customers. Next, please. Okay. Now the function of a remote is to send messages to the television. This messages could be uh switch on-off message or switch to next channel message or swapping the channels or switching onto a particular channel, like you can have the numbers one, two, three, four, up to nine.
Project Manager: Nine what? Nine channel uh switches?
User Interface: Pardon me?
Project Manager: Nine channel switches? Is {disfmarker} Yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.
User Interface: Yes, nine numbers. And then you have swapping of uh button
Project Manager: Mm-hmm.
User Interface: by which {disfmarker} using which you can swap the channels if you don't want to see the third channel you can swap it to the fourth channel or vice versa. Then it should have a next button, and next button channel by which you can keep on uh v uh mm eh scrolling the channels one by one.
Project Manager: Mm-hmm.
Industrial Designer: Going to the nex next.
Project Manager: Mm-hmm.
User Interface: Next slide, please.
Project Manager: Mm-hmm.
User Interface: Then you should have a button which should which ca which can be used for increasing or decreasing the volume.
Project Manager: Mm-hmm.
User Interface: Then, there should be a button which can give subtitles for a particular program which is going on a television. For example, if you are watching a French program and you would like to have a subtitles in English, then there should be a channel which can trigger this mechanism in the television so that the user can see uh the {gap} the subtitles on the screen.
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Mm-hmm.
User Interface: Then there should d uh there should be some buttons which can control features like the colour, colour of the picture, the contrast, sharpness, brightness of the picture. Now there should be a memory switch. There should be a mute button. Suddenly if if if uh uh viewer he gets a telephone call, and if he want he doesn't want to switch off the uh T_V_, but he he can reduce the sound, he can bring the volume down and he can watch {disfmarker} he can uh {disfmarker} while talking he can watch the T_V_. Now the most important feature I would like to have in my remote would be the speech recognition feature. It's an integrated progra programmable sample sensor speaker unit. So a remote can be th can be uh designed which can have the voice recognisers, you can record your own voice
Project Manager: Mm-hmm.
User Interface: which can be recognised by as voice recogniser in the television, for example, if you want to see {disfmarker} we if you want to see the ninth channel if you say just say ninth channel, uh th now the the {disfmarker} uh yeah, the remote will {disfmarker} automatically it will switch to the ninth channel.
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.
User Interface: So the T_V_ will have some recogniser which will recognise the user's voice and accordingly it will change its functionalities.
Project Manager: Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.
User Interface: So this is one of the very important feature a remote control can have. So this is one one of the interface which can be created.
Project Manager: Mm-hmm.
User Interface: A very simple interface which has all the t uh uh important features.
Project Manager: Mm-hmm.
User Interface: Then, please, next slide.
Project Manager: Mm-hmm.
User Interface: Then, these are some of the remotes which are different in shape and colour, but they have many buttons.
Project Manager: Mm-hmm.
User Interface: So uh sometimes the user finds it very difficult to recognise which button is for what function and all that. So you can you can design an interface which is very simple, and which is user-friendly. Even a kid can use that.
Project Manager: Mm-hmm.
User Interface: So can you go on t t uh to the next slide. Yeah, so this is one of the interface or one of the remote which has this vi voice recogniser.
Project Manager: Mm-hmm.
Marketing: {vocalsound}
User Interface: And this has multi-purpose use, it can be used for T_V_, it can be used for cable-satellite, it can be used for V_C_R_, D_V_D_s and audio. And this has in-built voice recogniser.
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
User Interface: Can you go on to the next slide? Yeah, now this is an interface for a chil uh for a remote uh uh which a child can use.
Project Manager: Mm-hmm.
User Interface: Uh this is user-friendly, it's very attractive and uh children can use it as well as they can play with it. And this comes with different colours, different shapes.
Industrial Designer: Mm.
Project Manager: Mm-hmm.
User Interface: And this this uh child uh interface has minimum buttons
Marketing: {vocalsound}
User Interface: and all the important uh buttons are there in this small, compact, attractive child interface. Next slide, please. Now this is a big over-sized remote which cannot be misplaced or it's impossible to misplace.
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
Marketing: You don't know me.
User Interface: {vocalsound} {gap} {vocalsound} {gap} this. {vocalsound}
Marketing: {vocalsound} I could lose that in a minute. {vocalsound}
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
User Interface: So this is {disfmarker} {vocalsound} No this is a very big, you cannot {vocalsound} misplace it anywhere.
Marketing: {vocalsound}
User Interface: {vocalsound} So this is a jumbo universal remote control and it's impossible to im misplace or lose. {vocalsound}
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Mm-hmm.
User Interface: This i this is one such interface which can be created. {vocalsound} And the personal preference {vocalsound} uh would be a spe uh uh to incorporate speech recognisers uh which will respond to user's voice for a particular uh function.
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Mm-hmm. Right.
User Interface: Thank you, that's {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Mm-hmm. Okay, thank you very much. Uh any comments on uh her presentation?
Marketing: Well, um looks like we still have quite a choice of things out there.
Industrial Designer: Mm-hmm.
Marketing: Um what uh {vocalsound} I'm {disfmarker} No suggestion's bad.
User Interface: Mm yes.
Marketing: But uh we're gonna have to narrow it down a little more. I don't think that we can get uh {disfmarker} The T-shape is good, the child one is good, the too big to misplace, I think it's just funny.
User Interface: Okay. {vocalsound}
Marketing: {vocalsound} Um I don't think that's gonna be our impulse purchase at the checkout counter.
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Yeah, I I th I think {disfmarker}
User Interface: Okay. {gap} {vocalsound}
Marketing: It's it's gonna be a little bit too unwieldy.
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: No, I think the these are her presentations, but uh as far as the decision making we getting to that after after
Marketing: Yeah mm. Mm-hmm. Have to come back to that later. Okay.
User Interface: We can.
Project Manager: but if {disfmarker} I just wanted to know whether anybody had any any anything to add to her presentation.
Marketing: No, I think her presentation was good, and she really explored all the options. Yeah.
Project Manager: Mm right. Mm-hmm. Ho who wants to go next um? Mm-hmm. Okay,
Industrial Designer: Yeah, maybe.
Project Manager: and you {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Participant two.
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Uh okay.
Industrial Designer: Uh the next one, sorry.
Project Manager: Oops.
Industrial Designer: It's it was the old one.
Project Manager: The components design.
Industrial Designer: Components.
Project Manager: Mm-hmm. Okay.
Industrial Designer: Um this time I'm I'm going to um concentrate more on the components and the technical side of the remote controller design.
Marketing: Mm-hmm.
Industrial Designer: Uh, can you go on to the next slide, please.
Project Manager: Mm-hmm.
Industrial Designer: I have just brief {vocalsound} uh down few uh components which we require for the remote control uh construction.
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: Uh the first one is case to keep all the components like integrated circuit, battery, etcetera, etcetera, it's like {disfmarker} Uh it can be a plastic one, hard plastic, so that it can be strong, even if you just uh uh, {vocalsound} you know, if you {vocalsound} {disfmarker} if it falls down, then it doesn't {vocalsound} break. So it should be strong.
Project Manager: Mm-hmm.
Industrial Designer: And uh uh there are no harmful materials used in that. And it should be recyclable.
Project Manager: Mm-hmm.
Industrial Designer: Uh and uh {vocalsound},
Marketing: Mm-hmm. Good point.
Industrial Designer: yeah, and also uh using of colouring compon components like uh if we want to have different colours, blue, red, green, so uh uh we have to use uh some colouring compone compone components. And uh the second important thing is uh uh uh integrated circuit.
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: Uh which uh we can use a highly sophisticated one because it's like the it's like the heart of the remote controller. If it is not efficient then everything wi is going to be uh like um the lef ess less efficient so it {disfmarker} you should {disfmarker} we should have a highly sophisticated one. And it should be resistant to high as well as uh low temperatures. Suppose if it is thirty-eight degrees outside forty degrees outside, it should it should uh {vocalsound} be able to re uh resist the uh temperature uh uh highs and uh high temperatures and low temperatures. And uh it should be with uh {vocalsound} um {disfmarker} equipped with timer and alarm facility. And the uh other component we should {disfmarker} uh we have in the remote controller is a resistor uh which is like uh uh i it is very very much important for the electricity uh flow through {vocalsound} through through the uh remote controller and uh also a capacitor which is a b which is a m I think it's it's like a battery, capacitor. Can you go on to the next slide, please?
Marketing: Mm-hmm.
Project Manager: Mm-hmm.
Industrial Designer: Uh a diode, a transistor, a resonator, these are all this uh technical uh electri electronic compons uh components which are {disfmarker} which we have to use in a remote controller. A battery uh, I would like to suggest one thing uh if we {disfmarker} uh if we will be able to make a res rechargeable battery then we sh we need not go for a high performance battery, even if it is a low performance battery it ca it can't l it can't charge much.
Marketing: Mm-hmm.
Industrial Designer: It it it's not a high voltage battery. Then also we can {disfmarker} If it is a rechargeable one, then uh people can use it for a long time, so in that way we can cut cut the cost, but w uh uh that we have to make the battery as rechargeable one. And we we have a circuit board uh in a remote controller. Can you go to the next slide, please. And how it works, how the remote controller works.
Project Manager: Go away.
Industrial Designer: Thank you. Uh when you press a button, when you do that, you complete a specific connection that means when you when you press a button there will be a s a small circuit underneath the button, and it will send some signals through the wires,
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: and then uh the chip will send start connection and knows that which button is pressed. Suppose you have pressed channel one button, number one you have pressed, then the uh chip will know that the number one button was pressed.
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: It pros produces a mors morse code line signal specific to that button. Every button, every individual button, has its own morse code. Suppose uh the uh user has pressed butto button one, then it will have a spe the circuit will generate a specific morse code to b {vocalsound} that that button, and the transistor will amplify the signal and send then to the L_E_D_ which translates the signal into infrared light. Like {vocalsound} you have got a signal by pressing a button. That's a d a morse code has been generated by the integrated circuit. Now, that signal, that morse code, has to be amplified by the transistor. That is the use of transist transistor we {disfmarker} which we use in the remote controller. It will amplify the signal and it will send it to the L_E_D_ and which translates the signal into an infra infrared bits. The sensor on the T_V_ can see the infrared light, and seeing the signal seeing the signal re it reacts appropriately, that when it sees the amplified mo morse code signal, then it will uh it will uh know which uh what what action it has to uh do. Then it will do the appropriate action. So uh this is how the remote controller works.
User Interface: It works.
Industrial Designer: Can you go to the next slide, please. Yeah, I have few pictures. When you look at the uh um remote controller uh it's it's {vocalsound} it {disfmarker} this is a normal remote controller. And {gap} to the next slide, please.
Marketing: Mm-hmm.
Industrial Designer: And where we had a a few buttons and all. And uh if you open the remote controller you have this circui circuit board and few electronic components,
Marketing: Mm-hmm.
Industrial Designer: like you can see a chip there which is having eighteen pins,
Project Manager: Mm-hmm.
Marketing: Mm-hmm.
Industrial Designer: and also a capac uh a capacitor, three resistors and also a resonator uh um mm {disfmarker} yeah, and di and a diode transistor.
Project Manager: Mm-hmm.
Industrial Designer: The electronic components {disfmarker} uh all of the electronic components have all those uh things like a chip and d {vocalsound} diode transistors an Yeah, di um can y uh you can see the T_A_ double one eight three five labelled uh chip um.
Project Manager: Mm-hmm.
User Interface: Mm yes.
Project Manager: Mm-hmm.
Marketing: Yes.
Industrial Designer: Uh you can also see the uh uh the green {disfmarker} two green things are uh these are {disfmarker} they are {disfmarker} they are resistors,
User Interface: Mm-hmm.
Industrial Designer: and uh just beside that you can see a transistor, and a uh uh cylinder shape, uh that one is a capacitor. Uh and also there are uh {vocalsound} um resistors {disfmarker} uh sorry, ther there is a diode.
Project Manager: Mm-hmm.
Industrial Designer: Can you go {disfmarker} go on to the next slide.
Project Manager: Mm-hmm.
Industrial Designer: So uh this is the circuit board. The green one is a circuit board. Actually, uh building a circuit bo board is pretty pretty uh easy and also it's a it's a l l inexpensive. Uh it's it costs less than what you print on a paper, because uh {vocalsound} uh when you {disfmarker} when you are building uh some circuits {disfmarker} some um uh circuits and also wires, it's it's better to go for printing, because uh you can build these kind of k circuit boards on a on a bulk and it's just printing, nothing like uh, you know, you don't need to use wires and all.
User Interface: Mm-hmm.
Industrial Designer: It's not exactly wires we are using. It's just printing something on a board.
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: Tha tho those prints will acti act as wires and ci uh circuits. So th that green uh thing is a circuit board, and also you can see uh there are b s like uh um access for buttons, like when you press a button, the circuit under the button will be activated uh th it will it will he get some signals from it and it will uh it will ch its ch se send a signal {disfmarker} signals to the, yeah, um integrated circuit.
User Interface: Transmit.
Industrial Designer: Can you go to the next slide, please. Uh so this is {disfmarker} these are the circuits un underneath the buttons. Uh can you see the black uh, round marks?
Project Manager: Mm-hmm.
Industrial Designer: They they are the circuits.
Marketing: Yes.
Industrial Designer: Next, please. And um like uh we have uh designed uh before we have seen some uh few things like {vocalsound} instead off buttons we have some scrolls. Uh b but a b a push-button requires a simple chip underneath it, but whereas a scroll wheel requires normally a regular chip which is a higher price range. Like for s scrolls we have to go for a sophisticated and and k uh {vocalsound} uh uh full {disfmarker} a complete chip.
Marketing: Okay.
User Interface: Okay.
Industrial Designer: Uh and a as energy source we offer a basic battery, a more ingenious uh hard dynamo, um a kinetic provision of energy, more than what is that you shake casually to provide energy. So that also we can have in a battery, uh or we can use solar sells. Uh.
Marketing: Hmm, that's interesting.
Industrial Designer: Yeah. Uh yeah uh the product can be de delivered into different cases. Uh usually, the cases and card flat {vocalsound} that w we see usually uh d uh a normal remote controller.
User Interface: Okay.
Industrial Designer: Um.
Project Manager: Okay.
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
Project Manager: And you have more pictures. Uh we have five minutes to the end of the meeting.
Industrial Designer: Yeah, maybe d uh I have just one more slide, I think. Um. Like we can have a ma material such as plastic, rubber, wood, titanium, but titanium we can't use. Um and also for electronics we can use a simple and regular um re {vocalsound} or an advanced chip on the print, um also infra it includes the infrared se sender. Um yeah the uh {disfmarker} for the movie just to j develop uh samples and so spe sample speaker. An Yeah, that's it. It's all for me now,
Project Manager: Okay, well thank you.
Industrial Designer: thank you.
Project Manager: Any particular comments by anybody?
Marketing: Uh yeah, on the scroll and the push-button, um ca you can achieve scrolling by repeatedly pushing a button?
Industrial Designer: No, no, no, th the the the scrolling wheels are different, like you can go for a sw switches like buttons or scrolls, uh {vocalsound} which which we used to do before ten ten years before, I think.
Marketing: Mm-hmm.
Industrial Designer: Now, nobody uses that because you need you need a a k sophisticated chip and all.
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: So I think it's better we go for uh um ordinary buttons.
Marketing: Um. We'll just go for push buttons
Industrial Designer: Yeah uh yeah, push-buttons. Yeah.
User Interface: Push-buttons.
Marketing: for {disfmarker} in the interest of cost.
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
Marketing: Okay.
Project Manager: We don't have a lot of time left and we will still have to make a decision, and the marketing expert has to present her her thing.
Marketing: {vocalsound} Okay. Go right to my first {disfmarker} my next slide.
Project Manager: Uh okay.
Marketing: Um alright, my method is uh {disfmarker} I'm interested in what the competition is doing, and wanna see how we can make ourselves different from the competition, so I've really been looking at the press and the ads that are out there for other remote controllers. I s I {vocalsound} spend a lot of time on the internet um surfing around doing the same thing. And then when I'm out um in people's houses or at meetings or anything like that, I try to notice what kind of remote controls people have, and if it's convenient in the conversation I ask about it. And I would encourage you all to do the same. Um and my findings from this is that, you know, small is beautiful. Um people like something that really fits in their hand.
User Interface:'Kay.
Marketing: Simple is beautiful. They don't want to have to squint at small print um, they want buttons whose functions are obvious, and they want um as few buttons as possible, and they don't {vocalsound} care for the mode thing. They want each button to do something. And eye-catching is important. It's gotta look cute, it's gotta look appealing. Go ahead, I'm trying to finish fast for you. Um {vocalsound} and our preference is, as far as I'm concerned, are we got to get to the market before the competition. Ours has to be {disfmarker} look really great and it has to come out before the others, so that we have a leg up on time to sell it and push it before other people get out their Christmas item. And we should develop one or two features we can really dwell on in our ad campaign. If we try to tell people it has too many great features, um the consumer just gets confused and we don't get anywhere. So we've gotta narrow our selection down to {vocalsound} li {vocalsound} two things, I think, that we gonna say are really great about our our our new product. And I've been looking around um at what designs {disfmarker} every year different things are popular. And in my research this year I found out that fruit and vegetable shapes are really popular. And people are tired of hard plastic and hard metal. They are more back into soft feel, spongy feeling things, things with maybe a little cloth on them. So those are things maybe we wanna look at as far as saleability of the item.
User Interface: Mm-hmm.
Project Manager: Okay.
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Uh that concludes the presentation of everyone. And what we really have to decide in this meeting is um the concept of the remote.
Marketing: Mm-hmm.
Project Manager: And uh so what do we think on the concept
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: of the remote? {vocalsound}
Marketing: You wanna try to come back to yours, and limit yours a bit?
Project Manager: Y {vocalsound}
User Interface: Uh yes, I would like to include this feature which is called as voice recogniser.
Project Manager: {vocalsound} Okay. Mm-hmm. {vocalsound}
Marketing: Okay.
Industrial Designer: Mm-hmm.
Marketing: So speech recognition is most important as far as you're concerned?
User Interface: This could be uh one feature which could be sellable.
Industrial Designer: Yeah, but w
Marketing: Yeah h that could that could that could be our star feature.
Project Manager: I think that's {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
Marketing: That that {gap} be really good, yeah, I agree with that.
Project Manager: Mm-hmm.
Industrial Designer: Yeah, but but I what I'm uh very very much doubtful how {vocalsound} how uh far it will work, because a speech recogniser like i it it has its own uh uh problems, issues.
Marketing: Distance problem?
Industrial Designer: Yeah, it's not distance problem it it's recognising a person's voice,
User Interface: Mm-hmm.
Industrial Designer: like maybe different people will be having different voices, so it like it's uh {disfmarker} everything so i
Marketing: Uh.
Project Manager: Well, you you teach {disfmarker} You have to teach uh {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: So to get a good recogni recognising system, it's a costly thing, I think.
Marketing: {vocalsound}
User Interface: No, it's it's, uh yeah, it it's like your recording of uh all uh um a question already, and then you're expecting an answer from th For example, you have a T_V_ system, I'm the user and my family members are the user,
Industrial Designer: Mm-hmm.
User Interface: I will already record uh a question like, uh good morning,
Industrial Designer: Yeah, but {disfmarker} Yeah. Mm-hmm.
User Interface: like around eight o'clock I want to see the news in the television.
Industrial Designer: Mm-hmm.
User Interface: So I'll say just good morning and the T_V_ will switch on. It will recognise my voice and will switch on.
Industrial Designer: Mm-hmm. Yeah.
Project Manager: Okay, before we get too far off here um, the components of the concept is the energy. What kind of energy do we foresee? Battery.
Marketing: I think I think battery,
Project Manager: Battery.
User Interface: Battery.
Marketing: and I think we all agreed on that.
User Interface: Yes.
Marketing: That that's that's gonna be most cost-effective and the best thing.
Industrial Designer: Yeah. Yeah.
Project Manager: Okay then {vocalsound} chip on print.
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
Marketing: Yep.
Project Manager: Okay.
User Interface: Yes.
Project Manager: And the case. And I think we all agree on the case, we wanna have something uh maybe bright, colourful.
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
Marketing: Bright, colourful, trendy trendy design, and strong.
User Interface: And compact.
Industrial Designer: And also strong.
User Interface: Trendy design and compact.
Industrial Designer: Trendy, yeah.
Project Manager: Mm-hmm. Trendy design, compact and strong.
User Interface: Yes.
Marketing: Mm-hmm.
Project Manager: User interface concept, uh {vocalsound} interface type, supplements
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: That will be your area I think, right, Jana.
Industrial Designer: Uh. Um like the switches, like we use buttons for user interface.
User Interface: Push-buttons.
Project Manager: Put uh k I guess uh for {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Push-buttons.
Project Manager: yeah. And {vocalsound} Not sure what they mean by supplements.
User Interface: And {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
User Interface: Supplements like different types of features buttons, like can have a f mute button or a swapping button.
Marketing: {vocalsound} Well, I think that {disfmarker} Yeah,
Project Manager: Oh, like {disfmarker}
Marketing: or {vocalsound} or like her speech recognition would also be a supplement.
Project Manager: Oh. A what?
Marketing: Her speech recognition feature would be a supplement.
Project Manager: Right, right, right, mm-hmm.
User Interface: Recogniser. Yes.
Industrial Designer: Mm yeah.
Marketing: Okay, so why don't we put down speech recognition if possible pending some more research from our industrial engineer on how expensive that is.
Industrial Designer: Hmm. Mm-hmm.
Project Manager: Right.
User Interface: Yes.
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
Project Manager: Okay. Uh our next meeting will be in thirty minutes, and the uh I_D_ is to {disfmarker} this is the individual actions to be taken until then, to have the look and feel design, and uh the U_I_D_ is supposed to {vocalsound} uh come up with the user interface design,
Industrial Designer: Mm-hmm.
Project Manager: and the marketing expert with the product evaluation.
Marketing: {vocalsound} Okay.
Project Manager: In this phase, the two of you, Jana and Francine, have to work together on a prototype using modelling clay, it says here.
User Interface: Okay.
Marketing: {vocalsound} {vocalsound}
Project Manager: {vocalsound} You will receive specific {vocalsound} instructions {vocalsound} will be sent to you by your coaches.
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: Mm-hmm.
User Interface: Okay.
Project Manager: Um if you have any questions, you know, you you can always uh contact me um or uh or your coach, I suppose. {vocalsound}
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Marketing: {vocalsound} Wherever they're hiding? {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Um {vocalsound} so um I think we conclude the meeting here and we come back in uh uh thirty minutes, according to our timetable here.
User Interface: Okay.
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
Project Manager: Thank you very much.
User Interface: Thank you.","The general idea for the remote was that it should be easy to use, attractive and electricity saving. People might lose it a lot and it could be sold by using a slogan. For the technical aspect, the remote should have a chip with an interface that controls it, infrared bulbs, battery, wires, buttons and holder. There should be extra features such as timer, lid buttons, on-off button, channel lock and display clock. The remote could be in different shapes, preferably compact and T-shaped. The material should be of non-allergic nature. The different systems that exist were infrared and radio-waves.",qmsum
"What did Industrial Designer say about the working design of the remote during the discussion of the component design?
Project Manager: Okay. Hello everyone. {vocalsound} {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: Hi.
User Interface: Hi.
Marketing: Hi.
Project Manager: Um how uh how we doing?
Industrial Designer: Yeah, good.
Project Manager: Uh first we going uh over the minutes of the last meeting, more or less.
User Interface: Mm-hmm.
Project Manager: Um in the last meeting uh the marketing manager had presented uh her method of working, meaning gathering i suggestions from everyone to see how she best could market uh this this product at the {disfmarker} within the budget uh that was given. Uh in general {vocalsound} the idea is that it should be something that is not difficult to use. Um it's also an item that people lose a lot. So we should address that. And, of course, it should be something s s that is very simple to use. In addition to that to make it sell, of course, uh the marketing manager w wishes that it be very attractive,
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: or like she says put some sizzle into it in one way or another so that the people are buying it now because, in particular with smaller items, that's a very important fact,'cause um if they say, well, I go home and think about it, that won't work. Um also mentioned was it should be uh {disfmarker} it should have a very short learning curve. And maybe it could be sold by using a slogan.
Industrial Designer: Hmm.
Project Manager: {vocalsound} Our technical manager has then said that she feels it should have a chip
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: that has infra-red bits and it has an interface controls w interface that controls the chip. Therefore, messages uh will be controlled in the same manner. There should be extra features like lid buttons, maybe a beep. If too many buttons are pressed, mm uh uh child lock um and uh maybe a display clock so that people could um {disfmarker} you could see the time, you know, what show they want to watch. Also mentioned was uh maybe different shapes. So the components of the thing should be button, bulbs, infra infra-red bulbs, battery, chips, wires, and maybe some kind of a holder uh for the for the uh item. Francino who is our um
User Interface: Interface designer.
Project Manager: interface designer um uh has mentioned that the {disfmarker} that it, of course, should have an on-off button, and also has mentioned an interesting feature that it should have maybe a channel lock. Particularly with maybe small children that they couldn't uh watch a channel that is undesirable. It should be compact. Her personal favourite was it should be T-shaped. And maybe have an anar alarm-clock. And the material should possibly be not of non-allergic nature. Uh the different systems uh that exist are infra-red or radio-waves. Uh maybe it should have uh electri electrici electricity saving feature.
Marketing: {vocalsound} {vocalsound}
Project Manager: And {vocalsound} even possibly a timer to {disfmarker} so that people can program {vocalsound} their favourite uh uh program on th right from the remote.
User Interface: Yes.
Project Manager: Uh are we all in agreement that that's about what we discussed last time? Okay.
User Interface: Yes.
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
Marketing: Yeah, I think that pretty much is it. Yeah. Mm-hmm.
Project Manager: {vocalsound} Okay, then we {disfmarker} I'm looking for three presentations. And uh I don't know whether the order matters much uh, I don't I don't think so, so whoever w wants {disfmarker}
User Interface: Okay, I can start first.
Project Manager: Yeah, okay.
User Interface: Okay. Now my slide, please. {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Okay, your slides. Okay. Oh, come on, close already.
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: And that's number two, right?
User Interface: Three.
Project Manager: Three.
User Interface: Participant three. Yes. Okay.
Project Manager: Okay.
User Interface: Now as an interface designer, I would give more emphasis on the interface, how the remote looks like so that it is sellable, it is attractive to customers. Next, please. Okay. Now the function of a remote is to send messages to the television. This messages could be uh switch on-off message or switch to next channel message or swapping the channels or switching onto a particular channel, like you can have the numbers one, two, three, four, up to nine.
Project Manager: Nine what? Nine channel uh switches?
User Interface: Pardon me?
Project Manager: Nine channel switches? Is {disfmarker} Yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.
User Interface: Yes, nine numbers. And then you have swapping of uh button
Project Manager: Mm-hmm.
User Interface: by which {disfmarker} using which you can swap the channels if you don't want to see the third channel you can swap it to the fourth channel or vice versa. Then it should have a next button, and next button channel by which you can keep on uh v uh mm eh scrolling the channels one by one.
Project Manager: Mm-hmm.
Industrial Designer: Going to the nex next.
Project Manager: Mm-hmm.
User Interface: Next slide, please.
Project Manager: Mm-hmm.
User Interface: Then you should have a button which should which ca which can be used for increasing or decreasing the volume.
Project Manager: Mm-hmm.
User Interface: Then, there should be a button which can give subtitles for a particular program which is going on a television. For example, if you are watching a French program and you would like to have a subtitles in English, then there should be a channel which can trigger this mechanism in the television so that the user can see uh the {gap} the subtitles on the screen.
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Mm-hmm.
User Interface: Then there should d uh there should be some buttons which can control features like the colour, colour of the picture, the contrast, sharpness, brightness of the picture. Now there should be a memory switch. There should be a mute button. Suddenly if if if uh uh viewer he gets a telephone call, and if he want he doesn't want to switch off the uh T_V_, but he he can reduce the sound, he can bring the volume down and he can watch {disfmarker} he can uh {disfmarker} while talking he can watch the T_V_. Now the most important feature I would like to have in my remote would be the speech recognition feature. It's an integrated progra programmable sample sensor speaker unit. So a remote can be th can be uh designed which can have the voice recognisers, you can record your own voice
Project Manager: Mm-hmm.
User Interface: which can be recognised by as voice recogniser in the television, for example, if you want to see {disfmarker} we if you want to see the ninth channel if you say just say ninth channel, uh th now the the {disfmarker} uh yeah, the remote will {disfmarker} automatically it will switch to the ninth channel.
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.
User Interface: So the T_V_ will have some recogniser which will recognise the user's voice and accordingly it will change its functionalities.
Project Manager: Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.
User Interface: So this is one of the very important feature a remote control can have. So this is one one of the interface which can be created.
Project Manager: Mm-hmm.
User Interface: A very simple interface which has all the t uh uh important features.
Project Manager: Mm-hmm.
User Interface: Then, please, next slide.
Project Manager: Mm-hmm.
User Interface: Then, these are some of the remotes which are different in shape and colour, but they have many buttons.
Project Manager: Mm-hmm.
User Interface: So uh sometimes the user finds it very difficult to recognise which button is for what function and all that. So you can you can design an interface which is very simple, and which is user-friendly. Even a kid can use that.
Project Manager: Mm-hmm.
User Interface: So can you go on t t uh to the next slide. Yeah, so this is one of the interface or one of the remote which has this vi voice recogniser.
Project Manager: Mm-hmm.
Marketing: {vocalsound}
User Interface: And this has multi-purpose use, it can be used for T_V_, it can be used for cable-satellite, it can be used for V_C_R_, D_V_D_s and audio. And this has in-built voice recogniser.
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
User Interface: Can you go on to the next slide? Yeah, now this is an interface for a chil uh for a remote uh uh which a child can use.
Project Manager: Mm-hmm.
User Interface: Uh this is user-friendly, it's very attractive and uh children can use it as well as they can play with it. And this comes with different colours, different shapes.
Industrial Designer: Mm.
Project Manager: Mm-hmm.
User Interface: And this this uh child uh interface has minimum buttons
Marketing: {vocalsound}
User Interface: and all the important uh buttons are there in this small, compact, attractive child interface. Next slide, please. Now this is a big over-sized remote which cannot be misplaced or it's impossible to misplace.
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
Marketing: You don't know me.
User Interface: {vocalsound} {gap} {vocalsound} {gap} this. {vocalsound}
Marketing: {vocalsound} I could lose that in a minute. {vocalsound}
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
User Interface: So this is {disfmarker} {vocalsound} No this is a very big, you cannot {vocalsound} misplace it anywhere.
Marketing: {vocalsound}
User Interface: {vocalsound} So this is a jumbo universal remote control and it's impossible to im misplace or lose. {vocalsound}
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Mm-hmm.
User Interface: This i this is one such interface which can be created. {vocalsound} And the personal preference {vocalsound} uh would be a spe uh uh to incorporate speech recognisers uh which will respond to user's voice for a particular uh function.
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Mm-hmm. Right.
User Interface: Thank you, that's {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Mm-hmm. Okay, thank you very much. Uh any comments on uh her presentation?
Marketing: Well, um looks like we still have quite a choice of things out there.
Industrial Designer: Mm-hmm.
Marketing: Um what uh {vocalsound} I'm {disfmarker} No suggestion's bad.
User Interface: Mm yes.
Marketing: But uh we're gonna have to narrow it down a little more. I don't think that we can get uh {disfmarker} The T-shape is good, the child one is good, the too big to misplace, I think it's just funny.
User Interface: Okay. {vocalsound}
Marketing: {vocalsound} Um I don't think that's gonna be our impulse purchase at the checkout counter.
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Yeah, I I th I think {disfmarker}
User Interface: Okay. {gap} {vocalsound}
Marketing: It's it's gonna be a little bit too unwieldy.
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: No, I think the these are her presentations, but uh as far as the decision making we getting to that after after
Marketing: Yeah mm. Mm-hmm. Have to come back to that later. Okay.
User Interface: We can.
Project Manager: but if {disfmarker} I just wanted to know whether anybody had any any anything to add to her presentation.
Marketing: No, I think her presentation was good, and she really explored all the options. Yeah.
Project Manager: Mm right. Mm-hmm. Ho who wants to go next um? Mm-hmm. Okay,
Industrial Designer: Yeah, maybe.
Project Manager: and you {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Participant two.
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Uh okay.
Industrial Designer: Uh the next one, sorry.
Project Manager: Oops.
Industrial Designer: It's it was the old one.
Project Manager: The components design.
Industrial Designer: Components.
Project Manager: Mm-hmm. Okay.
Industrial Designer: Um this time I'm I'm going to um concentrate more on the components and the technical side of the remote controller design.
Marketing: Mm-hmm.
Industrial Designer: Uh, can you go on to the next slide, please.
Project Manager: Mm-hmm.
Industrial Designer: I have just brief {vocalsound} uh down few uh components which we require for the remote control uh construction.
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: Uh the first one is case to keep all the components like integrated circuit, battery, etcetera, etcetera, it's like {disfmarker} Uh it can be a plastic one, hard plastic, so that it can be strong, even if you just uh uh, {vocalsound} you know, if you {vocalsound} {disfmarker} if it falls down, then it doesn't {vocalsound} break. So it should be strong.
Project Manager: Mm-hmm.
Industrial Designer: And uh uh there are no harmful materials used in that. And it should be recyclable.
Project Manager: Mm-hmm.
Industrial Designer: Uh and uh {vocalsound},
Marketing: Mm-hmm. Good point.
Industrial Designer: yeah, and also uh using of colouring compon components like uh if we want to have different colours, blue, red, green, so uh uh we have to use uh some colouring compone compone components. And uh the second important thing is uh uh uh integrated circuit.
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: Uh which uh we can use a highly sophisticated one because it's like the it's like the heart of the remote controller. If it is not efficient then everything wi is going to be uh like um the lef ess less efficient so it {disfmarker} you should {disfmarker} we should have a highly sophisticated one. And it should be resistant to high as well as uh low temperatures. Suppose if it is thirty-eight degrees outside forty degrees outside, it should it should uh {vocalsound} be able to re uh resist the uh temperature uh uh highs and uh high temperatures and low temperatures. And uh it should be with uh {vocalsound} um {disfmarker} equipped with timer and alarm facility. And the uh other component we should {disfmarker} uh we have in the remote controller is a resistor uh which is like uh uh i it is very very much important for the electricity uh flow through {vocalsound} through through the uh remote controller and uh also a capacitor which is a b which is a m I think it's it's like a battery, capacitor. Can you go on to the next slide, please?
Marketing: Mm-hmm.
Project Manager: Mm-hmm.
Industrial Designer: Uh a diode, a transistor, a resonator, these are all this uh technical uh electri electronic compons uh components which are {disfmarker} which we have to use in a remote controller. A battery uh, I would like to suggest one thing uh if we {disfmarker} uh if we will be able to make a res rechargeable battery then we sh we need not go for a high performance battery, even if it is a low performance battery it ca it can't l it can't charge much.
Marketing: Mm-hmm.
Industrial Designer: It it it's not a high voltage battery. Then also we can {disfmarker} If it is a rechargeable one, then uh people can use it for a long time, so in that way we can cut cut the cost, but w uh uh that we have to make the battery as rechargeable one. And we we have a circuit board uh in a remote controller. Can you go to the next slide, please. And how it works, how the remote controller works.
Project Manager: Go away.
Industrial Designer: Thank you. Uh when you press a button, when you do that, you complete a specific connection that means when you when you press a button there will be a s a small circuit underneath the button, and it will send some signals through the wires,
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: and then uh the chip will send start connection and knows that which button is pressed. Suppose you have pressed channel one button, number one you have pressed, then the uh chip will know that the number one button was pressed.
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: It pros produces a mors morse code line signal specific to that button. Every button, every individual button, has its own morse code. Suppose uh the uh user has pressed butto button one, then it will have a spe the circuit will generate a specific morse code to b {vocalsound} that that button, and the transistor will amplify the signal and send then to the L_E_D_ which translates the signal into infrared light. Like {vocalsound} you have got a signal by pressing a button. That's a d a morse code has been generated by the integrated circuit. Now, that signal, that morse code, has to be amplified by the transistor. That is the use of transist transistor we {disfmarker} which we use in the remote controller. It will amplify the signal and it will send it to the L_E_D_ and which translates the signal into an infra infrared bits. The sensor on the T_V_ can see the infrared light, and seeing the signal seeing the signal re it reacts appropriately, that when it sees the amplified mo morse code signal, then it will uh it will uh know which uh what what action it has to uh do. Then it will do the appropriate action. So uh this is how the remote controller works.
User Interface: It works.
Industrial Designer: Can you go to the next slide, please. Yeah, I have few pictures. When you look at the uh um remote controller uh it's it's {vocalsound} it {disfmarker} this is a normal remote controller. And {gap} to the next slide, please.
Marketing: Mm-hmm.
Industrial Designer: And where we had a a few buttons and all. And uh if you open the remote controller you have this circui circuit board and few electronic components,
Marketing: Mm-hmm.
Industrial Designer: like you can see a chip there which is having eighteen pins,
Project Manager: Mm-hmm.
Marketing: Mm-hmm.
Industrial Designer: and also a capac uh a capacitor, three resistors and also a resonator uh um mm {disfmarker} yeah, and di and a diode transistor.
Project Manager: Mm-hmm.
Industrial Designer: The electronic components {disfmarker} uh all of the electronic components have all those uh things like a chip and d {vocalsound} diode transistors an Yeah, di um can y uh you can see the T_A_ double one eight three five labelled uh chip um.
Project Manager: Mm-hmm.
User Interface: Mm yes.
Project Manager: Mm-hmm.
Marketing: Yes.
Industrial Designer: Uh you can also see the uh uh the green {disfmarker} two green things are uh these are {disfmarker} they are {disfmarker} they are resistors,
User Interface: Mm-hmm.
Industrial Designer: and uh just beside that you can see a transistor, and a uh uh cylinder shape, uh that one is a capacitor. Uh and also there are uh {vocalsound} um resistors {disfmarker} uh sorry, ther there is a diode.
Project Manager: Mm-hmm.
Industrial Designer: Can you go {disfmarker} go on to the next slide.
Project Manager: Mm-hmm.
Industrial Designer: So uh this is the circuit board. The green one is a circuit board. Actually, uh building a circuit bo board is pretty pretty uh easy and also it's a it's a l l inexpensive. Uh it's it costs less than what you print on a paper, because uh {vocalsound} uh when you {disfmarker} when you are building uh some circuits {disfmarker} some um uh circuits and also wires, it's it's better to go for printing, because uh you can build these kind of k circuit boards on a on a bulk and it's just printing, nothing like uh, you know, you don't need to use wires and all.
User Interface: Mm-hmm.
Industrial Designer: It's not exactly wires we are using. It's just printing something on a board.
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: Tha tho those prints will acti act as wires and ci uh circuits. So th that green uh thing is a circuit board, and also you can see uh there are b s like uh um access for buttons, like when you press a button, the circuit under the button will be activated uh th it will it will he get some signals from it and it will uh it will ch its ch se send a signal {disfmarker} signals to the, yeah, um integrated circuit.
User Interface: Transmit.
Industrial Designer: Can you go to the next slide, please. Uh so this is {disfmarker} these are the circuits un underneath the buttons. Uh can you see the black uh, round marks?
Project Manager: Mm-hmm.
Industrial Designer: They they are the circuits.
Marketing: Yes.
Industrial Designer: Next, please. And um like uh we have uh designed uh before we have seen some uh few things like {vocalsound} instead off buttons we have some scrolls. Uh b but a b a push-button requires a simple chip underneath it, but whereas a scroll wheel requires normally a regular chip which is a higher price range. Like for s scrolls we have to go for a sophisticated and and k uh {vocalsound} uh uh full {disfmarker} a complete chip.
Marketing: Okay.
User Interface: Okay.
Industrial Designer: Uh and a as energy source we offer a basic battery, a more ingenious uh hard dynamo, um a kinetic provision of energy, more than what is that you shake casually to provide energy. So that also we can have in a battery, uh or we can use solar sells. Uh.
Marketing: Hmm, that's interesting.
Industrial Designer: Yeah. Uh yeah uh the product can be de delivered into different cases. Uh usually, the cases and card flat {vocalsound} that w we see usually uh d uh a normal remote controller.
User Interface: Okay.
Industrial Designer: Um.
Project Manager: Okay.
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
Project Manager: And you have more pictures. Uh we have five minutes to the end of the meeting.
Industrial Designer: Yeah, maybe d uh I have just one more slide, I think. Um. Like we can have a ma material such as plastic, rubber, wood, titanium, but titanium we can't use. Um and also for electronics we can use a simple and regular um re {vocalsound} or an advanced chip on the print, um also infra it includes the infrared se sender. Um yeah the uh {disfmarker} for the movie just to j develop uh samples and so spe sample speaker. An Yeah, that's it. It's all for me now,
Project Manager: Okay, well thank you.
Industrial Designer: thank you.
Project Manager: Any particular comments by anybody?
Marketing: Uh yeah, on the scroll and the push-button, um ca you can achieve scrolling by repeatedly pushing a button?
Industrial Designer: No, no, no, th the the the scrolling wheels are different, like you can go for a sw switches like buttons or scrolls, uh {vocalsound} which which we used to do before ten ten years before, I think.
Marketing: Mm-hmm.
Industrial Designer: Now, nobody uses that because you need you need a a k sophisticated chip and all.
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: So I think it's better we go for uh um ordinary buttons.
Marketing: Um. We'll just go for push buttons
Industrial Designer: Yeah uh yeah, push-buttons. Yeah.
User Interface: Push-buttons.
Marketing: for {disfmarker} in the interest of cost.
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
Marketing: Okay.
Project Manager: We don't have a lot of time left and we will still have to make a decision, and the marketing expert has to present her her thing.
Marketing: {vocalsound} Okay. Go right to my first {disfmarker} my next slide.
Project Manager: Uh okay.
Marketing: Um alright, my method is uh {disfmarker} I'm interested in what the competition is doing, and wanna see how we can make ourselves different from the competition, so I've really been looking at the press and the ads that are out there for other remote controllers. I s I {vocalsound} spend a lot of time on the internet um surfing around doing the same thing. And then when I'm out um in people's houses or at meetings or anything like that, I try to notice what kind of remote controls people have, and if it's convenient in the conversation I ask about it. And I would encourage you all to do the same. Um and my findings from this is that, you know, small is beautiful. Um people like something that really fits in their hand.
User Interface:'Kay.
Marketing: Simple is beautiful. They don't want to have to squint at small print um, they want buttons whose functions are obvious, and they want um as few buttons as possible, and they don't {vocalsound} care for the mode thing. They want each button to do something. And eye-catching is important. It's gotta look cute, it's gotta look appealing. Go ahead, I'm trying to finish fast for you. Um {vocalsound} and our preference is, as far as I'm concerned, are we got to get to the market before the competition. Ours has to be {disfmarker} look really great and it has to come out before the others, so that we have a leg up on time to sell it and push it before other people get out their Christmas item. And we should develop one or two features we can really dwell on in our ad campaign. If we try to tell people it has too many great features, um the consumer just gets confused and we don't get anywhere. So we've gotta narrow our selection down to {vocalsound} li {vocalsound} two things, I think, that we gonna say are really great about our our our new product. And I've been looking around um at what designs {disfmarker} every year different things are popular. And in my research this year I found out that fruit and vegetable shapes are really popular. And people are tired of hard plastic and hard metal. They are more back into soft feel, spongy feeling things, things with maybe a little cloth on them. So those are things maybe we wanna look at as far as saleability of the item.
User Interface: Mm-hmm.
Project Manager: Okay.
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Uh that concludes the presentation of everyone. And what we really have to decide in this meeting is um the concept of the remote.
Marketing: Mm-hmm.
Project Manager: And uh so what do we think on the concept
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: of the remote? {vocalsound}
Marketing: You wanna try to come back to yours, and limit yours a bit?
Project Manager: Y {vocalsound}
User Interface: Uh yes, I would like to include this feature which is called as voice recogniser.
Project Manager: {vocalsound} Okay. Mm-hmm. {vocalsound}
Marketing: Okay.
Industrial Designer: Mm-hmm.
Marketing: So speech recognition is most important as far as you're concerned?
User Interface: This could be uh one feature which could be sellable.
Industrial Designer: Yeah, but w
Marketing: Yeah h that could that could that could be our star feature.
Project Manager: I think that's {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
Marketing: That that {gap} be really good, yeah, I agree with that.
Project Manager: Mm-hmm.
Industrial Designer: Yeah, but but I what I'm uh very very much doubtful how {vocalsound} how uh far it will work, because a speech recogniser like i it it has its own uh uh problems, issues.
Marketing: Distance problem?
Industrial Designer: Yeah, it's not distance problem it it's recognising a person's voice,
User Interface: Mm-hmm.
Industrial Designer: like maybe different people will be having different voices, so it like it's uh {disfmarker} everything so i
Marketing: Uh.
Project Manager: Well, you you teach {disfmarker} You have to teach uh {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: So to get a good recogni recognising system, it's a costly thing, I think.
Marketing: {vocalsound}
User Interface: No, it's it's, uh yeah, it it's like your recording of uh all uh um a question already, and then you're expecting an answer from th For example, you have a T_V_ system, I'm the user and my family members are the user,
Industrial Designer: Mm-hmm.
User Interface: I will already record uh a question like, uh good morning,
Industrial Designer: Yeah, but {disfmarker} Yeah. Mm-hmm.
User Interface: like around eight o'clock I want to see the news in the television.
Industrial Designer: Mm-hmm.
User Interface: So I'll say just good morning and the T_V_ will switch on. It will recognise my voice and will switch on.
Industrial Designer: Mm-hmm. Yeah.
Project Manager: Okay, before we get too far off here um, the components of the concept is the energy. What kind of energy do we foresee? Battery.
Marketing: I think I think battery,
Project Manager: Battery.
User Interface: Battery.
Marketing: and I think we all agreed on that.
User Interface: Yes.
Marketing: That that's that's gonna be most cost-effective and the best thing.
Industrial Designer: Yeah. Yeah.
Project Manager: Okay then {vocalsound} chip on print.
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
Marketing: Yep.
Project Manager: Okay.
User Interface: Yes.
Project Manager: And the case. And I think we all agree on the case, we wanna have something uh maybe bright, colourful.
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
Marketing: Bright, colourful, trendy trendy design, and strong.
User Interface: And compact.
Industrial Designer: And also strong.
User Interface: Trendy design and compact.
Industrial Designer: Trendy, yeah.
Project Manager: Mm-hmm. Trendy design, compact and strong.
User Interface: Yes.
Marketing: Mm-hmm.
Project Manager: User interface concept, uh {vocalsound} interface type, supplements
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: That will be your area I think, right, Jana.
Industrial Designer: Uh. Um like the switches, like we use buttons for user interface.
User Interface: Push-buttons.
Project Manager: Put uh k I guess uh for {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Push-buttons.
Project Manager: yeah. And {vocalsound} Not sure what they mean by supplements.
User Interface: And {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
User Interface: Supplements like different types of features buttons, like can have a f mute button or a swapping button.
Marketing: {vocalsound} Well, I think that {disfmarker} Yeah,
Project Manager: Oh, like {disfmarker}
Marketing: or {vocalsound} or like her speech recognition would also be a supplement.
Project Manager: Oh. A what?
Marketing: Her speech recognition feature would be a supplement.
Project Manager: Right, right, right, mm-hmm.
User Interface: Recogniser. Yes.
Industrial Designer: Mm yeah.
Marketing: Okay, so why don't we put down speech recognition if possible pending some more research from our industrial engineer on how expensive that is.
Industrial Designer: Hmm. Mm-hmm.
Project Manager: Right.
User Interface: Yes.
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
Project Manager: Okay. Uh our next meeting will be in thirty minutes, and the uh I_D_ is to {disfmarker} this is the individual actions to be taken until then, to have the look and feel design, and uh the U_I_D_ is supposed to {vocalsound} uh come up with the user interface design,
Industrial Designer: Mm-hmm.
Project Manager: and the marketing expert with the product evaluation.
Marketing: {vocalsound} Okay.
Project Manager: In this phase, the two of you, Jana and Francine, have to work together on a prototype using modelling clay, it says here.
User Interface: Okay.
Marketing: {vocalsound} {vocalsound}
Project Manager: {vocalsound} You will receive specific {vocalsound} instructions {vocalsound} will be sent to you by your coaches.
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: Mm-hmm.
User Interface: Okay.
Project Manager: Um if you have any questions, you know, you you can always uh contact me um or uh or your coach, I suppose. {vocalsound}
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Marketing: {vocalsound} Wherever they're hiding? {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Um {vocalsound} so um I think we conclude the meeting here and we come back in uh uh thirty minutes, according to our timetable here.
User Interface: Okay.
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
Project Manager: Thank you very much.
User Interface: Thank you.","When a button was pressed, a small circuit underneath the button would send signals through the wires to the chip. The chip would know which button was pressed and produce a morse code signal specific to that button, which the transistor would amplify the signal. The LED would receive the signal and translate it into infrared light. The sensor on the TV would receive the infrared light which contained the signals and would react accordingly.",qmsum
"What did the team eventually come up with to reduce costs?
User Interface: Okay.
Industrial Designer: Okay, almost there.
Project Manager: Okay. We'll sta I'll use the PowerPoint, I guess. How was that, was that fun?
User Interface: Mm. Very fun.
Industrial Designer: Yeah, yeah.
Project Manager: {vocalsound} Okay. Uh oh I've forgotten to mail you the minutes, but I will do.
Industrial Designer: Okay.
Marketing: Hmm.
Project Manager: {vocalsound} Upsidaisy. {vocalsound} Um {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Um we {disfmarker}
Marketing: E excuse me I forgot my
Project Manager: Yeah.
Marketing: copy. {gap}
Project Manager: Alright, okay, yeah.
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: He's gonna get his pen.
User Interface: Oh right. Okay.
Project Manager: Um {vocalsound} Will you guys first with your prototype um before we get to the good news?
Industrial Designer: Yeah, there's good news?
Project Manager: Uh {vocalsound} {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: Oh.
User Interface: Mm.
Project Manager: we have budget problems.
Industrial Designer: Oh. Cutbacks.
Project Manager: I'm afraid you're all sacked. Oops.
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: I don't even have this on. {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: Hmm.
Project Manager: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Okay, have you got a presentation to make?
Industrial Designer: Okay.
Marketing: No, not mine yet.
Project Manager: No. Okay
Industrial Designer: Oh.
Project Manager: so it's just your your show.
Industrial Designer: Um maybe we should bring {gap} so that the camera can see {gap}. Yeah.
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
User Interface: Okay. Sure.
Industrial Designer: Okay.
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
User Interface: We made three for you.
Project Manager: Three? Oh.
User Interface: Um one's based on the banana, one's based on the tomato
Project Manager: Tomato? What tomato? {vocalsound}
User Interface: and the other one is st
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: I don't recall a tomato. {vocalsound}
User Interface: Look. Oh yeah, well yeah, we had v some red left over.
Project Manager: Ah I see, okay. {vocalsound}
User Interface: So. Okay, so this is the um non to non uh no buttons one, or as mm few buttons as possible,
Project Manager: Mm-hmm.
User Interface: mainly speak recognition. The yellow there is the um
Project Manager: Logo.
User Interface: the slogan, yeah,
Project Manager: Okay, brilliant.
User Interface: that we need to incorporate, it's very simple. If you do need buttons, you can flip it over, and there's some there,
Project Manager: Okay.
User Interface: um but mainly it's speech recognition.
Project Manager: Okay, so the buttons would be like, you know individual users, or {disfmarker}
User Interface: Yeah.
Project Manager: Yeah.
User Interface: Yeah and {vocalsound} yeah they might project things onto the screen which you can do on there.
Project Manager: Alright, okay.
User Interface: Mm I'm not sure about that. Um and this one is the one w more like the one w that we looked at earlier.
Project Manager: Right.
User Interface: {vocalsound} Yeah, you guys can have a look at that if you want.
Project Manager: That's groovy. {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: {gap}
Marketing: Yeah. {vocalsound} Uh can I have {gap}
Project Manager: {vocalsound} Well I like the feel of it, I like the feel of it.
User Interface: Yeah, sure. Um that one is {disfmarker}
Marketing: Oh sorry s {vocalsound}
User Interface: Oh no, it's delicate.
Project Manager: At Oh dear.
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Marketing: {vocalsound}
User Interface: That's that's already got its stand that one. That's it stand.
Project Manager: Alright, okay.
User Interface: It does also lie flat, but that's the that yellow stand there represents the the charging stand.
Project Manager: Okay, brilliant mm.
User Interface: Um the black on the back is the slogan.
Project Manager: Okay, nice and obvious there {vocalsound},
User Interface: Uh yeah, that {gap} {disfmarker}
Marketing: {vocalsound}
User Interface: Well, we did think of that.
Project Manager: if it's standing up, I guess, yeah.
User Interface: Yeah, if it's standing up it's it's on there, but also we're gonna have the company name on the front, which is the little black kind of line in the middle.
Project Manager: Oh right, okay, brilliant. Like that from its centre.
User Interface: So um and that's the um transmit the L_E_D_ thing. These are the s two scroll ones which we thought could be channel up and down and volume up and down. We n were weren't sure about putting them there, because um i it's it kind of could get bashed.
Project Manager: Where you're, yeah, uh were you're holding it kind of {disfmarker}
User Interface: Yeah. Well, if you hold it, you can {disfmarker} you all can hold it, is {disfmarker} it does actually feel quite ergonomic,
Project Manager: Mm-hmm.
User Interface: if you've got small hands.
Project Manager: Yeah. {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: Mm.
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Okay.
User Interface: {vocalsound} Um, obviously I don't think that's real sized {gap}.
Project Manager: Yeah, okay.
User Interface: It would have to be a bit bigger.
Project Manager: Yeah, scale model, yeah.
User Interface: Okay. Um that's a speaker at the top, so you can speak into it like a little walkie-talkie as well for speak recognition.
Project Manager: Mm-hmm.
User Interface: Um and {vocalsound} um then the buttons. Yeah kind of self-explanatory, just buttons whenever you need them. Tried to keep it simple. Oh that's the charging base prongs at the bottom.
Project Manager: {vocalsound} Alright, excellent.
User Interface: {vocalsound} We used those {gap}. And um then the big red button in the middle is the on and off one.
Project Manager: Okay.
User Interface: It's not in the traditional place,
Project Manager: No.
User Interface: but um it's quite an obvious place.
Project Manager: It's out of the way as well, I suppose, so. Excellent.
User Interface: So {vocalsound} there we go and and um we have the banana-based one too.
Industrial Designer: Oh yeah, yeah.
Project Manager: Yep. {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: This one is uh, I suppose for the younger audiences.
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: A a more friendly type of {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Okay, {vocalsound} so so Barney the banana {gap}.
Industrial Designer: Right, right. It's to uh induce more television watching I suppose or {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Ah excellent, just what we need.
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
User Interface: Yeah.
Industrial Designer: Say it for the camera.
Project Manager: {vocalsound} Lo Sort of Loch Ness banana. {vocalsound}
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Marketing: Mm-hmm.
User Interface: Mm-hmm.
Industrial Designer: Right, right.
Project Manager: Cool {gap} yeah. Well, nice to have uh options at least.
Industrial Designer: Yep. {vocalsound}
User Interface: Yeah.
Project Manager:'Kay and {disfmarker}
User Interface: {vocalsound} So are there any um improvements or issues or {disfmarker} {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: It won't stand.
Project Manager: Oh there are issues, oh there are issues.
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} Just let it lie down, it wont stand. {vocalsound}
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Um main problem that we have unfortunately being finance.
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
User Interface: Oh.
Project Manager: Uh, let's just enter in the um evaluation criteria.
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Um {vocalsound} unfortunately the unit we are currently going to produce minus the extra scroll buttons, uh it's gonna cost us fourteen point six Euros.
Marketing: Mm.
User Interface: Oh.
Project Manager: So we have to
Industrial Designer: What's on the uh on the left? {gap}
Project Manager: rea Sorry, I've accidentally highlighted somehow {disfmarker} Um. {vocalsound} There we go.
Industrial Designer: Okay.
Project Manager: Oh god, why is it doing that?
User Interface: Ooh.
Project Manager: There we go. {vocalsound} So basically, um in order to save our two Euros um I was thinking that we could have essentially the same shape, but just have it flattened.
User Interface: Mm-hmm.
Project Manager: Um.
User Interface: More like a traditional remote control.
Project Manager: Yeah, I mean it's already got a kind of cool shape, so but it wouldn't have to be curved sort of in and out.
User Interface: Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.
Project Manager: And by doing so {disfmarker} Oh no, hold on. Doesn't save us quite as much. I don't know what's going on with this again.
Industrial Designer: W why is the uh double curved two of them?
Project Manager: Oh, good point.
Marketing: And double curve on both sides?
Project Manager: Um.
Marketing: Curve {vocalsound}. Yeah, this is double-curve,
Project Manager: That's {vocalsound} sort of curve in and out.
Marketing: no?
Industrial Designer: Is i
Marketing: This is double-curve. It {disfmarker} This one is single curve.
Industrial Designer: Mm.
Marketing:'Cause this is single curve, this is curved on both sides. So double-curve.
Project Manager: No, I think it means double curved as in um
User Interface: Like an S_ shape.
Project Manager: like uh {gap} a single curve on that bottom half, and the double curved would be if it was that similar curve upward.
User Interface: Okay.
Project Manager: Okay, I might be wrong though.
Marketing: Like this, one curve on this side, one curve on that side.
Project Manager: I don't think that counts as a curve, I think that's just a shape.
Marketing: Hmm. Hmm.
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: A curvature is like the {disfmarker} this case.
User Interface: Okay.
Marketing: Maybe.
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}'Cause that's the uh the biggest expense there, right.
User Interface: Okay.
Industrial Designer: {gap} got two of them {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Yeah, and why why I've got it two, I don't know, I can't seem to select any more however.
Industrial Designer: Okay. Well we can work around that um {disfmarker} {vocalsound}
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
User Interface: Mm-hmm.
Project Manager: Right. No.
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} Cut things out. But you think it should be one.
Project Manager: It's meant to be one, yeah, I don't know why I put two in there,
Industrial Designer: Okay.
Project Manager: but um {disfmarker} Hold on till I find it, I think this shift button might be stuck again. No maybe the shift button's stuck in.
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
Marketing: Mm.
Project Manager: {vocalsound} Um okay, so that would take away three, which would give us {disfmarker}
Marketing: Should {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Oh that's fine.
Industrial Designer: Yeah, so we're {disfmarker} {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Eleven uh eleven Euros sixty.
User Interface: Cool. Cool.
Project Manager: Um {vocalsound}
User Interface: So we could even add something.
Project Manager: We cou Oh not quite, have the scroll-wheel, unfortunately.
Industrial Designer: We should fire the accountants.
Project Manager: What?
Industrial Designer: Fire the accountants. {vocalsound}
Project Manager: {vocalsound} {vocalsound}
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: Ah yeah, we could add things.
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: Maybe if you click back in that bottom right cell, where you're starting from, and then use the arrow keys.
Project Manager: Yeah.
Industrial Designer: Does that work?
Project Manager: Yeah, I know, that just extends it as well.
Industrial Designer: No mm {vocalsound}.
Marketing: Uh you can do one thing {gap}.
Project Manager: I don't know.
Marketing: You just select one box outsi yeah, this box. Then move it with the help of this {disfmarker} Okay.
Project Manager: It {disfmarker} One of the buttons is sticking, I don't know {gap}.
Marketing: {vocalsound} Just uh just uh {disfmarker} Okay, just a minute. Okay. No input, like this. {vocalsound} Shift. No it's not.
Project Manager: No, it's'cause the uh the shift button's stuck, or something.
Marketing: Yeah, it's not working.
Industrial Designer: Is it the other shift button maybe?
Marketing: Should we ask Meli
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
Marketing: Should we ask our technical expert Melissa?
Project Manager: {vocalsound} No that's fine. Um we've worked out what it would be anyway.
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} Did you try both shift buttons? It could be the other side.
Project Manager: Yeah.
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Cancel. Piss off.
Industrial Designer: That's too bad.
Project Manager: Oh well, never mind. Um {vocalsound}. Right, so that's finances and I dunno what we {disfmarker} what could we reckon we could add? Um
User Interface: Well maybe we could add something, but maybe if {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Well I suppose that's our that's that's our design that we've got. So {disfmarker}
User Interface: What do you th We're trying to save money, so. Yeah, if we're happy with the design there's no point in spending money, if we don't have to.
Project Manager: Yeah.
User Interface: But if there is anything you think we've missed out there, then, you know, feel free to add it. Maybe {disfmarker} I mean obviously it would be bigger so there might be more space for the the slogan on the front,
Project Manager: Yeah yeah.
User Interface: because it's not in an ideal place right now.
Project Manager: Well that's that's uh {disfmarker} Okay, so project evaluation. We have under twelve {vocalsound} Euros fifty. Project process, how do we think that went? Are we happy?
Industrial Designer: Oh.

User Interface: Mm-hmm.
Marketing: means uh at what standard what standard {disfmarker} whether it meets our standards or not. How mu What rating we will give to these products. So of course this is {disfmarker} will be a team work, w we together have to decide wha what rating we will give to this product and everything. So what methodology I will tell you on what basis we are going to discuss all this.
Project Manager: Okay.
Marketing: We will give the rating to this product based on the user requirements, whether it meets the user requirements or not, this product. Then trends, whether it is as {gap} fashion trends or not? Means {vocalsound} because we have already stated that people do prefer fashionable things nowadays.
User Interface: Mm-hmm.
Marketing: So this is also an important factor for our evaluation also. Then marketing strategy of the company. As we have already discussed that our company is quite {gap} in the market, not only in terms of providing quality products, not only in pro providing latest technologies, but also in terms of providing environmental s
User Interface: Sorry {gap}. Sorry,
Marketing: Yeah.
User Interface: carry on. {vocalsound}
Marketing: So {vocalsound} but also in terms of providing environmental safe products, uh yeah like uh keeping uh keeping in mind all the safety issues. So {disfmarker} Now comes the criteria rating with seven point scale. I'm having this scale this scale,
Project Manager: Okay.
Marketing: so we have to do it on a board.
User Interface: Mm-hmm.
Project Manager: {gap}
Marketing: {gap} the user requirem I think.
Project Manager: Alright, okay.
User Interface: Okay.
Project Manager: The board working again, is it?
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} Do we have the uh the marker for the board?
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
Marketing: {gap}
Project Manager: {vocalsound} Uh.
User Interface: Um.
Industrial Designer: There it is.
Marketing: {vocalsound} Thank you.
Project Manager: {vocalsound} {gap}
Marketing: So.
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Marketing: {vocalsound} So these are the three crite criterias for our evaluation of our product. First of all uh comes user requirement.
User Interface: Mm-hmm.
Marketing: So we will see whether this product meets all user requirements or not. I I will {disfmarker} first I would like to have your views, what do you think whether it meets all user requirements or not?
User Interface: Um {vocalsound} I think {disfmarker} Yeah, it did.
Marketing: S
User Interface: It had all the basic buttons that they needed as well as the uh new technology that people said they wanted.
Project Manager: Yeah.
User Interface: Um so.
Project Manager: When the user requirement is essentially just to operate the T_V_,
User Interface: Does it work?
Project Manager: so yeah,
User Interface: Yeah. So.
Marketing: {vocalsound} So what do you think you will personally give.
Project Manager: of course we haven't actually got a working model yet.
User Interface: I would say seven.
Marketing: Seven. Uh.
User Interface: {vocalsound} Seven is good, yeah, isn't it? I can't {disfmarker} True or false? No sorry tr one is true.
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: One, yeah.
Marketing: Uh one is {disfmarker} means highest ranking, okay.
User Interface: Yeah.
Marketing: But I think highest ranking is seven, or one?
Project Manager: No it's it's like true is one end, and false is the oth
Industrial Designer: No that's false.
Marketing: Okay, right right. So it's one for from your point of view.
User Interface: Okay, so one.
Marketing: And what do you say our Industrial Expert?
User Interface: Yep.
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} Uh. It's hard to know. I I give it a two. {vocalsound}
Marketing: Uh d you can you can tell on on the like {disfmarker}
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
Marketing: I think she has given her views on the basis of design, because she was our i Interface Expert.
Industrial Designer: Okay.
Marketing: But you can give your views based on technology, whether the technology meets the requirements of the customers or not?
Industrial Designer: Um yeah, I think i it might even exceed it um. But I guess there is a kind of a shortage of buttons.
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: Um {gap} I'm gonna give it a two.
Marketing: Two.
Industrial Designer: Two.
Marketing: And what about uh you, Brian?
Project Manager: Oh, I'll go for a one. {vocalsound}
Marketing: You will go for one.
Project Manager: Basic requirements but of the pro of the project.
Marketing: {vocalsound} Okay. Uh for me personally it is everything fine, it may be having good design, it may be uh meeting all the requirements of the customers like technology-wise, price-wise, but there is one thing which limits the customers, like we are having only two, three designs, like we are having one banana design and the other one is orange,
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: {vocalsound} Yeah th {vocalsound} {vocalsound}
Marketing: and
User Interface: Mm {vocalsound} yellow.
Marketing: {disfmarker} Uh yeah, lower end. And the third one is what you ge uh that is not a f fruit look.
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
Marketing: But if a person doesn't like banana, or orange, you are limiting him.
User Interface: Uh-huh.
Project Manager: Come on that was the tha {vocalsound} {vocalsound}
Marketing: No, don't buy our product, because we are l we like this only.
Project Manager: {vocalsound}'Kay.
User Interface: Uh-huh.
Marketing: So we are showing our preference for particular fruits,
User Interface: Okay.
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: {vocalsound} Being fruitist. {vocalsound} {vocalsound}
Marketing: two or three kinds rather, and {disfmarker} Yeah. {vocalsound} So.
User Interface: Is that no is that not trends?
Marketing: Uh no, uh personally as a Marketing Expert I don't believe that,
Project Manager: {vocalsound} {vocalsound}
Marketing: because whatever companies {disfmarker} they launch their products in the shape of fruits, they give a range of products, a range of shapes, like if we see, look at the smallest thing, toffee chocolates, they give a variety of different things.
User Interface: Mm-hmm.
Marketing: Some children like to buy banana shape, some apple shape, some even pineapple shape, some orange shape.
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Marketing: So you can {gap} {disfmarker} what shape a person will like.
User Interface: Mm-hmm.
Marketing: So in this case giving only one or two choices we are lim limiting our customers. And by limiting them, we are limiting our sales, limiting our profit also.
User Interface: Uh-huh. But in electronics, I think, it's not q always quite so um {disfmarker} you don't always have so many choices as with chocolates.
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
User Interface: I think, you know, if you're going to buy a T_V_ maybe a company'll have {disfmarker} That you're going to choose from, a company'll have two or three choices, but they're different designs. We were coming up with one product.
Marketing: Uh maybe. Okay but I will I will personally {disfmarker} won't give it {gap} beyond three.
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
User Interface: No, I mean uh {vocalsound} obviously your opinion,
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
User Interface: I'm just trying to {disfmarker} Okay.
Marketing: So we can {disfmarker}
Project Manager: {vocalsound} He's a tough cookie.
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Marketing: Yeah, on an average we can think three, four sevenths, maybe. Three or four?
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
Marketing: Uh, no sorry,
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Marketing: it should be {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Six. Five or six.
User Interface: What are we doing?
Industrial Designer: What are we doing?
Marketing: No sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, we are doing a very wrong thing.
User Interface: Adding them up?
Industrial Designer: We're gonna average them?
Marketing: Yeah, yeah, we are taking everything,
Industrial Designer: Okay. So seven fourths.
Marketing: and that's {disfmarker} I have taken it very wrongly.
User Interface: Oh.
Marketing: Yeah uh
Industrial Designer: About one point f one point eight.
Marketing: three four four two six seven seven sev Yeah one pe exactly. So we can say one or two.
Industrial Designer: Okay.
User Interface: Okay.
Marketing: {gap} because it is one point eight uh {gap} two, so we will do two.
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Oh I see.
Industrial Designer: Yeah round it up to two.
Marketing: Yeah.
User Interface: Okay, yeah.
Industrial Designer: So trends.
Marketing: So where were the trends.
Industrial Designer: Can you explain what you want us to write there?
Marketing: Sorry?
Industrial Designer: How it {disfmarker} how conforms to the current trends?
Marketing: Yeah, again the the fashion trends, this also like whether it it will be fashionable to have these products in the {vocalsound} uh as a fruit shape or something.
User Interface: Mm-hmm.
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
User Interface: Okay.
Marketing: Uh.
User Interface: Well um going on uh the specifications that we had, that fruit and vegetables are quite popular, and that people like something that is good to look at and not many buttons, I would give it um, well, because it's hard to make a fruit good to look at, that that looks cool, you know,
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
User Interface: so I would actually give it a three.
Marketing: {vocalsound}
User Interface: Tha three or four, I'm not sure.
Marketing: Okay. Yeah.
User Interface: Three. Go for three. That's fine.
Marketing: Uh {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer:'Kay. As far as the uh technology it its'got the latest trends in speech technology, but it's missing the screen, as we said, um but it does have the push-buttons, or the scroll-buttons, um but it doesn't have that fancy solar power or the the vibrating energy mechanism. So I give it a a four. I'd give it a kinda middle of the road for
User Interface: Mm.
Industrial Designer: for technology.
Project Manager: Yeah, I am sort of pret uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Just the fruit does me in, I mean uh it might
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: it might be trendy to some, but I'm just not swallowing the fruit, so um {vocalsound} {disfmarker}
User Interface: Yeah.
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Uh also uh I would have liked to have seen the L_C_D_ screen in it. Um so yeah I'd say about four as well.
Marketing: Okay. Uh personally I wi uh I think that in terms of trends, these products are quite good, like, these products are in fruit shape, because that wha people now {disfmarker} our fashion trend shows that people like everything {disfmarker} all f everything that is being advertised, like clothes, shoes, and everything is being advertised in the form of fruits and vegetables, or getting them {gap} or showing some association with them.
User Interface: Mm-hmm.
Marketing: So and in this way our product is good. And the second thing, now people don't want any complicated or bulky products and ours is quite simple and quite handy.
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
Marketing: So that is also ef that also {disfmarker}
User Interface: Mm-hmm.
Marketing: Our product meets the f the fashion uh trends of the market. And yes. It is cus spongy also. So they can play with it, it's quite good.
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
Marketing: So then I think, maybe I can give it two. So four five ten thirteen thirteen {gap}. So we can {disfmarker} Is it fine? So what about company strategy?
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
Marketing: {gap}
User Interface: Um.
Industrial Designer: Well it was yellow. {vocalsound}
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
User Interface: Yeah, the company strategy, okay. Um {vocalsound} there was lot of discussing, that was good. Um I feel I got my say. Um so I'd give the company strategy a {vocalsound} two.
Industrial Designer: Well, I think it's the the remote control conforms to the the company strategy.
Marketing: Okay.
User Interface: Okay.
Industrial Designer: Is that the question?
Project Manager: Yeah, yeah.
User Interface: Is it? Okay.
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} Um.
User Interface: Okay, so {vocalsound} one or two.
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
User Interface: One. Okay, just leave it, it's fine.
Industrial Designer: I'll go with two.
Marketing: So what about you, Brian?
Project Manager: Um yeah, a three. Pretty much kept to the company strategy, so I would go for a {disfmarker} a one, as we not only kept it, but we were limited by {disfmarker}
User Interface: Mm.
Marketing: Yeah, and me also, like, this product me uh me uh me uh this meets all company strategy like our product should be as per customers'requirement, as per latest technology, and it should be environmental safe. So since our product meets all these requirements, so I would also prefer to give it rank one. So four six six
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} So one and a half.
Marketing: half.
User Interface: Yeah, one.
Marketing: So we can say two or one {gap} {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: A two. {gap}
Marketing: Okay. So th seven seven. Uh overall we are getting two {gap} something, but we can round it as two.
Industrial Designer: Yep.
Marketing: Yeah. So I think overall uh evaluation of our product is quite good.
Project Manager: Cool, groovy. {vocalsound}
User Interface: Okay.
Industrial Designer: S
Marketing: So we can launch it. Yeah.
Project Manager: Cool. Brilliant. {vocalsound}
User Interface: Woo-hoo.
Project Manager: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} In which case we are done.'Cause we've evaluated and we are within budget. {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} Okay.
User Interface: Cool.
Marketing: So
Project Manager: Champagne lunch anyone? {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
User Interface: Yeah.
Marketing: yeah. {vocalsound} Great. {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: Uh.","In general, the team came up with two ways to reduce the costs. First, they would essentially remain the same shape as the prototypes, but just have it flattened. In User Interface's words, it would be more like a traditional remote control. Second, the team reached a consensus that the design of double curves shall be changed into a single curve since it was the biggest expense there. Luckily, after the discussion, the overall cost of the new remote controls went down to eleven Euros sixty.",qmsum

Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: is, um, um,
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: as a team we're going to be designing and creating a new kind of remote control. Um, we want this to be a marketable product that can be trendy, um, a completely new style, so that, um, can really appeal to a, to a generation that doesn't want a simple plain kind of, uh, channel-changer. And, um, it needs to be user-friendly for, um, maybe, for an example, for people that, um, can't see the numbers as well, or, um, perhaps an ergonomic design.
Industrial Designer: Okay. So this is a television remote control?
Project Manager: Yes, it's a television remote control.
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
Project Manager: Right. I believe I should be taking minutes on this right now. So, alright.
Industrial Designer: Okay.
Project Manager: Um, yeah. Um, the way that we're going to go about this is, um, we'll have a time where we can, um come up with new ideas alone, and, and work on the project and then, um, after we've brainstormed and, and thought about, we can come together in a meeting and, and discuss what, what um, what kind of functional design we want to use. Same with conceptual design and detailed design. So, um, making sure that it, it's usable, that as a, um {disfmarker} and that it's, it's feasible to create, and uh, to come up with a concept of it want, what we want it to look like. Um, tool training. Is, is everyone, um {disfmarker} {gap} Okay.

Marketing: Yeah.
Project Manager: Great. Great.

And, um, as a sort of team-building moment, um, I, I'd like us to, um, try out the whiteboard by expressing our favourite animal and the charac characteristics of that animal.
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Marketing: {vocalsound}
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Um, why that, why that should be your favourite animal. So, um, I, I'm assuming that we should do that now.
Industrial Designer: Okay.

Project Manager: My favourite animal, which changes all the time, okay,
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: right now it is an elk.
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} Okay.
User Interface: An elk?
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: alright, so {disfmarker}
User Interface: {vocalsound} A vicious {disfmarker} {vocalsound}
Project Manager: And it goes like {disfmarker} Yeah it's got like big antlers,
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: yeah. Looks kinda like, like it has holly growing out of its head.
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: Do you have elk where you come from?
Project Manager: Yes.
Industrial Designer: You do.
Project Manager: Yeah

User Interface: That is really good.
Project Manager: {vocalsound} Thanks.
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} Yeah. {vocalsound}
User Interface: I'm quite {disfmarker} {vocalsound}
Project Manager: This is my {disfmarker}
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Marketing: Oh, very shapely.
Project Manager: Okay.
Industrial Designer: Brilliant.
Project Manager: That's a sketching of my my elk, and it, it is my favourite animal right now,'cause it is a large beautiful majestic creature,
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: that um, that um {disfmarker}
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: In a way it looks kind of awkward, because it's on spindly legs and it uh {disfmarker}
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: But it can really overcome harsh terrain, and although it's gorgeous it's also very dangerous, because it has um strong antlers, and uh it can really combat its enemies, even like it it's a it's an herbivore but, uh, it can really defend itself.
Industrial Designer: Mm.
Project Manager: Yeah.
Industrial Designer: Very nice. Okay.
Project Manager: Right.
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Right, I'm gonna take minutes while, um, you guys express your favourite animals.
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: Okay, I'll go next. I am a big animal lover. like all sorts of animals, but for the moment I'm gonna draw a cat, in memory of my poor cat that died recently. {vocalsound}
Marketing: {vocalsound} Oh.
Project Manager: Oh.
Industrial Designer: It's gonna be a bit of a strange drawing, but never mind.
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: Not as artistic as Heather's drawing.
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: Bit more cartoon style.
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: But I like cats because they're so independent, and they always seem to be doing what they want to be doing. Um, but that doesn't mean they're completely not sociable,'cause they enjoy interacting with humans as well, and they seem to enjoy the good things like sunshine and, um, running around outside as well as being inside, and enjoying their food, and generally just, they just seemed so cool and {vocalsound} they just know what they're doing.
User Interface: {vocalsound} {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: Uh I reckon they're sort of, they got it sorted. They know what they want.
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} Basically, that's why I like cats. {vocalsound}
User Interface: Very good. {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Great.
Industrial Designer: {gap} I'll rub that out. There you go. {vocalsound}
User Interface: Okay. I think my favourite animal would be a dog, but I'm not really sure {vocalsound} how to draw one.
Industrial Designer: Ooh.
User Interface: I, I've never drawn a dog, I don't think. I'm tempted to draw a snail'cause I draw them sometimes {vocalsound} and they're really easy to draw.
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
User Interface: Um,
Project Manager: I forget her name.
User Interface: right it's gonna be a really funny dog,'cause I'm not sure how to draw a dog.
Marketing: Tara
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
Marketing: or Tara.
Industrial Designer: Well there are loads of different types of dogs, so I'm sure it'll represent one kind of dog. {vocalsound}
User Interface: {vocalsound} It's a cartoon dog I think.
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
User Interface: A s I don't ev Oh, oh well. {vocalsound} It's a scary cartoon dog. That {disfmarker} This,
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
User Interface: that does not look like a dog.
Project Manager: {vocalsound} It looks kinda like a person. {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} We can pretend. {vocalsound}
User Interface: {vocalsound} I'm sorry.
Marketing: {vocalsound} That's Pinocchio.
User Interface: {vocalsound} {gap} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} How do you draw a dog? I suppose it has a lon Oh my god. Right. Yous know what it's supposed to be.
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} Okay.
User Interface: {vocalsound} It's a dog. {vocalsound}. Um, I like dogs because, um, they're so good to humans, like they can be trained to be police dogs and seeing-eye dogs, and they're just such friendly animals. And, like they're more of a companion than cats.
Industrial Designer: Yeah, that's true.
User Interface: {vocalsound} I've nothing against cats. Cats don't really like me, so I can't like them.
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
Marketing: {vocalsound}
User Interface: {vocalsound} But they're just so friendly and warm and nice animals,
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
User Interface: {vocalsound} that don't look like that. {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Marketing: {vocalsound} Alrighty. I feel like a robot.
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Marketing: {vocalsound} Okay. Um, well I guess I had the most time to think about it. I'm going to draw a butterfly, because I saw a butterfly yesterday, that seemed to be like the symbol of Spring arriving. And it was actually the prettiest butterfly I've ever seen out in the wild, and I though that was pretty cool in Scotland. It was like, well it was a little pointier than that. At first I thought it was a dead leaf.
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Marketing: And then it landed on the wall next to me. But this part was all brown and then it has these big blue dots like this. And then it kinda {disfmarker} there was a green, I think it was a green ring, and there was like red going out like this.
Project Manager: It's kinda like a peacock.
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Marketing: Yeah, it kinda was actually,'cause it was {disfmarker} This part of the body was really dull, and then it was the most colourful exotic butterfly ever, and I'm like, wow this is the middle of Scotland in like March.
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Marketing: So I thought that was pretty cool. And it landed by a wall and let me look at it for about two minutes. I wish I'd had my camera. So that's gonna be my favourite animal because after all the snow it seemed to say that like Spring is finally here. Yeah.
Industrial Designer: Very nice. {vocalsound}
Marketing: There you go.
Project Manager: Great.
Marketing: {vocalsound} Uh, what do we {disfmarker} Oh.
Project Manager: Do you hear the eraser buzzing while you do that?
Marketing: Yes I do. {vocalsound} {gap}
Project Manager: Yea {vocalsound} Right.
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: So, now that we know how to use the whiteboard,
Industrial Designer: Okay.
Project Manager: um, the next, um, thing we need to address is our financial department, to meet our our budget, um {disfmarker} or not meet our budget but more, um, like what kind of, uh, selling range we'll be looking at, um, wanna make this um {gap} selling price of twenty five Euros. And so we have to, um, come up with a way to, to create a, a uh remote control, where um we can {disfmarker} like the price to create it will be significantly less. Um, we'd like to, um to, uh, make fifty million Euro. I'm assuming that's what the M_ means. Um, and make it for an international market. Um, one thing we'd have to think about internationally is in the design of, um, like different kinds of, uh, V_C_R_s. Things like that, depending on which country you are. Another thing for the design team to think about. Um, we want it to cost, uh, absolute maximum of twelve Euro and fifty cents.
Marketing: Okay, so we'll have a hundred percent profit then? Twelve fifty.
Project Manager: I'm bad at math.
Marketing: Okay.
Project Manager:'Kay. {vocalsound} Um,
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: so now that, um, that is underway, um
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: it is discussion time. So this is time for us to bring our initial ideas, any um suggestions that you may have so far, a um your personal experiences with remote controls, and um, um, areas you see that, uh, could be improved in your experience with them. Does anyone have any initial thoughts?
Marketing: I find that in the dark it's often hard to know what button you're pushing.
Project Manager: Mm-hmm. So what's something we could, uh, do to remedy that?
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Marketing: {gap}
Industrial Designer: Okay.
Marketing: Um {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: I always find that in our house the remote control always goes missing.
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: It's always, where is the remote control?
User Interface: {vocalsound} Yeah.
Industrial Designer: So maybe if you could have some kind of tracking {vocalsound} device for the remote control or some signal that you could find out where it was.
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: I dunno, some kind of alarm. You can press a button on your wall, {gap} signal,
Project Manager: Yeah. It's a great idea. It's a great idea.
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer:'cause it always gets lost.
User Interface: Do yous not find that, um, {vocalsound} like, there's a lot of, um, buttons on your remote control, and you don't know what half of them do.
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
Marketing: Mm-hmm.
Industrial Designer: Yeah, that you don't use half of them. {vocalsound}
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
User Interface: Yeah, I don't know what they do. {vocalsound}
Marketing: Mm-hmm. There's some remote controls where there's kind of a hidden panel, so all those buttons that you don't really use unless you're programming or something.
User Interface: Yeah.
Industrial Designer: Yeah, that's, that's {disfmarker}
Marketing: That's useful.
Industrial Designer: Yeah, it is. Yeah.
Marketing: So you just have like the number buttons, power button, T_V_ video button.
User Interface: Yeah.
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
Project Manager: Alright. Anything about, um, the look of the, uh, remote control that you might have ideas about. Maybe it could be, instead of like a standard rectangular shape, it could be, um, something more interesting like {disfmarker}
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Any ideas will do that you have at this point.
Industrial Designer: Mm.
Marketing: Could be shaped like a conch,
Project Manager: {vocalsound} Can hold it.
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} A novelty.
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Marketing: you know. Be like a shell-shaped remote. {vocalsound} {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Yeah.
Industrial Designer: Are we going into kind of novelty factors here. Like, I've seen phones like a {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Well if it's a trendy original, um, aspect we're going for.
Industrial Designer: Okay.
Project Manager: I mean, you're the designers, you c, you can um decide what kind of, um, direction you wanna go in,
Industrial Designer: Yeah. Mm-hmm.
User Interface: Yeah.
Project Manager: but at this point in the, in the first meeting it can be any ideas that we just throw out there.
Industrial Designer: Yeah. I suppose, if we're he heading to have it, like make a huge profit out of this, it needs to be quite a universally accepted thing. Like, a novelty thing might only sell a few things rather than, like, a general kind of more acceptable {disfmarker}
User Interface: Yeah.
Marketing: {vocalsound} {vocalsound}.
Project Manager: Mm-hmm.
Industrial Designer: But we don't wanna go towards boring,'cause that wouldn't sell either.
Project Manager: Yeah.
Industrial Designer: So, hmm.
Project Manager: And the key issue here is, is being trendy and original. Um, that does not necessarily mean it needs to be outrageous.
Industrial Designer: Yeah. Yeah.
Project Manager: Right. Okay we have five minutes left. So, just to cover {disfmarker} We have one more thing. Um, like you can go over your ideas, of course, in your own personal times. Um, our next meeting will be in half an hour.
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
Project Manager: So you have half an hour to, uh, think about what you want to present. Or not present but bring to the meeting. Um, I_D_, whatever that stands for.
Industrial Designer: Industrial Designer.
Marketing: Interface?
Project Manager: Industrial Designer.
Industrial Designer: That's me. {vocalsound}
Marketing: Oh, industrial.
Project Manager: I have to remember these things. Um. You'll be beginning your, your working design.
Industrial Designer: Mm-hmm.
Project Manager: Um, U_I_D_ the technical functions design will, will be worked on the next thirty minutes. Um, {vocalsound} maybe how this can be achieved, and, um, we need the user requirements from the manag Marketing Expert.
Marketing: Marketing Expert. {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Um, you will get specific instructions, um, of what to do in the next half an hour. And I'll see you in half an hour, okay?
Industrial Designer: Okay.
Project Manager:'Kay.
Industrial Designer: Thank you.
User Interface: {gap}","The team took turns to draw their favourite animals on the whiteboard while discussing what characteristics of that animal they liked. Project Manager's favourite animal at the time was an elk, since she considered it a large beautiful majestic creature that can overcome harsh terrain and defend itself. Industrial Designer followed with a cat, favoured for its independence and always knowing what they were doing. User Interface drew a dog, for dogs were trainable and friendly. Finally, Marketing chose a butterfly, seeing it as the symbol of spring arriving.",qmsum
"What new functions could their remote have based on the team's brainstorming process?
Project Manager: Alright, that did nothing. Okay. Welcome to the meeting everyone. Just gonna attempt to make this into a slide show. Sorry guys.

Industrial Designer: Hello. {vocalsound}
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Okay. So um. So that was the opening.
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: The first thing we'll do is get acquainted with one another. If everyone could go around and explain their role and um, and their name.
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: Okay. My name's Poppy. I'm the Industrial Designer for this project. Um, I'm going to be responsible for the functional design phase. Also the conceptual design and the detailed design for the final product.
Project Manager: Nice to meet you Poppy.
Industrial Designer: Okay. {vocalsound}
User Interface: {vocalsound} My name's Tara and I'm the User Interface Designer.

Project Manager: Alright I'm Heather and I've I said I'm your Project Manager, um Well you can pretty much read what it is that I'm doing. But um um {disfmarker}
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Yeah. And uh tool training is one thing that we're going to be doing today, um um as well as planning the project, how we're going to, uh, create this product, and, um, discuss, um, our aims and objects of this, Which brings us to our next subject,
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: is, um, um,
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: as a team we're going to be designing and creating a new kind of remote control. Um, we want this to be a marketable product that can be trendy, um, a completely new style, so that, um, can really appeal to a, to a generation that doesn't want a simple plain kind of, uh, channel-changer. And, um, it needs to be user-friendly for, um, maybe, for an example, for people that, um, can't see the numbers as well, or, um, perhaps an ergonomic design.
Industrial Designer: Okay. So this is a television remote control?
Project Manager: Yes, it's a television remote control.
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
Project Manager: Right. I believe I should be taking minutes on this right now. So, alright.
Industrial Designer: Okay.
Project Manager: Um, yeah. Um, the way that we're going to go about this is, um, we'll have a time where we can, um come up with new ideas alone, and, and work on the project and then, um, after we've brainstormed and, and thought about, we can come together in a meeting and, and discuss what, what um, what kind of functional design we want to use. Same with conceptual design and detailed design. So, um, making sure that it, it's usable, that as a, um {disfmarker} and that it's, it's feasible to create, and uh, to come up with a concept of it want, what we want it to look like. Um, tool training. Is, is everyone, um {disfmarker} {gap} Okay.
Industrial Designer: Yeah. Got those notes.
Marketing: Yeah.
Project Manager: Great. Great.
Marketing: Thank you.
Project Manager: Um One thing that, uh, we're going to do is become more acquainted with the, the tools that we have access to for our project. Um, one of them is our whiteboard. And, um, as a sort of team-building moment, um, I, I'd like us to, um, try out the whiteboard by expressing our favourite animal and the charac characteristics of that animal.
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Marketing: {vocalsound}
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Um, why that, why that should be your favourite animal. So, um, I, I'm assuming that we should do that now.
Industrial Designer: Okay.
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Project Manager:'Kay.
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: {vocalsound} With our microphones still attached to our bodies. Okay. {vocalsound}

Industrial Designer: Okay, let's stand up and support you {vocalsound}
Project Manager: okay cool, um {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: My favourite animal, which changes all the time, okay,
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: right now it is an elk.
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} Okay.
User Interface: An elk?
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: alright, so {disfmarker}
User Interface: {vocalsound} A vicious {disfmarker} {vocalsound}
Project Manager: And it goes like {disfmarker} Yeah it's got like big antlers,
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: yeah. Looks kinda like, like it has holly growing out of its head.
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: Do you have elk where you come from?
Project Manager: Yes.
Industrial Designer: You do.
Project Manager: Yeah
Marketing: We have moose too. {vocalsound}

Project Manager: {vocalsound} Thanks.
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} Yeah. {vocalsound}
User Interface: I'm quite {disfmarker} {vocalsound}
Project Manager: This is my {disfmarker}
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Marketing: Oh, very shapely.
Project Manager: Okay.
Industrial Designer: Brilliant.
Project Manager: That's a sketching of my my elk, and it, it is my favourite animal right now,'cause it is a large beautiful majestic creature,
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: that um, that um {disfmarker}
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: In a way it looks kind of awkward, because it's on spindly legs and it uh {disfmarker}
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: But it can really overcome harsh terrain, and although it's gorgeous it's also very dangerous, because it has um strong antlers, and uh it can really combat its enemies, even like it it's a it's an herbivore but, uh, it can really defend itself.
Industrial Designer: Mm.
Project Manager: Yeah.
Industrial Designer: Very nice. Okay.
Project Manager: Right.
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Right, I'm gonna take minutes while, um, you guys express your favourite animals.
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: Okay, I'll go next. I am a big animal lover. like all sorts of animals, but for the moment I'm gonna draw a cat, in memory of my poor cat that died recently. {vocalsound}
Marketing: {vocalsound} Oh.
Project Manager: Oh.
Industrial Designer: It's gonna be a bit of a strange drawing, but never mind.
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: Not as artistic as Heather's drawing.
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: Bit more cartoon style.
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: But I like cats because they're so independent, and they always seem to be doing what they want to be doing. Um, but that doesn't mean they're completely not sociable,'cause they enjoy interacting with humans as well, and they seem to enjoy the good things like sunshine and, um, running around outside as well as being inside, and enjoying their food, and generally just, they just seemed so cool and {vocalsound} they just know what they're doing.
User Interface: {vocalsound} {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: Uh I reckon they're sort of, they got it sorted. They know what they want.
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} Basically, that's why I like cats. {vocalsound}
User Interface: Very good. {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Great.
Industrial Designer: {gap} I'll rub that out. There you go. {vocalsound}

Industrial Designer: Yeah. I suppose, if we're he heading to have it, like make a huge profit out of this, it needs to be quite a universally accepted thing. Like, a novelty thing might only sell a few things rather than, like, a general kind of more acceptable {disfmarker}
User Interface: Yeah.
Marketing: {vocalsound} {vocalsound}.
Project Manager: Mm-hmm.
Industrial Designer: But we don't wanna go towards boring,'cause that wouldn't sell either.
Project Manager: Yeah.
Industrial Designer: So, hmm.
Project Manager: And the key issue here is, is being trendy and original. Um, that does not necessarily mean it needs to be outrageous.
Industrial Designer: Yeah. Yeah.
Project Manager: Right. Okay we have five minutes left. So, just to cover {disfmarker} We have one more thing. Um, like you can go over your ideas, of course, in your own personal times. Um, our next meeting will be in half an hour.
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
Project Manager: So you have half an hour to, uh, think about what you want to present. Or not present but bring to the meeting. Um, I_D_, whatever that stands for.
Industrial Designer: Industrial Designer.
Marketing: Interface?
Project Manager: Industrial Designer.
Industrial Designer: That's me. {vocalsound}
Marketing: Oh, industrial.
Project Manager: I have to remember these things. Um. You'll be beginning your, your working design.
Industrial Designer: Mm-hmm.
Project Manager: Um, U_I_D_ the technical functions design will, will be worked on the next thirty minutes. Um, {vocalsound} maybe how this can be achieved, and, um, we need the user requirements from the manag Marketing Expert.
Marketing: Marketing Expert. {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Um, you will get specific instructions, um, of what to do in the next half an hour. And I'll see you in half an hour, okay?
Industrial Designer: Okay.
Project Manager:'Kay.
Industrial Designer: Thank you.
User Interface: {gap}","One function could be to let the buttons be distinguishable even in the dark, so that one could use the remote whether there was light or not. Another function could be to track the remote when it goes lost, probably realized through some kind of alarm on the remote and a button installed somewhere else. One last proposed function was to design a hidden panel for the remote, containing all the less used buttons so that they wouldn't take up too much space on the main panel and confuse the user.",qmsum
"Summarize the whole meeting.
Project Manager: Okay um, welcome to our detailed design meeting. I'm pretty excited. Let's start it's approximately fifteen forty or something like that. Okay um the agenda {disfmarker} we're gonna do an opening and then um I'll talk about the minutes from the last meeting, what we d discussed um, then we'll have the prototype presentation and a look at the evaluation criteria. We'll look at the finances and finally a {disfmarker} do a production evaluation and close. So, starting off with the um last {disfmarker} the last one, oh I don't have it here um, but we talked about energy, we're gonna use a kinetic battery um, we want to use a simple chip, because we're not gonna need a a shuffle um, we're gonna need a scroll um, we're choosing a latex case w in fruity colours that's curved and um we're using push buttons uh with a supplement of an on-screen menu. And it sounded like we had set um like eight or nine buttons, including five pre-set channels. Okay? Let's do the look and feel design presentation first.
User Interface: Right, do you wanna start?
Industrial Designer: Right, well we made three different prototypes and I guess we'll start with with this one. Um we have our colours not {disfmarker} are not fixed, but this is the general shape. Um it's {disfmarker} you hold it sort of either like like this in your left hand or you switch it over and uh it's easily adaptable to either hand. You can push the buttons with your thumb like a mobile phone, or you can push them with your index finger of your other hand, or even {disfmarker} I mean there's a whole variety, you can hold it like this and press it with your same index finger. Uh we have the on off button at the tip, very visible, very big. We have our up and down buttons, which are also gonna be our channel selectors, and we have our little menu button here. If you push {disfmarker} if you're just pushing these normally, they're the menu buttons, if {disfmarker} uh the volume buttons rather. If you press select once, they become channel changing buttons. If we press select three times, the menu with the other features and pro possibly also with your T_V_ channel choices shows up, and you have your five presets down here. Um if people wanna grab hold of that, see how it feels in your hand. That's our number one prototype. Um do you wanna present the potato,
Project Manager: {gap} like a little lightning in it.
Industrial Designer: or shall I present the Martian?
User Interface: Okay,
Project Manager: The little lightning bolt in it, very cute.
User Interface: um {disfmarker} What {disfmarker} We call that one the rhombus,
Marketing: I could {disfmarker}
Project Manager: The v the rhombus rhombus?
User Interface: uh the rhombus.
Industrial Designer: That's the rhombus, yep.
User Interface: Um this one is known as the potato, uh it's
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
User Interface: it's a {vocalsound}
Marketing: {vocalsound}
User Interface: how can I present it? It's an ergonomic shape, so it it fits in your hand nicely. Um it's designed to be used either in your left hand or or in your right hand. Um I've gone here just for just for four buttons on this one. Um the two blue buttons here are for adjusting the volume. So you've got volume up and volume down on the other side here. Um the red ones are for uh changing channels, channel up and channel down and that's um moves between your favourite channels that you've selected. Uh this middle button here brings up the on-screen menu and when you're working in the on-screen menu you use the other four buttons to navigate around the menu system and the middle button uh to select and that's basically it, that's the potato.
Project Manager: Um on, off?
User Interface: Uh that would be one of your channels, basically,
Project Manager: Okay.
User Interface: so like channel zero would be t to switch switch the machine off,
Project Manager: Yeah we turn it off.
User Interface: yeah.
Marketing: Could the middle button of the on-screen menu function as a power button?
User Interface: Um not really,
Industrial Designer: {gap}
User Interface: it would make it hard to turn the machine off, to turn your T_V_ off.
Project Manager: Mm-hmm.
Industrial Designer: If you pressed and held it maybe.
User Interface: Yeah yeah, that that'd be one way of doing it, yeah. That'd work, yeah.
Marketing: If you like held it down, that would be on off.
Industrial Designer: Yeah. On off, that's a possibility, yeah.
Project Manager: Okay.
Industrial Designer: And then finally we have um the Martian or the pear, either way. Um it's a bit different, just a little bit more of a creative feel. Uh you have the on off toggle stem on the top. {vocalsound} We have the five preset seeds {vocalsound}.
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} And then you have on the sides to make it a little bit more three-dimensional, you have your channel changing, volume changing buttons and your menu button right here in the middle. So, that's for your consideration as well, plus it's an interesting talking point to have standing up.
User Interface: Let's pass.
Industrial Designer: We figured it could stand up like this on your table, if you wanted it to, if I made the bot the bottom flat. {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Uh-huh. {vocalsound}
Marketing: Sorry, what's the yellow one in the middle,
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} Uh the menu select button. {vocalsound}
Marketing: I forgot.
Project Manager: {gap} Very interesting. {vocalsound} I think that one's my favourite.
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
User Interface: So that's {disfmarker} So that's our three prototypes. Um basically, in terms of making decisions, what we'd need to do is first of all decide on a form uh which of the three different shapes we want, then decide what kind of button layout we want, how many buttons, and then to choose what colours we want to make the buttons and if we wanna put any text on the device, like label on the buttons or put a brand name or or a logo on it or whatever.
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Mm-hmm.
Industrial Designer: We were we were thinking that normally we'd go for fruity colours, but maybe we're also thinking that your sort of middle aged man, for an example customer, might not want a fruity coloured remote, so m maybe we'd have one version that's a bit toned down,
Project Manager: Mm'kay.
Industrial Designer: maybe with with less contrasts on it. Yeah, something still a little bright to make it hard to lose, but {disfmarker}
User Interface: Would {disfmarker} Yeah, but we don't want it to look like a kids'toy {gap}.
Industrial Designer: {gap} yeah.
Project Manager: Now that was one thing that we brought up over email. I don't know if you picked up your email, but um the f the um feature that we considered for it not getting lost.
User Interface: Yeah.
Industrial Designer: Right. Well we were we were talking about that a little bit when we got that email and we think that each of these are so distinctive, that it {disfmarker} it's not just like another piece of technology around your house. It's gonna be somewhere that it can be seen.
Project Manager: Mm-hmm.
Industrial Designer: So we're we're not thinking that it's gonna be as critical to have the loss {disfmarker}
Marketing: But if it's like under covers or like in a couch you still can't see it.
Project Manager: It's really {disfmarker} Would it be very difficult to um just have an external device that like I dunno, you tape to your to your T_V_ um that when you press it you ha a little light beep goes off? Do you think that would be conceptually possible?
Industrial Designer: I think {disfmarker}
User Interface: I think it would be difficult technologically,
Project Manager: Mm-hmm.
User Interface: because if your if your remote's lost it's probably under the settee and in that case you can't you can't send an infrared sing signal to it to find it,
Project Manager: Mm.
User Interface: s so it's {disfmarker} I'm not quite sure how it would work
Project Manager: That's true, mm'kay.
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
User Interface: and then I wonder if it's if it's more just a gimmick then anything else. Uh I mean ho how many times do you really, seriously lose your remote control and would would a device like that actually help you to find it?
Industrial Designer: There might be something that you can do in the circuit board and the chip to make it make a noise or something, but it would take a lot more development than we have this afternoon.
Project Manager: Mm-hmm. Okay, that's a fair evaluation. Getting lost. Um we {disfmarker} so we do we've decided not to worry about that for now. Okay'cause {disfmarker} well, the designs are very bright, so you're right, they're gonna stick out, but um {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: So d do people have a preference as far as feel and functionality? Um.
Marketing: I feel like this is simil {vocalsound} or it's sort of what already exists so if we're trying to think of something sort of like new and fun, even though this is like what you're init I'm initially drawn to, just'cause it's like comfortable and like not different. I sort of like this one, like I I don't know why, it just it's like small but still sort of like cute looking, I dunno. But I also like the b the side buttons on that one, like I think that's kind of neat.
Project Manager: Mm-hmm.
Marketing: But I dunno how much any of this has to do with the fashionable, sort of cool looking thing that we also need to focus on {vocalsound}.
Project Manager: Could we maybe have like an extra button on the top for on off? So then w we wouldn't have to have like a dual function?
Industrial Designer: Mm yeah,
User Interface: Yeah, it's possible, yeah, yeah.
Marketing: Ah,
Industrial Designer: that's good, that's good.
Marketing: there we go.
Industrial Designer: Here, stick it on.
User Interface: {vocalsound} Put an extra the button on {gap} {vocalsound}.
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Sure.
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Um uh why don't we do a product evaluation using your criteria, if you've developed some?
Marketing: Well do we w {vocalsound} like I think we're supposed to have one that we do it for.
Project Manager: Oh okay. Okay.
Marketing: That was {vocalsound} {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: So where {disfmarker}
Marketing: I was a little vague on what exactly I'm supposed to do, but let me {disfmarker} I have to like write something on the whiteboard, so.
Project Manager: Okay. Do you need this
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: or just write on the white board?
Marketing: No, I actually don't have like a PowerPointy thing,
Project Manager: Okay.
Industrial Designer: Right.
Marketing:'cause I think it would be redundant.
Industrial Designer: Okay.
Marketing: I dunno.
Project Manager: It's kind of like uh like a joystick kind of thing,
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} Ooh.
Project Manager: you know,
User Interface: {vocalsound} Cool.
Project Manager: kinda push it {vocalsound}.
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} Hey.
Project Manager:'Kay.
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Maybe a little smaller than that {gap}.
Industrial Designer: No, I kinda like it.
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: That's hard to miss.
User Interface: It makes look more fruity as well.
Project Manager: Oh it does,
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: it's kind of like {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {gap} {vocalsound}
User Interface: It's like a deformed foot, I dunno. {vocalsound}
Project Manager: There it could have a stem like that,'cause I do l kind of like the stem.
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} Like {disfmarker} {vocalsound}
User Interface: Yeah.
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Yeah. It almost helps you ge keep a grip too,'cause it goes in between fingers {gap}.
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
User Interface: Yeah.
Industrial Designer: Interesting.
Project Manager: I like this one.
Industrial Designer: Okay,
Project Manager: Variety of colours are nice.
Industrial Designer: is that where people are leaning then, the potato? I like the idea of the {disfmarker}
Project Manager: I think I'm leaning towards the potato.
Industrial Designer: I mean that's really gotten the simplicity of the buttons down, that one.
Project Manager: Mm-hmm. I am worried about like um using a menu. Um in that {disfmarker} like i withing menus there are submenus, and so how do you get back to the main menu?
Industrial Designer: Hmm.
User Interface: Yeah.
Industrial Designer: Well that {disfmarker} on the iPod, for example, you just {disfmarker} every time you wanna go back you hit the menu button again and it brings you back one level.
Project Manager: But that has a menu button separate from a select button, whereas if this one's both the menu and the select button?
User Interface: Yeah.
Industrial Designer: Good point.
User Interface: This is, it's {disfmarker} the up and down buttons are used for scrolling up and down for a list of choices.
Project Manager: Okay.
User Interface: You find the choice that you want and you press uh you press the right button uh.
Project Manager: {vocalsound} Could these be used for going to submenus
Marketing: {gap}
User Interface: Yeah. Yeah, so they're used for going into and out of your submenus, yeah.
Project Manager: or {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} Maybe {disfmarker} yeah,
Project Manager: Okay.
Industrial Designer: maybe it can be one of those, if you press down and hold for two seconds, then it brings you back one level or something.
Project Manager: Mm-hmm. Okay. Well, as long as we have that in mind as we're designing it still, mm'kay.
Marketing: Okay, so which one are we sort of roughly looking at to address whether or not it meets our s um necessities, the yellowy one is that {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: The potato? Are we leaning towards the potato?
User Interface: Potato.
Project Manager: {vocalsound} I think so.
Marketing: Okay, well we can obviously change it after we go through each different one.
Industrial Designer: Okay.
Marketing: So basically what we need to do is some of the things that we've talked about before we need to make sure that that remote actually does conform to the things that we said it was going to.
Industrial Designer: Okay.
Marketing: So what we sort of wanna do is that we each need to separately rank each of the following things and then I'll tabulate an average just to make sure that it does meet that.
Industrial Designer: Okay.
Marketing: So we'll just go through them one at a time and we'll just go around and each of you can tell me on a scale of one to seven with one being really extremely true and seven being not true at all, or false, if the remote that we've created conforms to the following criteria. So we can do this one first. First we wanna know if it meets the fancy look and feel um objective. So like in my opinion the {vocalsound} {disfmarker} for now at least, the yellow one is probably somewhere in the middle so I'm gonna say it's like a three. That's just my opinion.
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
Marketing: What does {vocalsound} each of you {disfmarker}
Project Manager: I I kind of think it's it's unique enough that I'd give it a one or a two.
Marketing: Okay, well give it a number,
Project Manager: Okay.
Marketing: sorry {vocalsound}.
Project Manager: I will give it a one.
Industrial Designer: Um I dunno if it's it's creative. I dunno if fancy is the word I would use. I dunno if any of them are fancy in {disfmarker} I'd say two, because c unique.
Marketing: Okay.
User Interface: I'll go for two.
Marketing: And two, awesome. Alright, and same sort of scale for functionality, is it functional? I think it's extremely functional, I'm gonna give it a one.
Industrial Designer: Yeah, one.
Marketing: One?
User Interface: I think it's it's functional, it's also pretty basic, so I'll give it a two.
Marketing: Okay.
Project Manager: Um functional. I think it'll get everything done, I think it might be a little confusing at first, um, I don't know if that's gonna be a later one.
Marketing: Okay. Well there's some other ones, I will address that,
Project Manager: Okay, then I'm gonna give it a two.
Marketing: yeah. Awesome, okay. Um we wanna know next if it's technologically innovative.
Project Manager: Did you give a functional {gap}?
Marketing: Yeah, she said it was one.
Project Manager: Okay.
Marketing: Um is it technologically innovative? Mm. Not really, I mean not so much,'cause we we don't have the L_C_D_ screen, we don't have fancy chip. Other than what it looks like, I dunno if it's really {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Well, the kinetic battery.
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} In the battery, that's it.
Marketing: I kinetic battery is a big one, so.
Industrial Designer: How many people would notice that, though?
Marketing: Mm. But it {disfmarker}
Project Manager: But they'll notice it after like a year,
Marketing: but we know it's there.
Project Manager: they'll be like hey, I have never changed the battery.
Marketing: And if it's made of like latex, that whole idea, that's pretty cool.
Project Manager: Mm. Just the material.
Marketing: I'll give it a three.'Cause it {disfmarker} we could've picked a lot of features that would've made it really {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Yeah. I I would say that it's {disfmarker} Yeah, like fancy versus creative it's it's different. But does that equal innovative? I dunno. I'll give it a three.
Marketing: Alright. Everyone else?
User Interface: I'd say it's technologically it's not it's not unique, I mean it's it's just {disfmarker} it is just pushbuttons um, so I I'd give it a four.
Project Manager: Think I'm gonna go with the four as well.
Marketing: Mm'kay.
Project Manager: I really like that kinetic battery though.
Marketing: Next, is it easy to use? Just so you know, easy to learn will be separate,
Project Manager: Mm'kay.
Marketing: so don't overlap them.
Industrial Designer: Okay.
Marketing: I think it's really easy to use. I'll give it a two.
Industrial Designer: Um I'll give it a one. Pretty hard to mess up.
User Interface: I'll say one.
Project Manager: {vocalsound} Uh let's say two.
Marketing: Alright. Um we next wanna see if it has a spongy quality
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Marketing: and {vocalsound} if indeed it's made of latex or rubber I {disfmarker} it's spongy all the way. {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Give it a one.
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
Marketing: Yeah.
User Interface: I wonder if it bounces when you drop it.
Industrial Designer: Ooh, that you couldn't {disfmarker}
Marketing: Mm-hmm.
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: it'd be harder to break,
Project Manager: Mm.
Industrial Designer: harder to lose. {vocalsound}
User Interface: Yeah.
Project Manager:'Cause there would be less impact maybe, {vocalsound}.
Industrial Designer: Mm.
User Interface: Yeah
Marketing: Iain, what do you give it?
User Interface: I'd I'd give it a one.
Marketing: Alright and the next is, does it integrate some notion of fruits and vegetables {vocalsound}?
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
User Interface: Uh um {vocalsound}.
Marketing: Well, is it gonna be yellow?
Industrial Designer: It it might be,'cause that's our corporate colour, isn't it?
Project Manager: That's right, yeah, corporate colour, we didn't keep that in {disfmarker}
User Interface: Yeah.
Project Manager: um well
Industrial Designer: We might wanna keep it yellow.
Project Manager: if we {disfmarker} I know it would make it a little less c a little more confusing, but if we had all the buttons in black, and a design in {disfmarker} and the outside in yellow, that'd be our corporate one and we could also have alternative colours, one a more conservative one, one that's more fruity.
User Interface: {gap}
Marketing: Yeah, but if you had like a silvery kind of white or something.
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
User Interface: Yeah, {gap} {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Um and can we have like an R_R_ inscribed on the bottom or something?
Industrial Designer: If we had a yellow {disfmarker} Sure.
Project Manager: Okay.
User Interface: Yeah.
Marketing: Oh, yeah.
Project Manager: Fruity, so fruity.
Industrial Designer: So {vocalsound}
Marketing: Alright, so I think it it's {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: it was inspired by the potato, so I think it's pretty fruity.
Marketing: Yeah.
Project Manager: I think i it's kind of mangoey too.
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: Oh, mango
User Interface: Mangoey is better, yeah.
Marketing: Yeah.
Project Manager: Yes.
Marketing: I {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: that that {vocalsound} {disfmarker}
User Interface: I like mangoes {vocalsound}.
Marketing: okay, I'm giving it a one {vocalsound} the mango {gap} put me over.
Project Manager: Mm.
Industrial Designer: That's a much more trendy than a potato {vocalsound}
Marketing: {vocalsound} What are {disfmarker} what's everyone's numbers?
Industrial Designer: one.
User Interface: Uh two.
Project Manager: One.
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Marketing: Alright um, and does the design match the appropriate behaviour? Remember earlier we discussed that people don't use a lot of buttons, that they use the channel flipping and the volume the most. I think we really took that into account a lot, so I'm gonna give it a one.
Project Manager: Mm-hmm.
Industrial Designer: Yeah, me too.
User Interface: Uh one.
Marketing: Did you say one, Rose?
Project Manager: Yes.
Marketing: Okay um, also we talked earlier about R_S_I_ and wanting to prevent um any sort of like Carpal Tunnely kind of thing. Do we think that the latex sort of grip appropriately takes that into account? I think I'll give it a two,'cause I almost feel like no matter what you do, something is gonna happen.
Project Manager: It's gonna be hard.
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
User Interface: Yeah, yeah.
Project Manager: And if it's repetitive movement it is gonna be only four buttons that you're constantly pushing, but um {disfmarker}
Marketing: Um um worth the risk, I think.
Project Manager: I like how it fits in the hand though so I I'd go with a two.
Industrial Designer: Yeah. I'll I'll say two as well. Because older people that aren't used to like texting with the thumb might find it a bit at first,
Project Manager: Mm.
Marketing:'Kay.
Industrial Designer: but {disfmarker}
User Interface: Yeah I'll I'll say two.
Marketing: {vocalsound} Alright, awesome. And the ease of learning it. I know you were saying that you're a little bit nervous about that, I dunno. It sort of reminds me of the iPod. I just got mine, I still haven't read the instruction book and I'm doing okay, so {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Mm.
Marketing: and I'm not good at learning technology. So I'll give it a two.
Industrial Designer: The menu system and the the fact that multiple buttons are used for different things might be a bit confusing, but I think if it's one it's one of those things that it might take you five minutes to figure out, but you'll have it afterwards.
Project Manager: Mm-hmm.
Industrial Designer: So I'd I think I'd give it a two I guess.
User Interface: I think it it's probably a little harder then most remotes to learn, because you have to you have to use the menu system and you have to tell it what your favourite channels are
Industrial Designer: Oh, good point.
User Interface: and that could take a bit of learning at first, but
Marketing: Mm-hmm.
User Interface: once you've, yeah once you'd learned how to use it, I think it is a lot easier. So I'd I'd give it a four.
Marketing: Okay.
Project Manager: I think I'd give it a four too. It's a pretty high learning curve, it'll be easy once you've done it, but {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
User Interface: Yeah.
Marketing: Mm-hmm. Alright, um also earlier we had something about losing it and so now we're not addressing that at all, so {disfmarker}
Project Manager: We we {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: I think we can kind of say we addressed it with colour, but {disfmarker}
Marketing: Okay, so in terms of not losing it, do you think that on a scale of one to seven, how easy or hard is it to lose? I'm gonna I'm gonna give it a four,'cause I think that you can still {disfmarker} if it's in between somewhere where you can't see it, you're kind of not gonna find it,
Project Manager: Mm-hmm.
Marketing: but anywhere else it's gonna stand out.
User Interface: Yeah.
Industrial Designer: Um I'd say I'd give it uh a three, I guess it depends on how tidy you are normally.
Project Manager: Mm I'd give it a four.
User Interface: Um I'll give it a five'cause i it would be easy to lose something like that, yeah.
Project Manager: Small too.
Marketing: Alright, we also said simplicity, {vocalsound} how w how well does it address just being simple?
Industrial Designer: Simple to use or simple in design? Do you know?
Marketing: I think overall,'cause we had said before our two main things were simplicity and fashion,
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Marketing: so those are the next two things we're gonna look at. Separate from fancy, like that sort of thing.
Industrial Designer: Right.
Marketing: Um it like wants to be simple but it's not like totally totally simple, so I'm gonna give it a two.
Industrial Designer: I'm {gap} give it a three I guess.
User Interface: I'll give it a two.
Project Manager: Three.
Marketing: Alright, and fashionable?
Project Manager: It's totally fashionable. I'd give it a one.
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Marketing: It's hot, I mean it's a mango, come on.
Project Manager: Mango.
Marketing: {vocalsound} I mean how fashionable can you make a remote? I think it's bringing technology and fashion together real really well.
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} I dunno.
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: I don't think it's quite as fashionable as my robot remote
Project Manager: I do like uh the little Martian one. {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: or alien or whatever he was.
Marketing: Yeah, the toggle on off switch, it's really appealing.
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Marketing: {vocalsound} Number.
Industrial Designer: Um two.
User Interface: Three.
Project Manager: One.
Marketing: And does it meet our like demographic need sort of for international appeal, that whole thing? Just that it would se serve our audience. I don't see why not.
Project Manager: Mm-hmm. I think as long {disfmarker} if we offer in a {disfmarker} in at least three different colour arrangements. Um yeah, that's good.
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
Marketing: Mm-hmm.
Project Manager: So I'll give it a a two {gap}.
Industrial Designer: Yeah, I'll say two.
Marketing: Alright, did anyone have any other features that they think were important that we didn't talk about?
Project Manager: Well um we didn't we didn't address the fact that it does need to b have a corporate logo, so let's let's make sure we keep that in mind that we ha that one of our colours concepts is corporate and has an R_R_ on it.
Industrial Designer: Shall we uh {disfmarker} Well I think all of them should have an R_R_.
Project Manager: All of them should have R_R_, yeah.
Marketing: And so we're gonna do that, so it will address it,
Project Manager: Mm-hmm. Mm'kay.
Marketing: fine. Okay.
Project Manager: Lovely.
Marketing: That's me.
Project Manager: Okay, now we're gonna look at finances. Um I have an Excel sheet that we're actually gonna calculate the cost um, so let me exit out of this first. Okay um {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Oh my. {vocalsound}
Marketing: Whoa.
Project Manager: I know. Let me {gap} one more space. Gonna zoom in real quick. {gap} Okay. Hand dynamo. We're using kinetic battery,
Industrial Designer: Uh we're n using kinetic, yeah.
Project Manager: right? Um and we're having one per {disfmarker} One, okay.
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
Project Manager: Um electronics.
Industrial Designer: Single.
Project Manager: Simple.
Industrial Designer: Simple, simple rather.
Marketing: Simple.
Project Manager: Mm'kay. Um the case.
Industrial Designer: Uh uh uh double-curved.
User Interface: Guess it's double-curved. It is pretty curvy.
Project Manager: It's very curvy,
Marketing: Yeah.
Project Manager: so okay. {gap}
Industrial Designer: Yeah I never did get a picture of those so I don't really know. Our case material supplements {disfmarker} oops, we just skipped by them.
Marketing: Well don't we need plastic, and {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: No, we we {disfmarker} the plastic is the plastic for the inside is assumed. The supplement is {disfmarker}
Marketing: Provided, okay.
Project Manager: The wood?
Industrial Designer: Oh, I guess it was rubber rather than latex.
Project Manager: I mean the rubber.
Marketing: It was rubber and special colour, right?
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
Project Manager: Mm-hmm, okay.
Marketing: Do we have more than one special colour?
Project Manager: Yeah, we're using {disfmarker} we're gonna need at least two special colours.
Industrial Designer: Uh well {disfmarker}
User Interface: Special colours, isn't it?
Project Manager: Um.
Industrial Designer: I don't know what the se the basic colour is though.
Marketing: Per {disfmarker}
Project Manager: I dunno where it {disfmarker} yeah.
Marketing: Well, but we know that we're having at least three colours,
Project Manager: So let's y say three.
Marketing: so {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Well, are we talking about on each colour combination or are we, you know, we'll {disfmarker} like we'll have yellow and black. Is that two special colours?
Project Manager: Yeah, I dunno. That I thi
Industrial Designer: Or or is white and black, then two more or {vocalsound} {disfmarker}
Project Manager: I thought that would be under yours.
Industrial Designer: Uh. I guess it's three,
Project Manager: We'll just say three.
Industrial Designer: three three {gap}.
Project Manager: Mm-hmm.
Marketing: Right.
Project Manager: Maybe the R_R_ will be in colour as well,
Industrial Designer: Alright.
Project Manager: so yeah. Interface, we're doing push buttons. And how many buttons do we have?
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
Marketing: We have six.
User Interface: We've got five {gap}.
Project Manager: Six.
Industrial Designer: Six, with the power.
User Interface: Oh {gap}
Marketing: Oh
User Interface: six.
Marketing: no, five. {gap}
Project Manager: Anything else?
Industrial Designer: Yeah. No. Oh, we'll {disfmarker} do we wa Are the buttons in special colour, special f I didn't get information on {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Oh,
Marketing: Oh wait.
Project Manager: buttons {disfmarker} oh, so um. So the case material will just have one colour, right,
Industrial Designer: Well,
Project Manager: but then the buttons will be in special colours?
Industrial Designer: does it {disfmarker}
Marketing: Yeah.
Industrial Designer: but if we're making multiple varieties of {disfmarker} this is where I'm getting confused.
Project Manager: We're saying per unit.
Industrial Designer: {gap} per unit, okay, okay.
Marketing: Yeah, per unit.
Project Manager: Okay, so each unit will only have one colour on their {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Alright, and each button s
Project Manager: but the case is {disfmarker} could have up to thr I mean the buttons could ea could be up to three colours,'cause that how it's designed there.
Marketing: Yeah.
User Interface: Yeah.
Marketing: I like it like that.
Project Manager: So {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Yeah, okay.
Project Manager: Special form? They're all kind of just push button,
Industrial Designer: No,
Project Manager: right?
Industrial Designer: I think they're fine.
User Interface: Yeah.
Project Manager: Special material?
Industrial Designer: Material, we want them rubber as well probably, yeah.
Project Manager: Uh. Oh do {disfmarker} I have to do it per button, do I?
Industrial Designer: No, I don't think so. I think they're {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Okay.
Industrial Designer: if they're all gonna be rubber then it {disfmarker} that's what it matters.
Marketing: Yeah,'cause it wouldn't make sense otherwise,
Project Manager: Yeah.
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
Marketing:'cause for the whole mat case material it's only one.
Project Manager: Mm-hmm.
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
Marketing: It's {disfmarker} I mean it's two to make it rubber.
Industrial Designer: Okay.
Marketing: Oh wait, so maybe.
Project Manager: Thirteen point seven.
Marketing: {gap}
Industrial Designer: Oh oh.
Project Manager: Yeah, what can we reduce?
Industrial Designer: Okay, let's have our buttons all be one colour.
Marketing: Mm, I kind of like the buttons.
Project Manager: Let's see what that would do. It's only gonna bring us down to thirteen point three anyway.
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} Alright.
Project Manager: Okay um, are we sure this is double-curved?
Industrial Designer: Uh.
Project Manager: Maybe it's single-curved,
Industrial Designer: We have no idea.
Project Manager: we have no idea.
Industrial Designer: I dunno, I didn't get any pictures. {vocalsound} It's single curved.
Marketing: It's single curved.
Industrial Designer: Why not?
Project Manager: Well it's not the {disfmarker} yeah. Okay, it's the kinetic battery that's kind of expensive, but we have a simple chip, single curve,
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: case material is rubber and it's a special colour,
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
Project Manager: but that's important. Six buttons {disfmarker} we have to have six buttons.
Industrial Designer: That is important. How did it get more expensive, what did you just change?
Project Manager: What?
Industrial Designer: It was it was thirteen and now it's fifteen.
Project Manager: No, okay, maybe not. I don't know what just happened. Now it's twelve.
Marketing: We
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
User Interface: What was our target price again?
Project Manager: Twelve point five.
Industrial Designer: Twelve point five. Hey hey.
User Interface: Twelve point five. So we're just just about there.
Project Manager: So we're okay, I think.
Industrial Designer: We're all set then.
Project Manager: Yeah.
Marketing: {gap}
Industrial Designer: Ish.
Project Manager: Okay, we're all set.
Industrial Designer: Alright.
Project Manager: Um save. I saved that to our um our big shared folder, so you know. Um okay, back to agenda. {vocalsound} Um are the {disfmarker} are the costs under twelve fifty Euro? Yes.
Industrial Designer: Yes.
User Interface: Yeah.
Marketing: Yeah, they are.
Project Manager: Let's move on to the project evaluation. Project process. Satisfaction with for example the room for creativity, leadership, teamwork, the means, any new ideas found. So I guess what we're gonna talk about here is just evaluating how we created this project, the information we got on the news, how we used it, if we were able to um, you know, use our creativity with the information, um how how well I guess I led it, um the {disfmarker} how well we worked together as a team, um the digital pens, the whiteboard.
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Okay.
Industrial Designer: Well. I felt very creative. {vocalsound}
User Interface: {vocalsound} I think we've been successful
Industrial Designer: I enjoyed making the prototypes.
User Interface: in that we've achieved almost all of the design goals that we've set {gap}
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
User Interface: and we've come up with a finished project and we just about got {gap} cost.
Industrial Designer: I think we could've done even better with a little bit more information,
Project Manager: Mm-hmm.
Industrial Designer: like what's a single-curved case, how many colours, what do colours count
Project Manager: Mm-hmm.
Industrial Designer: things, but given given what we had I think that we did we did really well. Um I think we worked together pretty well.
User Interface: Yeah.
Marketing: Yeah, I mean {vocalsound} if I'd had more market research on the {gap} fruits and vegetables, maybe we could've taken that into account.
Project Manager: Mm-hmm.
Industrial Designer: Yeah {gap}.
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} But the fruits and vegetables, they really {gap} my creativity, so.
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
Marketing: I know, I really did, the the whole mango idea was great.
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} Do you think we could {disfmarker}
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Marketing: No, I mean I thought the pen was a little distracting for me personally, like its heaviness, and like just being so conscious of like turning the pages, I dunno. That was a bit of a distraction.
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
Marketing: That was the last one, like I chose not to do a PowerPoint'cause I didn't think it made sense to, so I liked that I had the option to do that and just to take my own notes and that whole sort of thing.
Project Manager: Mm-hmm. I think we all made um very significant contributions,
User Interface: Yeah.
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: I don't think anybody dominated it, which I thought was really good, like each of us was able to um like each of you had your information and I uh I tried to facilitate it without like taking over, um {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
Project Manager: I like our little finished products.
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} Can we market this as the mango remote?
Marketing: {vocalsound} They're funny.
Project Manager: Really cute.
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Marketing: I kind of want one.
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: Should we have that somewhere on the packaging? I have a little R_R_.
Marketing: I'm trying to think of a good pun that I could add there {gap}.
Project Manager: I know,
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: let's think of it like a little jingle.
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Um.
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Marketing: I like the R_R_, that's gonna be etched in.
Industrial Designer: Yes. Hopefully not with just my fingernail at some point but um it's quite a useful little gadget. All thanks to Iain for the design of that one.
Project Manager: {gap}. Okay um
Industrial Designer: Mm. What did we find for new ideas?
Project Manager: new ideas found?
Industrial Designer: People should really base their remotes on fruits and vegetables.
Project Manager: Definitely. Or or at least be c p creative enough to think of toggle switches mm
User Interface: Yeah.
Project Manager: etcetera.
Industrial Designer: I I am really into the idea of kinetic batteries now after reading about them.
Project Manager: Oh, I'm so excited.
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: That was {disfmarker}
Marketing: Yeah, I didn't even know they existed.
Industrial Designer: I I knew you can get watches that had them, like really quite expensive watches that just never need a battery,'cause you're always moving your wrist.
Project Manager: Mm-hmm.
Industrial Designer: But in other things, I think it'd be really good.
Project Manager: I thi yeah, that's awesome. Um okay, closing. Are the costs within the budget? Is the project evaluated?
Industrial Designer: Yes.
Project Manager: Now there's the final questionnaire and meeting summary. Um so, this is the great product kids, I think we've created something really interesting and that we have a market for it, um especially if we can produce it at twelve point three
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
Project Manager: which we hope um {disfmarker} yeah. Make sure in your questionnaire to put down criticisms of both the process and the um the final results and {disfmarker} {vocalsound}.
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Marketing: Yeah, Real Reaction.
Project Manager: {vocalsound} I do like the Martian remote.
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: If we could choose more than one, that would be my second choice.
Marketing: Oh, that would definitely be my second choice.
Project Manager: Although the tog toggle
User Interface: Mm.
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: I'm afraid I would {disfmarker}
User Interface: That's cool. Let's all let's all go for the yellow {gap} {disfmarker}
Marketing: I would break it. {vocalsound} I would break it.
Project Manager: It's cool. I think I would break it.
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} It started because I wanted to have it as st as a stem
User Interface: Break the stem off.
Industrial Designer: and then {vocalsound} {disfmarker} alright, so {disfmarker}
Marketing: Oh that's funny {vocalsound}.
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Is {disfmarker} it started as a pear, but then it started looking more and more like a Martian
Project Manager: {vocalsound} Oh
Industrial Designer: when I put the {disfmarker}
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Marketing: Kind of looks like a penguin, like {vocalsound} with no eye {vocalsound}.
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} Take me to your leader. {vocalsound}
Project Manager: yeah, it's kind of a penguin.
Industrial Designer: {gap}
Marketing: I like that it stands up.
Project Manager: Mm-mm.
Industrial Designer: Wow, maybe I should market it to some remote control company now.
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: So are are {disfmarker} {vocalsound}
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
User Interface: {vocalsound} That was bound to happen. $
Marketing: {vocalsound} Oh, sad.
Industrial Designer: poor little thing. {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Mm'kay, congratulations. Um. Anything else to say?
Marketing: Nothing will come up until after our meeting's supposed to be over,
Project Manager: Alright.
Marketing: its all timed.
Project Manager: Um anybody have {disfmarker} {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: Oh.
Marketing: Oh. {vocalsound}
Project Manager: I got more master classes, anybody else wanna like take a master's class?
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} It's really funny that you got spam in your work emails.
Marketing: {vocalsound}
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Yeah, but check it out. So like there are all these like links, they don't go anywhere.
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: But all that you need to keep in mind your {gap} knowledge management. Um just wanna make sure you do.
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} {vocalsound}
Marketing: {vocalsound} No the first one that you sent like I didn't realise that it was a joke and I was like why did she send this to us?
Project Manager: {vocalsound} Oh {gap}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Marketing: It's very it's very work relevant,
Project Manager: It is.
Marketing:'cause people send spam a lot.
Project Manager: Yes definitely {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Let's see,
Project Manager: I'm very sad that I didn't get any links to the corporate website. {gap}.
Marketing: Oh here you can you can view.
Industrial Designer: what did I get through the corporate website? It's just inspiration about circuit boards.
Marketing: You can just see what's up.
Project Manager: Wow.
Marketing: Yeah it's it's really deep. Hold on. Takes a little while to get excited to load. That {disfmarker} the Excel thing is pretty cool.
Project Manager: Yes.
Industrial Designer: Yeah, that is pretty neat.
Project Manager: I love Excel,
Marketing: Here, like, basically
Project Manager: it's one of my favourite programs.
Marketing: it's like inspiration, basically I'm gonna give you two sentences on fashion and that kind of thing, see. You didn't miss out that much.
Project Manager: I see, mm.
Industrial Designer: Yeah, my inspiration from from last time is the in interior of a remote control being taken apart bit by bit, talking about circuit boards.
Project Manager: Spongy.
Industrial Designer: I learned a lot actually.
User Interface: Mm.
Industrial Designer: I could probably take apart a remote control now if I really needed to.
Marketing: Oh wow. This one was cooler. I got a whole table and everything.
Industrial Designer: Now I have all about circuits and chips and transponders and {disfmarker} I wrote it all down, because I thought it would be relevant, like all the different parts of the inside of a remote control, but then they're like, you don't actually need this {disfmarker} you just need to talk about the case.
Marketing: That's like mine it was like, would you prefer an L_C_D_ screen or a multifunction remote control? And then it didn't have like any kind of table, like awesome, I'm glad they asked that question and didn't report the result {vocalsound}.
Project Manager: I I thought it was a little tricky having to hand around this thing.
Industrial Designer: It's really interesting though. Yeah.
User Interface: Yeah.
Marketing: Yeah.
Project Manager: We had a lot of the um {disfmarker} otherwise the technology {gap} today was kinda cool.
User Interface: I think. Yeah.
Industrial Designer: That was really neat how I got emails
Project Manager: Mm-hmm.
Industrial Designer: and {disfmarker}
User Interface: We didn't we didn't use the whiteboard that much.
Project Manager: No.
Industrial Designer: No.
Project Manager: Although I don't see how we could have very l at least for me
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: I {disfmarker} yeah. If I'd gotten pictures of the different parts of the case, the different looks of the case, I would have probably drawn them up,
Project Manager: Mm.
Industrial Designer: but {disfmarker}
Marketing:'Cause we weren't like voting on anything and I think usually, like whiteboards are good, you know like crossing out ideas, or like if we had had like a brainstorming period.
Industrial Designer: Yeah, we could've put our brainstorming stuff up there rather than just talking about it,
Project Manager: Mm-hmm.
Industrial Designer: but with only four people it doesn't really make sense.
Marketing: But I thought we were good orally.
Project Manager: And with and with the PowerPoint that we can all look at, like you can do all those things pretty much on PowerPoint
Industrial Designer: I think if you had a larger group {disfmarker}
Marketing: Get crazy.
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
Project Manager: as that's not as necessary to have.
User Interface: Yeah.
Marketing: And these might've made us more willing to like take notes than to like write up them here,
Project Manager: Mm.
Marketing:'cause we all needed them separately, kind of on the whiteboards in this room.
Project Manager: Mm-hmm.
Industrial Designer: Because we're all gonna be working in different places.
Marketing: {gap} Yeah.
Industrial Designer: We {disfmarker} if we were all gonna stay in here all the time, then having the notes up on the whiteboard would've been alright,
Project Manager: Mm-hmm.
Industrial Designer: but everyone needs their own, like specific notes, I guess.
Project Manager: Now when you were um creating your um prototypes here, did you work together or did you like do separate projects?
User Interface: Uh we we worked together,
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
User Interface: um but we were making like we sort of made different shapes and then discussed how the how the buttons might work,
Project Manager: Mm-hmm.
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
User Interface: um and how we could like improve on the on the design.
Industrial Designer: So it was a bit of both really, we just kind of started out by each taking a colour of clay and just fooling around with it and I came up with that rhombus shape
Project Manager: Mm-hmm.
Industrial Designer: and he came up with the sort of potatoey, mangoey shape, and then just went from there really.
Project Manager: Cool.
Industrial Designer: It was fun. {vocalsound} {vocalsound} So well done with the management, I felt well managed.
Project Manager: Oh thanks.
User Interface: I think we did well in first of all giving our meetings the time,
Project Manager: It's kinda fun.
User Interface: and second we actually we we did a good job of making firm decisions at the ends of the meetings.
Project Manager: Mm.
User Interface: And I {disfmarker} {vocalsound}
Marketing: Sorry. {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} That happened to me all the time though.
User Interface: I know what happens sometimes is that you tend to sort of have meetings and then people sorta drift away without anything actually really being decided.
Project Manager: Mm-hmm.
User Interface: But I think here we got we got clear and and decisive decisive points {gap} at the end of the meetings, so that we we knew where to go on from there.
Industrial Designer: Yeah, I was quite worried at the end of the last meeting that we weren't getting {disfmarker} we didn't really have enough information to make firm decisions,
Project Manager: Mm-hmm.
Industrial Designer: but we were able to do it regardless, so. I'm not usually a very decisive person, so it helped to have people say this needs to be done in five minutes.
Project Manager: This is what we'll do.
User Interface: Yeah.
Project Manager: I found that we did {disfmarker} we could have used another five or ten minutes sometimes in the meetings.
Industrial Designer: Especially last time,
User Interface: Yeah, for some of the meetings, yeah.
Project Manager: Mm-hmm.
Industrial Designer: yeah.
Project Manager: Yeah I think the last time we had a lot of information, but at the same time not quite enough,
Industrial Designer: Yeah, {gap} {disfmarker}
Project Manager: you know what I mean,
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
Project Manager: like we we couldn't answer every single question.
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
User Interface: Yeah.
Project Manager: {vocalsound} Um but {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Right. And I I felt the first two meetings, that I was coming in with no information,
Project Manager: Mm.
Industrial Designer: and not sort of made me really like, ooh I don't know {vocalsound}, throwing together PowerPoint out of no no information and then last time it was like the opposite. I had so much information and so much to talk about.
Project Manager: It was interesting what came out like later, like as I was doing the {disfmarker} when I was doing the breakdown on the agenda that they gave me um, that more points came out from your presentation even.
Industrial Designer: Yeah. Mm.
Project Manager: Um. I'm a little {disfmarker} I am a little disappointed that we didn't do a {disfmarker} um something for losing the remote, because that was kind of a big point.
Industrial Designer: Yeah. {gap} that was something like {disfmarker} in order to talk about that we would've had to have actual knowledge about circuit boards and {vocalsound} things like {disfmarker}
Project Manager: About {disfmarker} yeah.
User Interface: Yeah.
Marketing: Well the problem was, even when we just were creating from the Excel file, there wasn't like a option to select to somehow have it included,
Project Manager: Mm-hmm.
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
Marketing: so there was no {disfmarker} we could be like yeah, it has it included.
Industrial Designer: I think we were {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Mm-hmm.
Marketing: There was no way for us to have
Project Manager: Considered the re
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
Marketing: written down that it was really there.
Project Manager: yeah.
Industrial Designer: I think we were just getting overenthusiastic with the task {vocalsound}.
Project Manager: Well
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: it's interesting that they {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: I think we really got into it, I mean I got into it as the day went on and I got really like, ooh I'm designing a remote control, I dunno if that's just me,
Project Manager: Mm-hmm, yeah {gap}.
Industrial Designer: but {disfmarker}
Project Manager: It was interesting though that they put that fifty percent of people say they have frustration with losing their remote and yet they didn't provide us with information to um {disfmarker} we weren't provided with information to discuss that.
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
Marketing: Yeah.
Project Manager: I know that like people people have like things they can put on their keys that you press it and it'll beep, but I but I'm sure that would require some kind of technology
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
User Interface: Yeah.
Project Manager: that {disfmarker} I just don't know what it is, but {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: I think there are some of those like infomercial remotes that have things so you won't lose them.
Project Manager: Mm.
Industrial Designer: I dunno. I mean we were talking about it and like i in my household at least, there's only about two places that the remote is ever
Project Manager: Hmm.
Industrial Designer:'cause there's only one T_V_ and there's only like three chairs.
Marketing: That's like saying you're never gonna lose your keys, and I always do, anyway. You'll lose'em in your pocket,
Project Manager: Mm-hmm.
Marketing: like you just will forget that {disfmarker} or you like put it down somewhere that like made sense and then not remember,
Project Manager: Mm.
Marketing: there's always ways to lose things.
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
Project Manager: It d yeah, it depends on how organised you are personally, but {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Yeah, or like I guess what the setup of the house is too.
Project Manager: Mm-hmm.
Industrial Designer: But, I mean {disfmarker} I am notorious for losing my keys,
Project Manager: {vocalsound} {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: I just {disfmarker} I guess I've just never lost the remote. I put my keys in the refrigerator the other night {vocalsound} and couldn't find them.
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer:'Cause I was putting groceries away.
Marketing: That's funny.
Project Manager: {vocalsound} Oh.
Industrial Designer: You you're taking stuff from a bag and putting them in the refrigerator and then go back to my room.
Project Manager: Can't get in. {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: Can't get in, look all around the kitchen. Definitely in the vegetable drawer.
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
Marketing: That's funny.
Industrial Designer: So {vocalsound}.
Marketing: I always do that, leaving it in my coat, and then like using a different coat.
Industrial Designer: Mm.
Project Manager: Yep.
Industrial Designer: But I guess it's'cause we don't carry remotes around that much.
Marketing: Yeah. Can't really take it into the other room.
Industrial Designer: Yeah. Maybe with our little robot one we could've had him have a {disfmarker} robot, alien, pear, whatever he is, have a little voice like, I am located {disfmarker}
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: Oh a G_P_S_ system, {vocalsound} internal G_P_S_.
Marketing: {vocalsound}
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Marketing: Oh man. Here you go.
Project Manager: {vocalsound} We should make one that walks by itself. {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: Although if it's sitting still for too long. {vocalsound} Yes I {disfmarker}
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Marketing: That really could get up and walk away {vocalsound}.
Project Manager: Or or like some crazy like electro-magnet, that you push it and it'll go zoom to the T_V_ and stick there. {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} {gap} Or little {disfmarker} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Or just just a wheel, you know.
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: Just if you {disfmarker} {vocalsound} like you'd have a remote for your remote, that'll {gap}. {vocalsound}
User Interface: {vocalsound} Yeah.
Project Manager: Well, but if you could attach them to the T_V_, then you can {gap}.
Industrial Designer: {gap} zoom {disfmarker} Yeah. Hmm. All kinds of possibilities.
Project Manager: Mm. Okay. Sorry, I'm just um trying to update my minutes. I decided to {disfmarker} you know how I sent you the email saying that PowerPoint minutes will be complimentary, rather than like repeating them.
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
Project Manager: Just gonna make {disfmarker} I'm making full minutes, so that it'll include all of the agenda and all that.
Industrial Designer: Oh.
Project Manager:'Cause that seems a little more useful.
Industrial Designer: Wow.'Cause you've had like the most typing and organising to do.
Project Manager: But I didn't have like information to sloth through either, so {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Yeah, I guess {disfmarker} How much of your PowerPoint was already done for you, every meeting.
Project Manager: Most of it, mm-hmm. I added slides, um I added a couple slides each time,
Industrial Designer: Oh.
Project Manager: but that was about it.
Industrial Designer: Okay. Yeah, I didn't even think about adding slides,'cause I would just get slides with titles on them
Project Manager: Mm.
Industrial Designer: and fill them all in w didn't even think about adding more.
Project Manager: Well, the thing was they would provide y an agenda with s like several points, but it wouldn't have a slide for each point. And that's the only way I remember that I need to go other that point.
Industrial Designer: Ah yeah. .
Project Manager: {gap} I know personally when I do PowerPoint, that's what I do and so {disfmarker} I had it once, even if it was just like the title of it, like the three presentations, and I would do your three.
Industrial Designer: Right.
Marketing: You have you have to have the slogan on it or can it just be like {disfmarker}
Project Manager: The slogan on it?
Industrial Designer: No, no, definitely not.
Project Manager: No no no.
Marketing: Okay good.
Industrial Designer: We {vocalsound} {disfmarker}
Marketing: {vocalsound}'Cause I was like, it could go around the outside. {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} No, I don't think we need to {disfmarker}
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: I think we just need the um the R_R_,
Industrial Designer: I think the R_ and R_, especially if the yellow and black one.
Project Manager: yeah.
Marketing: Is it yellow and blue?
Industrial Designer: Or yellow and blue. Lemme go to the web page.
Project Manager: Yeah, I was just kinda going by the web page,'cause they didn't give me any clear, like yellow, grey, or {gap}.
Marketing: Oh I guess it is black, grey. Grey is better than black, doesn't look so bumblebeeish.
Project Manager: I don't really like yellow in general.
Marketing: Hey now I understand the random like newsclippings.
Project Manager: But it {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Finish meeting now. {vocalsound}
Marketing: {gap}
Project Manager: Wasn't it interesting that um {disfmarker} I thought it was interesting that our market marketing um expert did not agree with the marketing um
Marketing: {vocalsound} Yes.
Project Manager: the marketing choices,
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: you know, like
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Marketing: I will
Project Manager: {vocalsound} that was a bit of a conflict.
Marketing: I just feel like if you're really doing like a a really big market evaluation, you wouldn't just have like one set of source,
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Marketing: it's kind of an {disfmarker} they were so not backed up, it would just be a sentence {gap} like we did a survey, this is what people said.
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
Marketing: S mm, I dunno.
Project Manager: People are stupid.
Industrial Designer: I guess it i it sort of a grey, isn't it? Yellow and grey, but then the slogan's in blue.
Marketing: Well we got some grey and we got some blue buttons, we're good.
Industrial Designer: Yeah. Well we don't have the right colour clay anyway.
Project Manager: Maybe, like {disfmarker} I don't know. {gap} That could always be {gap}.
Industrial Designer: Well we're not, sadly, going to actually be producing this, so {vocalsound}.
Project Manager: Oh.
Marketing: If they ever come out with potato {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} Potato mango shaped remotes.
Marketing: I'm gonna have to {disfmarker}
Project Manager: I'm claiming it intellectual property.
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Marketing: Yeah.
Industrial Designer: I can't believe a whole day is gone. I don't feel like it's been that long.
Marketing: I know.
Industrial Designer: Get sucked in. Mm I haven't gotten questionnaire eight yet.","This meeting was about the prototype presentation and evaluation. Firstly, the group presented the prototype with agreed features including a latex case in fruity colours that's curved, push buttons with an on-screen menu button as well as eight extra buttons. Next, the group had a discussion about the prototype evaluation. They gave a high scale of the score on creativity, ease of use, integration of fruits as well as the simplicity. Also, they gave an average score on technology innovation and ease of learning. Then, the group agreed to set the target price at 12. 5 Euros. Lastly, the group had a discussion about the project process, including management and leadership as well as group mates'personal learning.",qmsum
"Summarize the whole meeting.
Project Manager: Hi Kate. {vocalsound} Okay, carry on.
Industrial Designer: Just just carry on. {vocalsound}
Project Manager: {vocalsound} Alright um this is the beginning of the third meeting, the conceptual design meeting. Um our agenda should be um that we're opening the meeting, I have {disfmarker} the minutes from the previous meeting are on the shared f drive at this point. Um and we should each have a presentation to make. Um we have certain decisions to make and we have forty minutes total. It's twenty five after two at the moment, so forty minutes is five after three, {vocalsound} um which I'll be keeping an eye on the clock for us. Okay. {vocalsound} Um there are the decisions we have to turn to, but we'll come back to them in a minute after I take us to the minutes of the previous meeting. Right um as we remember, I opened the meeting, the four of us were present, the meeting {disfmarker} the first meeting's minutes were reviewed and approved. Um Sarah, you presented a marketing research report um which pretty much rep represented that fifteen to thirty five year olds uh it has to be hand-held, power, channel, volume, number keys, possibly a speech recognition. And then Steph did a second presentation um that those functions plus streamlining them with big user-friendly keys that were easy to use. I think all of us agreed with those things. Kate presented a working design of {disfmarker} going after {disfmarker} going over the basics on the whiteboard um that it should be a simple mass-produced device, because of the twelve and a half Pence cost. Um but we did talk about possibly using rechargeable batteries and having a docking place as a selling point. Um and the new requirements that it for {disfmarker} be for T_V_ only um and that it include the l so slogan and colour of the uh corporate design be included. Um {vocalsound} the corporate image. So we agreed that the target market would be fifteen to thirty five with more money than sense, that were decision makers. Alternatively it would be a manufacturer to enclose it with the T_V_, but it still should meet those parameters. Um and that the function we agreed was volume, power, numbers, enter, channels, a way to move between channels, easy to use and hand-held. {vocalsound} Um at that point we agreed that Sarah would look at the current cost of competition, what what do the current ones sell for. Um and Steph was gonna look at ec ergonomics. Kate was gonna look at cost and feasibility of the various possibilities that we discussed. And I was to type up these minutes and work on the final report. Is this a fair presentation of what our last meeting was?
User Interface: Yeah.
Industrial Designer: Mm-hmm.
User Interface: Yes.
Project Manager: Okay. Right. So we're ready to close that and go back to our {disfmarker} That one. Right. We're up to the point of the {disfmarker} Go back. Um {vocalsound} the three presentations. So we're going to pull the plug on me and turn to Sarah. Is that okay? Is that alright with everybody else?
Industrial Designer: Mm-hmm. {vocalsound}
User Interface: Yep.
Project Manager: Especially since Kate asked to be last. {vocalsound} Sarah, I'm sorry if I misspelled your name, I didn't know whether it was S_A_R_A_ or {vocalsound} S_A_R_H_.
Marketing: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} I respond to either.
Project Manager: You respond to whatever you get, huh? {vocalsound}
Marketing: No worries.
Project Manager: Okay. Um, did you do your {disfmarker} Hit {disfmarker}
User Interface: Yeah, {gap}
Project Manager: Ah, there it is. Ta-da.
Marketing: Okay, first thing I want to address is um one of the points that Florence brought up, which was uh current cost of the competition devices, similar to the ones that Stephanie uh showed us and and they're uh twenty to sixty Euros, depending on uh branding.
User Interface: Right.
Marketing: Some of them that have a higher brand recognition are on the more expensive end. But I think that with the current um price that we're searching for, we're well within, even on the lower end, of the uh of the market.
Project Manager: Mm'kay.
Marketing: But I'm going to move on to more interesting um {vocalsound} more vibrant things. {vocalsound} So, I investigated the remote control market in greater detail, and my uh {disfmarker} the theme of what I was to work on was uh trend watch.
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Marketing: And {vocalsound}
Project Manager:'Kay.
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} Sorry. {vocalsound}
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: I'm glad to see the marketing budget is being so well spent on {vocalsound} {gap}. {vocalsound}
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
Marketing: {vocalsound} I know that you all are a distance from cutting edge marketing research,
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Marketing: so you know, I'm just gonna try to cloak it in really professional terms here. What's hot, fruit and veg. Spongy.
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Marketing: And this is all over the catwalks, Paris, Milan, and I'm talking about clothing, furniture, shoes. {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Marketing: This is really interesting change from past years,
Project Manager: Mm.
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Marketing: because it is much more organic, um some would say approachable. {vocalsound} And I think if we're to refashion our view of what we want in a remote control, we should perhaps think about incorporating technologically interesting fabrics and some of the bold colours into a simple handset. So. {vocalsound} I also did a little research on um {vocalsound} what again are the most important priorities in uh decision making about uh purchasing. Fancy. Functional is out. And f the fancy, and that's exactly the term, I'm I'm thinking polished, elegant, {vocalsound} you know, kind of innovative, but a cut above. This is twice as important as the next finding, which is technologically innovative. This is interesting,'cause I think in the last meeting we were talking about technology as being so important, but maybe what's innovative is having it simple with um with uh technologically {vocalsound} superior fabrics or uh, you know, designed in interesting substances. Ease of use. Again, pretty low, I mean it's the top three, but each of the uh fancy and technologically innovative are far more important. So I think we should cloak the streamlined remote control device in a series of {vocalsound} fruit {vocalsound} fruit themed sleeves.
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} I think that's a good idea. Don't you? {vocalsound}
Marketing: {vocalsound} Y yeah, you know {disfmarker}
Project Manager: It sounds like the the uh covers that they use for the remote, you know, your t your cell phone.
User Interface: Yes.
Marketing: Exactly. {vocalsound} Exactly. I was thinking though that instead of having something uh like patterned, you know, so, you know, something similar to a summer dress. {gap} you know, it would have like fruit and veg, is that we actually make these spongy.
Project Manager: Mm.
Marketing: They could be {disfmarker} ini initially I thought we could start with kind of um fruit that would suit kind of uh a long uh hand-held, so banana, pineapple and pear. Um it could actually {disfmarker} the sleeve could {vocalsound} take up a lot of the {vocalsound} development and the remote control, we'd just need to get reductionist on it. {vocalsound}
User Interface: {vocalsound} {vocalsound}
Marketing: They could be interchangeable, they're spongy, that goes back to ergonomic, and the youngsters love'em, fun for the whole family, everyone can have their own. So what we're talking about is changing. this concept. Everyone has a T_V_ remote, but then we add in the fact that they could each have their own individual fruit.
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Marketing: {vocalsound} That's what's hot on the catwalks. {vocalsound} So, this is my {disfmarker} This is what I'm thinking.
Project Manager: Hmm.
User Interface: {vocalsound} {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Uh-huh mm. In most families, don't {disfmarker} isn't the remote {disfmarker} is a remote.
Marketing: Y yeah, but I think I think what this would allow is perhaps a person in the family who had the most opinion about it {disfmarker} we all need a remote,
Project Manager: Mm.
Marketing: but the person who is really perhaps active in personalising, I'm thinking the teenager, the {disfmarker} someone fifteen to thirty five would go out and get this additional thing the same way as you mentioned that people would get the cell phone covers.
User Interface: {vocalsound} So when your dad's sitting there, overriding your decision, going no we're gonna watch this, you can bring out your own remote and be like zap, no we're gonna watch this.
Marketing: {vocalsound} Yeah. W and {vocalsound} plus I think {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Mm. Well actually some households do have three and four T_V_s
Marketing: {vocalsound} Uh yeah.
User Interface: {gap}
Project Manager: and they would have a remote for each one,
Marketing: Yeah.
Project Manager: so.
Marketing: Yeah. So this is an idea and I I {disfmarker} you know, this is exactly what the research has uh has shown. So I really open this up to uh any other feedback. This {vocalsound} spongy fruit and veg.
Industrial Designer: Yeah, I I think we're gonna have some trouble when we get down to the component design on this.
Marketing: Thanks. {vocalsound} Alright.
Project Manager: Hmm.
Industrial Designer: Spongy is gonna be difficult, I'm afraid.
User Interface: Yep. {vocalsound} And as for as for um well budgeting as well, if we're gonna have lots of different interchangeable components.
Project Manager: Hmm. {vocalsound}
Marketing: {vocalsound} I I just have my ear to the market, guys. {gap} {disfmarker}
User Interface: {vocalsound} Is this {gap} to the market {gap}?
Industrial Designer: Yeah, I mean basically we can make these things out of wood, titanium, plastic or rubber. I suppose rubber is the closest to spongy,
Marketing: Is spongiest, yeah.
Industrial Designer: yeah.
Marketing: That would add {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: I was thinking titanium myself.
User Interface: I was thinking titanium, I was thinking it's just {disfmarker} I have been influenced by pictures of iPods, and they're also minimalist and shiny.
Marketing: Mm-hmm. {vocalsound} They are and they they would fulfil the uh first um priority, which is fancy. I think many of us would associate those with fancy. Something else we could do is uh call it something that's fruit and veg oriented. We could call it uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} The name.
Project Manager: Are we talking about the device itself or the c or a cover for the device that would be an interchangeable cov cover as a separate product?
Marketing: {vocalsound} Well it would be uh a a very simple product that would have a spongy sleeve that would be interchangeable. So {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Perhaps perhaps that desi that particular suggestion needs to go back to management
User Interface: Yeah, but it's kind of pointless, isn't it?
Project Manager: and perhaps go to another group to actually design as a separate product.
User Interface: Yeah.
Marketing: {vocalsound} That, you know, that might be {disfmarker}
User Interface: Let's delegate. {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Wo would that be agreeable?
Marketing: And then we could keep it titanium.
Industrial Designer: Yeah. {vocalsound} W w would it be helpful if um I described the components a bit, because I think it would give you um {disfmarker} maybe bring this discussion back to Earth of what we can actually physically do.
User Interface: {vocalsound} Yeah, maybe. Or {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Do you wanna be next or you want Kate to go next?
User Interface: I think possibly it might be more useful if Kate went next.
Project Manager: Okay, we'll move the {disfmarker}
User Interface: Um {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
User Interface: {vocalsound} You can even have them in different flavours as well. {vocalsound} So that if you just wanna sit there and chew on the remote, it could be like pear flavour,
Marketing: Yeah. Or s or smelly. Scratchy
User Interface: yeah. Scratch and sniff. {vocalsound}
Marketing: Uh well I was really thinking a lot about the I_ uh the iMac kind of gel gem tone.
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} Right, well
Marketing: It's hot on the streets, guys.
Industrial Designer: I I I think some of this um {disfmarker}
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: you're gonna be a little disappointed with some of the things I have to tell you, but I'm afraid this is the real world. {vocalsound} So um I've been looking at the the basics of how these devices actually have to work in order to operate, and I've had some discussions with the ma manufacturing division, who have told me what's actually available, you know, what the current state of the art in components is, and some of the exciting new things they've got, but I'm not sure that it's quite what you want um. Now this isn't a very good overhead, but this is just to show you, this is the innards of a remote control um. I really need a pen or something but uh {disfmarker} does my mouse work? No. Um {disfmarker} oh yeah, can you see my little mouse pointer?
Project Manager: Mm.
Industrial Designer: Right. This is this is the a a {vocalsound} a remote that's been opened up
Project Manager: Mm.
Industrial Designer: and that's the the back of the interface. And this is a push-button one, so you see these little little buttons here, they're little rubber rubber buttons that go through onto the the board at the back and they push these buttons here. Um {vocalsound} and we {disfmarker} that's the basic construction that we've got to got to accommodate. We got to have something that pushes the little buttons that um talk to the chip that encodes the message that sends the the message to the receiver. So um I wan I wanna go through not not just addressing the um {vocalsound} uh the the points that you made, Sarah, but um {vocalsound} doing my presentation in the order I wrote it. {vocalsound} So first of all um I wanna talk about what possibilities we've got for the energy source.
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: Um we can have your bog standard double double A_ batteries in a replaceable um little compartment. We can have a hand {disfmarker} {vocalsound} sorry {disfmarker}
User Interface: {vocalsound} A wind-up.
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: a wind-up, yeah, {vocalsound} which I think is quite an interesting concept for a {disfmarker} {vocalsound} sorry {disfmarker} for a remote control,
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: but i it maybe is {disfmarker} doesn't quite go with the um the fruit and veg.
Marketing: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound}
Project Manager: {vocalsound} Alright.
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Um one that one that I think is quite interesting is the kinetic energy source,
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Remember, we only have forty minutes
Industrial Designer: where um {vocalsound} you you actually get the energy by moving the device,
Marketing: Mm.
Project Manager: Hmm.
Industrial Designer: which is quite a ni a nice and neat one. You have to {disfmarker} it means that if it's sitting there for a long time it probably won't work, but you have to sort of throw it between your hands every now and then, it'll work.
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: Or we we had talked about solar power,
Marketing: Hmm.
Industrial Designer: but I thing that we agreed that that's not so good in the dark.
Project Manager: Mm.
Industrial Designer: Now I'm afraid this is the options we've got on on the case. It can be made of plastic, rubber, wood o if you like, {vocalsound} or titanium.
Marketing: {vocalsound} Hmm.
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: Um and the nearest we've got to st to spongy there I guess is rubber, but um {vocalsound} I'm gonna come back to the advantages of titanium,
Marketing: Hmm.
Industrial Designer: and basically it can have a flat surface, a curved surface or a double curved surface, but I think if we wanna use standard components, we're gonna have difficulty with anything much beyond that.
Marketing: Hmm.
Industrial Designer: Okay, what does the interface look like? Um well push button, that's that's the one we're all familiar with. {vocalsound} Um we can have scroll buttons and the the scroll button can incorporate a push,
Project Manager: Hmm.
Industrial Designer: so you can have it like on a mouse where you can use it to go up and down, change volume or channel or something like that and push to select something. {vocalsound} Um you can have multiple scroll buttons, um this is maybe getting a little bit complicated, but um it's it {disfmarker} the technology is there. And we can also incorporate an L_C_D_ display in the remote, but this will increase the cost. {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Um the electronics that actually makes the device work, we've basically got three, simple, regular, advanced, and the price goes up as we choose each of this. If we want the nice cheap one, the simple, then we can only have push buttons. All the other fancy interface designs go out the window, I'm afraid. Um pay a little bit more for a regular chip and you can have scroll buttons. If you want the advanced chip it obviously costs more, but it {disfmarker} that's what you need if you want the L_C_D_ display. And the manufacturing devision tell me that they have recently developed um sample sensor sample speaker devices. Now I don't know what that is, but I think they think it's quite important and we might want to incorporate it somewhere. Um ou our real expertise is in push buttons, I have to say, but maybe you think that's old technology. {vocalsound}
Marketing: Mm.
Industrial Designer: And {disfmarker} well I I think we've got two options. We can either go for a really cheap model, keep all of the costs down, um which {vocalsound} means a flat plastic case with an ordinary battery and simple push buttons. Or we can have something that looks a bit nicer, I think it, um won't necessarily l uh look like a pineapple, but um that {vocalsound} may or may not be a good thing.
Marketing: {vocalsound}
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} Sorry. {vocalsound} Um {vocalsound} but it could have an L_C_D_ screen and it could have multiple scroll buttons, and it could have the the company's new development of the um sample sensor and speaker. {vocalsound} So, thank you.
Marketing: That sounds good. Any idea {disfmarker} {vocalsound} you you mentioned that there would be a cost difference.
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} Yeah,
Marketing: Um do you have any idea if if this could {disfmarker} if the fancy model could be done in twelve Euros fifty?
Industrial Designer: I'm afraid I don't have that information available. Um manufacturing didn't actually give {disfmarker} attach any prices to any of this, I'm afraid.
Project Manager: Hmm.
Marketing: Hmm. Because, you know what, I'm being quite serious when I say that that um the things I mentioned are hot. But I think the important thing might be to choose one.
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} Yeah mm-hmm.
Marketing: You know, if if what you're telling me is is um some of these things aren't just f aren't feasible, maybe we could something about naming, we could call it, you know, Blackberry.
User Interface: Bear bear in mind it has to be the colours and styles of the company,
Marketing: That's uh {disfmarker}
User Interface: so what I had been thinking was something chunky and yellow and plastic with black buttons with a logo on it.
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} Banana?
Marketing: {vocalsound} Alright, well let's see then.
User Interface: But um I I don't know how important that is to keep it exactly the colours of the Real Reaction company.
Marketing: Yeah.
User Interface: It's just what I'd understood we'd be doing. That's before I heard about all this hot tips about the future, fruit-wise.
Marketing: Yeah. But {disfmarker} yeah,
Industrial Designer: We we could we could do um a double curved rubber one,
Marketing: I'm trying to streamline mine a little bit.
Industrial Designer: which would allow um say a banana, but um unfortunately I see from my notes that if we do that, we have to have a push button as the interface,
Marketing: Yeah.
Industrial Designer: we can't do anything fancier.
User Interface: Shall we wait'til I've'til I've showed you what {disfmarker} well, {vocalsound} my extensive presentation {vocalsound} on what sort of interfaces are available.
Marketing: Hmm.
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Marketing: Yeah.
Industrial Designer: Yep.
Marketing: Mm. Thank you, Kate.
Project Manager: Thank you, Kate.
Marketing: Mm.
User Interface: You did seem to include just in more detail what I've got though. So {vocalsound} so mine's a bit pointless. Right. {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
User Interface: F_N_ and F_ eight, did you say?
Project Manager: Yes. There we go.
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} {vocalsound}
User Interface: I don't have it on mine though.
Marketing: Oh I think um Florence resolved it by
Industrial Designer: I If you do F_ uh F_N_ F_ eight again, it's {disfmarker} it'll {disfmarker}
Project Manager: {vocalsound} Do it again.
Marketing: F_ eight again.
Project Manager: Keep doing it until you get it in both {disfmarker} you get it there, you get it yours without that one,
Industrial Designer: I think it {disfmarker} yeah, you you will do an {disfmarker}
Project Manager: and then you get it with both.
User Interface: Should I do it again?
Project Manager: Yeah.
Marketing: Maybe.
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: This time it should come up both.
User Interface: {vocalsound} Right then. I don't actually have a huge amount of different information then what Kate says,
Project Manager: Okay.
User Interface: just that my method was to look at the, well, my my inspirations, which was a big collection of lots of different models of remote controls and other things that use a similar sort of thing, including M_P_ three players, uh like you know, hi-fi remotes, not just television and these things.
Project Manager: Mm-hmm. Mm.
User Interface: Uh having a think about the feature of ea the features of each ones, um what functions we actually need, and then how to group and arrange these on the actual the actual plastic or rubber hand-held piece. {vocalsound} Uh I've been especially interested in the iPod style scroll wheel, which {disfmarker} Well, I couldn't find a {disfmarker} the picture of the iPod w only linked to a web browser, so I couldn't copy and paste it, but it had a similar thing to this thing on the right. It has uh scroll wheels without without a display, but they they scroll like a computer mouse.
Project Manager: Hmm.
Industrial Designer: Hmm.
User Interface: So I was thinking that uh {vocalsound} um a really simple a really simple interface with just a couple of scroll things on it um and then instead of a display the display could appear on the television screen. Like I guess an existing Sky or cable one does. Like, you know, you press enter and it comes up with what's showing on that channel at the moment, and you can do {disfmarker} you can scroll along and it'll show you what's on in the next half hour, and you scroll up
Marketing: {vocalsound}
User Interface: and you can see what's on the other channels while you're watching the same channel on the screen. Uh but I'm also equally taken with this chunky plastic kiddie remote,
Marketing: Mm.
User Interface: um which is really nice and fun and good to hold and nice, big, easy buttons to press, but still quite simple and quite cost effective. So
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
User Interface: what seems kind of ideal for me would be to just have a fairly simple, uh not fancy but not totally minimalist, I mean just pretty simple plastic, probably, I was thinking, yellow and black, just because that's the company's colours, with very very few buttons, but that would correspond to a screen that would appear on the television screen, like, you know, {vocalsound} just small along the bottom instead of instead of having the iPod style display screen on the actual remotes, which is far too expensive.
Project Manager: Mm.
Industrial Designer: Hmm.
User Interface: And when you've got a screen sitting there in front of you, you might as well have it appearing uh on the screen in front of you, it doesn't obscure much of the actual picture you're watching.
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
User Interface: And so on that you can, just much in the same way as an existing Sky remote, scroll along, scroll up and down.
Industrial Designer: Yeah, I'd I'd certainly support that idea.
User Interface: And uh and I definitely support uh the use of plastic and or rubber. I mean titanium would be great, but I think it might be a bit too expensive and too kinda spacey. If we're k trying to keep it colourful and slightly organic, then I think titanium's too futuristic.
Industrial Designer: It's difficult to make fancy shapes in it as well, we can't for example have a double curved case in titanium unfortunately.
User Interface: Yeah. Whereas a plastic's so cheap and easy and mouldable and everything else.
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Marketing: Hmm.
User Interface: Uh {vocalsound} then {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} And the the having the the the screen on the television screen I think is a good idea,'cause um {vocalsound} otherwise we're we're putting up the price not only for putting {disfmarker} building the L_C_D_ in, but for the electronics as well.
User Interface: And it's a little bit pointless as well I think.
Industrial Designer: There is that.
User Interface: Like when when when you've got when you've got the screen there, it doesn't have to be anything fancy,
Marketing: It's a duplication.
User Interface: just a little menu showing {disfmarker} yeah, a menu, you go into one menu and then it can have your different options, whether you wanna change the settings or the you know, your information about programme that's on at the moment.
Marketing: Mm-hmm.
User Interface: I don't think that's to taxing to uh s engineer. {vocalsound} Um. But as for actually arranging them {disfmarker} let me go back to the to the picture of the kiddie one. And I quite like it,'cause it's just smooth and hand-held and it's got these easily reachable buttons that quite nicely uh spaced out, so something a bit like that with buttons arranged in a kind of circle. Up, down, left, right.
Marketing: Mm-hmm.
Industrial Designer: Do you want scroll buttons in that as well?
User Interface: I I was thinking not actually scroll, like a like mouse scroll, but you know, a {disfmarker} {vocalsound} I can't quite d uh describe it. {gap} you see on the one on the right, down at the bottom, is the mouse. Yeah, see where the mouse is,
Industrial Designer: Mm-hmm.
User Interface: like this s style thing where you c have up, down, left and right. And enter in the middle,
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} Right.
User Interface: so you pick your menu and then {disfmarker} your different options and when when you click on each one, it {disfmarker} you can go into a new menu for that. I'm getting a bit uh specific here.
Marketing: {gap}
User Interface: Really we'd have to use something to show you,
Industrial Designer: Yeah. I think I think that's a g nice clean design,
User Interface: but {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: it's playing to our strengths which are in push button technology.
Marketing: {vocalsound} To uh m make it.
User Interface: If {disfmarker} I don't think I can get it up on the screen. Ah here we go. Right.
Marketing: Oh nice.
User Interface: Well,
Marketing: Um {disfmarker} Hmm.
User Interface: the iPod spinning wheel is uh really complicated.
Project Manager: Huh.
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
User Interface: It does scroll, but it is hugely complicated. What else have we got?
Marketing: Mm. Wow.
User Interface: Them, they're terrible. But they all have this this feature of this uh {disfmarker} It's not quite a scroll wheel, but it's a kind of selection in this circle,
Project Manager: It's a selection wheel.
User Interface: which I think is a really good idea.
Industrial Designer: But we can implement it with simple push buttons, which is much cheaper.
User Interface: Yeah, like up, down, left and right. Which is good. And then and then {disfmarker} Yeah, so I mean either a channel up and down, volume up and down, next appearing programmes up and down, {vocalsound} uh and then also {vocalsound} when you get into the different menus on the screen, it's got your things like settings and contrast up and down.
Project Manager: Okay.
User Interface: So all you really need is these four buttons with the enter in the middle.
Project Manager: Okay.
User Interface: And that's it.
Industrial Designer: In fact {disfmarker}
User Interface: {vocalsound} Look at look at this one.
Industrial Designer: Oh that's really nice. {vocalsound}
User Interface: {vocalsound} Almost impossible to misplace or l or lose.
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
Marketing: {vocalsound} Do you think with um {disfmarker}
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
User Interface: Might take up your whole living room.
Marketing: {vocalsound} It seems that that uh you guys are quite keen on the plastic, perhaps the {disfmarker} something reminiscent of the child's remote. Do you think we could put it in a in a fruit colour? And have it abstract. You know,
User Interface: Possibly.
Marketing: we could call {vocalsound} like a fruit name,
Industrial Designer: Hmm.
User Interface: Yeah.
Marketing: but it would be a little more abstract.
Industrial Designer: Mm. We we could actually do it in rubber instead of plastic if you'd rather {disfmarker} if you feel {disfmarker} if you like the spongy {disfmarker}
User Interface: That also is possible.
Marketing: Mm-hmm.
User Interface: Just {disfmarker}
Marketing: I'm just just throwing out ideas.
Project Manager: Or call it a or call it a banana and have it in yellow.
Industrial Designer: Hmm.
Marketing: Yeah. I'm thinking maybe we need to be a little bit more abstract if the design constraints are so {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Okay.
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} Yeah.
User Interface: Uh just something else I need to bring to your attention is have you have you seen these on a remote? This is actually the volume up and down,
Project Manager: Mm-hmm.
User Interface: but {vocalsound} they both say V_ on them,
Project Manager: Mm-hmm.
User Interface: which, when you first look at it, {vocalsound} you expect that to be the down, because it looks like a downward pointing arrow,
Marketing: Mm-hmm.
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
Project Manager: Hmm.
User Interface: but it's actually the V_ to indicate that it's the volume, so uh we do need to avoid little ambiguities like these.
Marketing: Mm-hmm.
Project Manager: Hmm.
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
Marketing: Nice. Good point.
User Interface: But we wouldn't have a specific volume up and down. If we're having the scroll wheel, then it's gonna double up as all the other up and down functions.
Project Manager: Mm'kay.
User Interface: But then, that's complicated.
Project Manager: I wanna thank you all for all your presentations. We have about ten minutes left, in which time we have to make some decisions on the remote control concepts. Um and I think you all have been self-stimulating of working together. Um we need to come up with some specifics of the components, um the materials, things like making the decision on the energy um and the case and the interface type things. So {vocalsound} let's {disfmarker} Mm. Right. They want us to decide what form of energy are we going to use, which {disfmarker} the choices that we've discussed were pretty much battery, kinetic or solar. Um this is where Kate's expertise comes in, and our decision making will be a little bit guided by Kate at this point.
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: The {disfmarker} You were saying that the kinetic would be useful, that is you just have to move it some and you'd be able to use it um as opposed to a battery that you have to either put it in a recharger or um keep replacing the batteries. Um or solar that you'd have difficulty with it if it's a dark day, that it'll die on you, and no way to do it. That's the day you wanna use the T_V_.
Industrial Designer: Mm.
Project Manager: Um so what's our pleasure here, what would be the cost consequences of each of the three?
Industrial Designer: Oh unfortunately I don't have costing information.
Project Manager: Okay.
Industrial Designer: I i in terms of workability, I I think the the two front-runners are the standard battery or the kinetic,
Project Manager: Mm'kay.
Industrial Designer: but I'm sorry I don't figures on the difference in cost.
Project Manager: What's the uh feelings of the group on the kinetic?
Marketing: I've used kinetic in terms of watches and it's very very uh handy, you don't even notice um that it's there.
User Interface: It sounds great. I've never come across it before, but it sounds fantastic. Sounds like it could be g a really good economical {disfmarker}
Marketing: It's {disfmarker}
User Interface: it would make the whole thing a lot lighter, more convenient.
Marketing: Mm-hmm.
Project Manager: Hmm.
Marketing: It could tie in with the fanciful design
Project Manager: Hmm.
User Interface: Yeah.
Marketing: as uh, you know, {vocalsound}
User Interface:'Cause it's really a quite attractive thought,
Marketing: throw the banana, you know, just gotta keep it moving.
User Interface: isn't it? It's like {disfmarker} yeah,
Project Manager: So the consensus seems to be use the kinetic if it's at all possible.
User Interface: a good selling point.
Marketing: Be
User Interface: But it does depend how much I mean how much it costs and how much more development and research it needs.
Project Manager: It costs. {vocalsound} Mm.
Industrial Designer: And and how much you do have to keep it moving,
Marketing: Yeah.
Project Manager: Mm.
Industrial Designer:'cause I'm conscious that watching T_V_ can be quite a sed sedentary activity.
Marketing: Yeah. Mm-hmm.
Project Manager: Mm.
Marketing: But I could market that as a um as a {vocalsound} a {disfmarker} I was thinking actually a a cost saver down the road, in terms of battery, you know.
User Interface: {vocalsound} Do your exercises while you're watching the T_V_. {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} Yeah. {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Hmm.
Industrial Designer: True, yeah, m more more environmentally friendly.
User Interface: Yeah, that's what I was thinking as well.
Marketing: Mm-hmm. You know,
Project Manager: Yeah.
Marketing: kind of the {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Thanks for the reminder for five minutes to finish, thanks.
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} Oh right, okay,
Project Manager: Um {vocalsound} the next thing that they wanted us to do was look at chip on print as a decision.
Industrial Designer: I'd {disfmarker} that that's something I maybe should have covered. Um chip on print is just a manufacturing technique
Project Manager: Oh.
Industrial Designer: um and I would certainly recommend it, I think, because I'm not sure I have an alternative.
Project Manager: Okay.
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: What about the ca
Industrial Designer: I i it it's just the way that the the the uh th the way it's ac it's actually built
Project Manager: yeah. Oh, the way we {gap} uh-huh.
Industrial Designer: and you you print onto the circuit board like you might print onto paper.
Project Manager: Oh, okay. Um what about the case? I think they're talking there about do we want wood, plastic, titanium or rubber,
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: and I think we've discussed not having titanium. One, it's too expensive, um and second, it won't do this double um curves. Um we've sort of eliminated wood. We said plastic or rubber. What's the pleasure?
Industrial Designer: Well if if Sarah's keen on a spongy feel, the the rubber that we're talking about is the same as you have in those little stress balls, so it's {disfmarker}
Marketing: That's exactly what I was thinking. I'm sold.
Industrial Designer: yeah.
Project Manager: What about you?
User Interface: Do you not think it might need like a kind of a hard plastic inner shell with the actual delicate workings inside, and then a kind of spongy Yeah, s thick spongy cover,
Marketing: Mm. Kind of like an internal egg.
Project Manager: Cover.
User Interface: so it feels like the whole thing's spongy, but actually you're not damaging anything by squeezing it. {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Plastic inside.
Marketing: Yeah. {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
User Interface: Because I mean you could just get carried away with the with the tac
Industrial Designer: I'd I'd need to talk to manufacturing again about whether that's actually possible, but I agree, it's uh {disfmarker} sounds like a nice idea if it is.
User Interface: Yeah. Well you do get a bit carried away with things that are tactile, you just wanna stroke them and squeeze them,
Project Manager: Hmm.
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Marketing: And with sports on television.
Project Manager: Okay.
User Interface: and {disfmarker}
Marketing: You know. {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Um the next part they want is the user interface concept.
Industrial Designer: I should I should r {gap}
Marketing: I su
Project Manager: I'm sorry to push you, but we only have a couple minutes to {vocalsound} finish with.
Marketing: Then I'll just say I support either {disfmarker} from a marketing point of view I support either decision that the designers make on that.
Project Manager: Okay, and it says interface. What type and what supplements?
User Interface: Just copy the one on the left. {vocalsound} No um a scroll {disfmarker} Well, like four buttons, up, down, left and right with enter in the middle, that will correspond to a menu on the screen.
Industrial Designer: Which I think technically is just push button and uh I'd certainly support that that
User Interface: Yeah,
Industrial Designer: that brings the cost down quite a lot
User Interface: I'd {disfmarker} like push buttons with {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: and it's something that we're an ex the company's an expert on.
User Interface: So push buttons {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Okay, um {vocalsound} that's that. Um this is gonna sound weird, but the next meeting starts in thirty minutes. Whew.
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: And they actually want a look and feel design, user interface design, you can look and see this as well as I can. Marketing they want product evaluation.
User Interface: No, it's still it's still plugged in on mine actually.
Marketing: No we can't, actually.
Project Manager: Oh. Oh my, I'm sorry.
Marketing: That's why I was looking over your shoulder
Project Manager: Oh, okay. Sorry about that. missed that one. This ought to be fun trying to get this thing to work. Ah, ta-da.
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
User Interface: Now it's gone again.
Project Manager: Ah.
Industrial Designer: You know, I think the the company's s next project should to design a better overhead device that switches immediately. {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Yes, because I can't even see mine. Next meeting starts in thirty minutes,
User Interface: Oh yes.
Project Manager: these are {vocalsound} the individual actions. Yeah, right. Um the look and feel design is for Kate,
Marketing: Mm.
Project Manager: uh Steph gets the user interface design, you get product {vocalsound} evaluation. Um the two of you {vocalsound} get to play with a Pla modelling clay um to do a prototype.
User Interface: Great.
Project Manager: Uh and everybody gets individual instructions in the usual way.
Marketing: Sounds good.
Project Manager: {vocalsound} Anything else we need to do?
User Interface: {vocalsound} I don't think so.
Project Manager: Go to it. {vocalsound}
User Interface: Play-Doh.
Project Manager: And that's the end of this meeting. That's for her benefit. {vocalsound}
Marketing: {vocalsound} That's really all I got, guys.
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}","This meeting was a conceptual design meeting. In this meeting, the group mainly discussed the component, energy source, buttons, colours and styles of the remote control. They decided to use the kinetic as the energy source because of its convenience, light weight, fancy design and the good selling point of the environment, but they still needed more cost research. They also reached a final consensus to apply a hard plastic inner shell with a spongy plastic for the component, and push buttons for the type of interface due to their common features of convenience and user-friendliness.",qmsum
"What did the group discuss about Industrial Designer's presentation on energy source and case material design of the remote control?
Marketing: Oh right okay. {vocalsound} I cover myself up. {vocalsound}
Project Manager: I feel like Madonna with one of these on. I said I feel like Madonna with one of these on. {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Marketing: {gap}.
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
Marketing: {vocalsound} I've always wanted one of these, I really have. {vocalsound} Where do you buy'em from? {vocalsound} They're {gap}.
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Right. Hello everybody.
User Interface: Hello.
Project Manager: Back again for another wonderful meeting.
Industrial Designer: {gap}.
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Is uh everyone ready?
User Interface: Yeah.
Industrial Designer: Almost. {vocalsound}
Marketing: Yeah.
Project Manager: Okay, we c we can hold on for a minute.
Marketing: {vocalsound} Oh my gosh. {vocalsound} {gap} {vocalsound}
Project Manager: I figured with the spam thing, if you can't beat it, join in. {vocalsound}
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Marketing: {vocalsound}
User Interface: That's the kind of spam that everybody likes to receive.
Marketing: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: Mm'kay.
Project Manager: Are you ready? Okay, right, well, I take it that you are all ready now.
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Um alright first off we'll just uh recap from our last meeting. Um {vocalsound} which was we got together just to basically decide on {disfmarker} well to talk about what it is that we were actually uh supposed to be doing,
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: and who we all are and stuff like that, mm get bit more of an idea together of what's going on. {vocalsound} Um what we are gonna talk about in this meeting is um now that we know what it is that we are doing, now we know that it's a T_V_ remote and stuff and you guys have just been off doing some some uh R_ and D_ for that, that's research and development for those that haven't heard that before,
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Marketing: Mm-hmm.
Project Manager: see I'm learning all sorts of new technologi terms in technology today. Um yeah, we're gonna hear your uh th three little presentations,
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: whether they be on computer or on the whiteboard or whatever you want.
User Interface: Hmm. {vocalsound} Do you have any preference uh of order?
Project Manager: Um I'd like to um hear
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: o I'd like to hear who's g who's on the um from from uh Catherine actually first. I want {disfmarker} what I'd like to hear about is uh if we've finally decided on um what sort of energy we're gonna be using and
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Marketing: Batteries.
User Interface: I think she is still finishing her {gap}. {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: No no no no, it's fine I'm just preparing.
Project Manager: It's just that {disfmarker} yeah, let's let's hear from you first.
Industrial Designer: Okay.
User Interface: Hmm.
Industrial Designer: Where is that thing?
User Interface: Okay, it's uh {vocalsound} {disfmarker}
Marketing: It's here.
Industrial Designer: Oh sorry, couldn't see.
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: Would that work?
Project Manager: Get yourself in position. {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} Okay, so that's me again.
Marketing: Ah.
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} Um so um for the energy sources we can have a basic battery, a hand dynamo which is {disfmarker} which was used uh in the fifties for torches, if you remember that kind of {disfmarker} which wouldn't be v wouldn't be v v
Project Manager: I don't think any of us remember the fifties.
User Interface: Is it like a crank thing or something {gap}.
Industrial Designer: yeah, yeah. It wouldn't be very fancy.
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: You can have a kinetic provision of energy, which is used on some watches these days. So if you have just a bit of gentle movement that {disfmarker} it will give it the energy to work.
Marketing: Mm.
Industrial Designer: Or you can use solar cells, but I'm not sure about that indoors, really, but {disfmarker}
User Interface: Well, there's sometimes combinations, I mean, like calculators do combinations of battery with {disfmarker} but also using some solar power.
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
Project Manager: Do {gap} sol solar panel things, do they have to work from the sun or can they work from a light bulb?
Marketing: Mm.
Project Manager: Does anybody know?
Industrial Designer: I dunno actually.
User Interface: Uh I think, it has to be on the on the solar energy, but I don't know.
Industrial Designer: I dunno. Um. Think the the uh what would cost the less would be the basic battery, really.
Project Manager: Okay.
Industrial Designer: And uh if we want something fancier, I think the kinetic provision of energy could be nice,
Marketing: Mm.
Industrial Designer: but I don't know if it's worth the cost. So we've got to discuss that.
Project Manager: Mm. Okay, jolly good.
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} For the case of the remotes itself, um they can be a general case, which is just a flat one. You can have uh a curved one or a double curved one, if you know what I mean, so {disfmarker}
Project Manager: What's a double curved one?
Industrial Designer: You know, kind of more ergonomic, that kind of suits the palm of your hand, that kind of thing.
Project Manager: Okay.
Industrial Designer: So {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Um then the case material itself, so it can be uh uh either plastic or latex, uh rubber, wood, or titanium. And th for each of them you have uh cases where {disfmarker} for example titanium, you can't use it for {disfmarker} if you if we're choosing a double curved case, we can't choose titanium. And if we are choosing um solar cells then we can't choose latex for the case material, so we just have to take that into account. But if we're choosing just the flat case then we can go for anything. And I think we discussed earlier on the R_ S_ I_ problem thing, so we could uh {disfmarker}
Project Manager: So that might be an idea of using the rubber,
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
Project Manager: but then it should, you know {disfmarker}
User Interface: Let's have a squeezable remote. {vocalsound}
Project Manager: yeah.
Industrial Designer: Yeah. And also it doesn't break as easily maybe,
Project Manager: {gap} when a T_V_ programme's got one {gap}
Industrial Designer: I dunno {disfmarker}
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: watching the match and {gap} your team's just lost, you can fuzz it across the room and it'll bounce off the wall back at you.
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Marketing: Yeah.
Project Manager: Yeah, I like that idea.
Marketing: Mm.
Industrial Designer: So rubber would be {disfmarker} Okay.
Marketing: I think rubber's {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Rubber, we're all we're all going {disfmarker} we're all liking that idea? You think you can market that?
Marketing: But after my after my fashion thing, I think you'll realise that rubber is more {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Ooh, we like rubber, ooh. {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: Uh s so if d
Marketing: People. {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: okay. And then there are the push-buttons, so you can have basic push-buttons or a scroll-wheels, like you have on a mouse, um or you could have um L_C_D_, which gives you a display. Um scroll buttons, as well.
Project Manager: Uh-huh.
Industrial Designer: So if you use a rubber double curved case, you must use rubber push-buttons. So if we're going for rubber then we have to decide for the case. Um and if we choose double curved then we have to go for rubber push-buttons.
Project Manager: Well, we're gonna go with {gap} I think we've decided that it's gonna be a rubber case so {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: So it's a constraint. Yeah, but is it a double curved one or not? {vocalsound} If it's not a double curved, then we've got the choice for the push-buttons, if it's a double curve, we've gotta go for rubber push-buttons. If that makes sense.
Project Manager: {gap} push buttons instead of the wheel?
Industrial Designer: Yeah. {gap}.
User Interface: If it's rubber, isn't it malleable anyway, {gap} it doesn't matter if it's double {disfmarker} I mean isn't a rubber case, mean it's completely flexed, I mean, it it flexes to whatever they want it to? Mean so what's the difference between a normal rubber case and a rubble doub double {disfmarker} rubber double curved case? {vocalsound}
Project Manager: {gap} rubble double double. {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: No, but na le you see, you've got, okay, the energy that's one thing,
Project Manager: I'll have a Big Mac, please. {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: then you have the case is uh, whether it's flat or curved. And that's {disfmarker} {vocalsound} we don't care if it's rub rubber or not, but then we've decided that we going for rubber for the case material. So if we've chosen rub rubber and if now we have the choice for the case whether it's flat, single curved or double curved. And I'm just saying if it {disfmarker} if we choose it to be double curved then we need to go {disfmarker} I dunno why, but we need to go for uh rubber push-buttons. So, either {disfmarker}
User Interface: Okay.
Industrial Designer: I dunno we just need to decide on the on the case.
Project Manager: Let's have rubber push buttons, hey.
User Interface: Okay. Go rubber. Go rubber the whole way.
Industrial Designer: Let's go crazy. {vocalsound} And then, do I have a last slide? Yes, I do. Um so the push-buttons themselves they can be just simple or they can be {disfmarker} so that's just the electronics between the but behind the push-buttons.
Project Manager: Yeah.
Industrial Designer: Um and the price that go with it with it, so the simple push-buttons are gonna be the cheapest. Uh if we get a scroll-wheel, that's a higher price range. If we get an advanced chip which is um used for the L_C_D_, the display thing, then that's even more expensive.
Project Manager: {vocalsound} Simple, yeah. Chip on print. It's a bit {gap}. {vocalsound} Okay, uh what I'm not understanding here
Industrial Designer: Mm.
Project Manager: {vocalsound} is uh, okay, advanced chip on print, which I presume is like one P_C_B_ and that's got all the electronics on one board including the um infra-red sender?
Industrial Designer: {gap}. Yeah.
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: The infra-red. Yeah.
Project Manager: Right. Um what a what alternatives do we have to that? {vocalsound} Y um {vocalsound} what alternatives do we have to the chip on print?
Industrial Designer: Well, if if it's not chip on print then, I guess, you get different chip components, and you build them separately and doesn't include the infra-red. It's less expensive mm {disfmarker}
Project Manager: {vocalsound} so it sounds {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Technically speaking, it's not as advanced, but it does the job, too. {vocalsound}
Project Manager: So, why would we not go for that? If it's something that's inside the the unit. {vocalsound} I it doesn't affects whether the customer's gonna buy it or not.
Industrial Designer: Fo It doesn't, yeah, yeah, yeah. Totally. Yeah.
Project Manager: Um we wanna go for an i i all {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: So let's not go for the {disfmarker}
Project Manager: so long as it works,
Industrial Designer: Yeah, yeah. I agree.
Project Manager: you know. So let's not let's uh not bother with the chip on print.
Industrial Designer: So it's either um the scroll-wheel or the push-buttons.
Project Manager: Yeah. S yeah, push buttons.
Marketing: What about the just developed uh sample sensor?
User Interface: I think push-buttons is {disfmarker}
Project Manager: What about what?
Marketing: G there, the sample sensor, sample speaker thing.
Industrial Designer: Well {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Well, what do we need a speaker for in a remote control unit?
Marketing: Mm, I dunno. Be cool.
Industrial Designer: It'd be it'd be cool, but they are saying they've just developed it,
User Interface: Yeah.
Marketing: {vocalsound} Channel two. {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: I'm just guessing. But it's gonna be the most expensive option, probably and {disfmarker}
Project Manager: S
User Interface: Th the the {vocalsound} speech recognition um option is {disfmarker} it doesn't seem really very promising for us uh,
Project Manager: Yeah. It's not something that we wanna t go into with this product.
User Interface:'cause uh {disfmarker} The yeah the example that they're already using it for is with the coffee machine, where, basically, you can program a sample wi um {disfmarker} That when you say something it will give a response, and you program the response as well. Just uh clips of tha that you record yourself. So you can program your coffee-maker that when you say, good morning, to it it says, hello Rick, or whatever.
Project Manager: Yeah. {vocalsound}
User Interface: But, I mean, it's not {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Hm.
User Interface: it would be one thing if it was speech recognition where you say something and it turns the T_V_ on like, turn the T_V_ on, and i turns {disfmarker} comes on, but it's not that. It just gives you a it just gives you a verbal response.
Marketing: Oh, it just gives an answer.
User Interface: So, yeah, I mean, like what's the point of saying, Hello remote, I mean, hello, how how are you? {vocalsound}
Marketing: Oh, then then {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Yeah. Yeah. {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} Just if you are really lonely, maybe. {vocalsound}
Marketing: I thought I thought it was {disfmarker} when they said {disfmarker}
User Interface: Yeah, if you're really lonely, it is it's {disfmarker}
Marketing: I thought when they said, voice recognition, they meant um like,
Industrial Designer: Channel five. And then it switches on.
Marketing: channel five, and it will change.
User Interface: No, tha that w that w that would be more promising.
Marketing: Like you talk to it. Can I have channel five?
Project Manager: Yeah.
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
User Interface: It it's just a remote that talks to you.
Project Manager: Yeah. Yeah.
User Interface: Uh. {vocalsound} I mean to certain cues.
Marketing: Oh, then {gap} forget about it. Oh right okay.
Project Manager: Yeah.
Industrial Designer: Okay, so I'll go back, maybe, to the previous slide and we can decide for each problem, what we should choose. So for the energy source, do we go for the battery or the {disfmarker}
User Interface:'Kay. Yeah, I'm fine with the basic battery.
Project Manager: Basic battery.
Marketing: Mm.
Project Manager: It's cheap, it's cheerful, it's worked, does work.
User Interface: Hmm.
Industrial Designer: Cheaper option. Are you happy with that?
Marketing: Mm. Yeah.
Industrial Designer: Okay. So we'll go for the battery. Then the case, do you want it flat or curved or sing or double curved?
Project Manager: We were go we were going with the late with the the R_S_I_ rubber, weren't we?
User Interface: Yeah, so we want it rub rubber double curved. {vocalsound}
Project Manager: The the {gap} {vocalsound} {disfmarker}
Marketing: So it will look like something like this.
Industrial Designer: Double?
Project Manager: The double whopper, please.
Industrial Designer: Okay, so then if we use double curved case, then we have to u choose rubber push-buttons,
Project Manager: Yep, but {disfmarker} we're going for the simple buttons.
User Interface: So rubber rubber keys, yeah.
Project Manager: Yeah.
Industrial Designer: and that's fine?
Project Manager: And it's cheapest all round, it sounds kinda funky, and we can also market it
Industrial Designer: P
User Interface: Yeah.
Project Manager: as i'cause we were s saying earl you were saying earlier in your research that um the the people have the R_ {disfmarker} people were getting the {disfmarker} complaining about R_S_I_, and this is anti-R_S_I_.
Marketing: {gap}.
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
Marketing: Yeah.
Project Manager: So that's another marketing point that we can use.
Marketing: Well the rubber push-buttons {gap}. Don't you have to move your {disfmarker}
Project Manager: But anything is gonna have buttons.
Marketing: Mm.
Project Manager: Even if it's a jog wheel, it's still repetitive. You {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: I thought they would give an option of flat buttons or a {disfmarker}
Project Manager: You see, you can still get {disfmarker} it does you still get repetitive strain injury, whether you are pressing a button or pressing a flat bit of screen.
Industrial Designer: That they don't. {vocalsound}
Project Manager: It's the v it's the fact that you are pressing the same {disfmarker} doing the same movement.
Industrial Designer: Mm.
User Interface: {gap}.
Project Manager: It's not actually what you are doing.
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: But the fact that this this rubber i is actually used in these anti-R_S_I_ ps specific {disfmarker}
Marketing: Mm.
User Interface: Yeah.
Marketing: Yeah, the rubber's good.
User Interface: We're giving them a way to burn off steam, basically, yeah.
Project Manager: Yeah.
Marketing: Yeah, so they can sit there and go like {disfmarker}
User Interface: {vocalsound} Not that watching T_V_ should be that stressful.
Project Manager: And you know, yeah, you can fuzz it across the room and throw it at throw it at your children {disfmarker} yeah.
Marketing: {vocalsound}
User Interface: {vocalsound} Oh yeah, I guess T_V_ can be stressful, yeah, if you're watching sports.
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: Alright, that's me done.
Project Manager: Okay, Gabriel. Let's um let's let's hear from you about the um it's {disfmarker} the interface.
User Interface: Alright. Alright. Yeah, some of what I have to say ties into what Catherine was just talking about.
Project Manager: Great.
Industrial Designer: Sorry.
User Interface: Okay, so I'm continuing with the user interface uh topic. And so basically I consulted with our manufacturing division. It sounded like Catherine was also speaking with them. Uh I also took uh Reissa's marketing findings from the last meeting into consideration um,'cause I think that's that's crucial as far as uh what keys we're going to inc inclu what buttons we are going to include and and how they're laid out.
Project Manager: Mm.
User Interface: Uh and so the manufacturing division uh sent some some samples of of uh interface components that we might be interested in using that have been used in other products, uh like the coffee machine. So I already mentioned the speech recognition interface.
Marketing: {vocalsound}
User Interface: I guess, we we basically vetoed that idea. It's it's pointless.
Project Manager: Mm.
User Interface: Uh it's just a sample sensor sample output. It would just be probably the most expensive part of our remote without any actual interesting functionality as far as operating the T_V_. Uh so yeah, they they also give the uh {disfmarker} they they suggested the idea of using a spinning wheel like you use on the side of an M_P_ three player like iPod.
Project Manager: Mm.
Marketing: Mm.
User Interface: Um so we've already addressed that and I think that would actually be worse for something like R_S_I_ I mean you got that thumb movement that you're constantly doing.
Project Manager: Yeah.
Marketing: Mm.
User Interface: Um the other suggestion,
Marketing: That does get annoying.
User Interface: and I I have a feeling that we're interested in in something more general, but they suggested uh, you know, going i a little bit into a a niche, like either gearing our remote towards kids, where you could have {gap} lot of colours um, the keys might be you know, funny or or {gap},
Project Manager: Mm-hmm.
User Interface: or uh something for the elderly, where the remote's very large and the buttons are very large and there's only a few buttons. But you know we can we can discuss this, but it sounded like from our last meeting we really wanted something that was general, but done well.
Project Manager: Yeah.
User Interface: Uh {gap} um {disfmarker} So, the key layout and design are really crucial. You don't want uh you want people to be able to quickly access the buttons that they use a lot without uh always pressing the wrong one um. And I didn't mention that we need a power button {gap} in our last {disfmarker} I can give you an example here of uh, {gap} good layout and bad layout
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
User Interface: uh from our manufacturing department. So this would be an example of bad layout, where you have volume up and volume down, but they have a V_ on both of them, so uh
Project Manager: Yeah. Yeah.
User Interface: it's sort of confusing for the user. Uh this is the example of the giant remote that's impossible to lose.
Project Manager: Do we have an uh example of a good one? {gap} {vocalsound} Brilliant.
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Marketing: Uh-huh. Well {disfmarker}
User Interface: {vocalsound} And for {disfmarker} something for kids. Yeah. Um.
Project Manager: Yeah.
User Interface: And so, yeah, I th I think my personal preferences of {disfmarker} we've all kind of talked about and seemed to be on the same page um. Uh so I was against the speech recognition and against going uh towards anything in in a niche sense. I think it should be more general.
Project Manager: Mm-hmm.
User Interface: I didn't I didn't think the spinning-wheel or the uh L_C_ display were were crucial for us. And, yeah, that's it for me.
Project Manager: Okay. Well let's um {disfmarker} so w what are our definite decisions on this then as a team? The um {disfmarker} The the um the interface type we're going for {disfmarker}
User Interface: So we're {disfmarker} we're not gonna have any sort of display I think uh.
Project Manager: Just the simple s simple straight set of buttons.
User Interface: So, yeah, it's just gonna be just gonna be push-buttons. Um. I think we shall have a limited number of buttons,
Project Manager: Yeah.
User Interface: ideally, I mean a a power, channel up, channel down, volume up, volume down, and a numerical keypad.
Project Manager: Yeah.
User Interface: Uh. And some sort of {disfmarker} it will either have a a lock button like we mentioned or or a cover or something like that.
Project Manager: Yeah.
User Interface: I guess it's to the point where we need to decide about that.
Project Manager: Okay, and we're not {disfmarker} yeah.
User Interface: Well now that we've decided on our {disfmarker}
Project Manager: {gap} Are we gonna hav hav {disfmarker} an {disfmarker} are we d
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: have we decided on whether w we're gonna s supplement it with anything, you know, colours or particular gimmicky bits to it, we're not we're just gonna go for something {disfmarker}
User Interface: Um it seems like we wouldn't wanna make it too busy and too sort of gaudy,
Project Manager: We're {disfmarker}
Marketing: Maybe we can {disfmarker}
User Interface: but um {disfmarker} Yeah, I would say mayb maybe a couple of colours like uh like a black with with yellow and somewhere, like maybe the R_R_ can be yellow, or something like that.
Project Manager: Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Okey-dokey. Yeah, I don't have any other questions on this. Let's move over to {disfmarker}
User Interface: I I guess {vocalsound} the fact uh also that we are having a rubber case uh would prevent us from having the cover function that we thought of before.
Project Manager: Yeah, sure.
User Interface: I mean,'cause uh s so if we wanna have a lock of some sort it would have to be a button.
Project Manager: {gap}.
User Interface: But I think that should be {disfmarker} I mean um, I can speak with the button department, but uh I think that it should be easy to have a button that just prevents prevents the other uh the other buttons from operating.
Project Manager: Yeah, the button that just does that, yeah.
User Interface: So that should be simple.
Project Manager: Cool.
Marketing: Right. Well, I'm just basically letting you know what's happening in the markets
Project Manager: Mm yeah.
Marketing: and what the fashions are for next year. Um. So yes {vocalsound}, so from looking at this year's trends and fashions
Project Manager: Mm-hmm.
Marketing: and also recent investigation that we've done in the remote control market, we have found that for the remote control market {vocalsound} these are like most important aspects like that we really need to {disfmarker}
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
Marketing: which we've already probably discussed. Um {vocalsound} the most important aspect is look and feel. So the remote control has to look and feel fancier than the ones that already {disfmarker} that we already have. So it has to be {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Yeah, why should people buy this when they're already got a remote that came with the T_V_?
Marketing: Yep.
User Interface: Mm.
Marketing: Exactly.
User Interface: Yeah.
Marketing: {vocalsound} Um second, uh it should be technologically innovative innovative. So {disfmarker}
Project Manager: What's that mean?
Marketing: {vocalsound} Technologically it should be like um work, basically, I guess. It should work.
User Interface: Well it should be it should be maybe cutting edge in some sense,
Marketing: Should {disfmarker}
User Interface: I mean have something that's little more technologically advanced than what's on the market.
Marketing: That's new.
Project Manager: Okay, now the trouble is is we've already decided that we're going with the stuff that works already, that's cheap.
Marketing: Yeah.
User Interface: Yeah. Yeah. Actually, I mean, these first two points we've already sort of gone away from,
Marketing: Yeah.
User Interface:'cause our rubber one is not fancy {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Yeah.
Marketing: Mm.
User Interface: I mean it's different, but I wouldn't say like a rubber remote is fancy. If that's what people want then we {disfmarker} maybe we're going in the wrong direction. And it's it's not technologically innovative either.
Project Manager: Maybe we could um {disfmarker}
Marketing: So, {gap} no loose {disfmarker}
User Interface: Mm.
Marketing: That's why I was thinking, Bluetooth,'cause if you like put up Bluetooth, and it's like a Bluetooth remote control, everybody's gonna like, oh,'cause Bluetooth is the in thing nowadays, like it really is {vocalsound}, like people {disfmarker} and um when it comes to marketing like that's what people go for, they don't really care whether, you know, at the end of the day whether it works properly or not.
Project Manager: Of course, they do.
Marketing: Well, they do, but it's like it's not {disfmarker}
Project Manager: {vocalsound} One hundred per cent, that's your first thing, you go, oh I'm not gonna buy that,'cause I dunno if it works or not.
Marketing: Yeah, but it looks good. If it looks good and it's {disfmarker} it can just be there for decoration. {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Okay, well, what do you two think about this?
User Interface: So is is the advantage of Bluetooth that you can just like synchronise it with other
Marketing: But like {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Yeah, what {disfmarker} I don't understand what m
User Interface: electronics?
Marketing: You could always insert, yeah.
User Interface: Yeah, that's basically what it allows you to do,
Project Manager: Yeah,
User Interface: right?
Project Manager: and it {disfmarker} this is just gonna {gap} {disfmarker} all this is being used for is your television.
Marketing: Yeah, but, I mean, people like {disfmarker}
Project Manager: It would {disfmarker} that would mean you'd need a television that has Bluetooth in it, which no no television does,
Marketing: Well, if you're looking at {vocalsound} {disfmarker} if you {gap} looking at something that's going to be bought by people, you have to make it new, you have to make it state of the art.
Industrial Designer: Well {disfmarker}
Project Manager: does it? That would mean we'd have to make a television as well.
Industrial Designer: Bluetooth would, for example, enable you, I think, to um um connect {disfmarker} for example you if you get a w call on your mobile phone, but your mobile phone is downstairs or something, you would get on your television you're being called by this person right now. Things like that.
Project Manager: No, that would be your telephone {gap} in with your television.
Industrial Designer: No i
User Interface: Yeah, the {disfmarker} that wouldn't be the remote so much,
Project Manager: {vocalsound} Yeah,
User Interface: I mean {disfmarker}
Project Manager: and i
Industrial Designer: No, but if you get Bluetooth on the remote, you'd be able to {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Nah, the televi the television would have to be a Bluetooth compatible, basically.
Industrial Designer: I with the television, yeah. {gap} I was just trying to find an advantage. Wha what w what advantage would you get for the {disfmarker}
User Interface: Mm.
Marketing: Well, it doesn't {disfmarker}
Project Manager: An and there is no there is no such thing
Marketing: Like it doesn't have to be, you know, Bluetooth, that was just an idea, but like it needs do something that, you know, is new. Whether it's a battery {disfmarker} it could be something really really minor, you know, like {disfmarker} but I think we are really keeping to what is already out there, and people've already seen it, people've already got it.
Project Manager: Okay.
Marketing: If we want something new, we need to move away from what we already have and um just go creative.
Industrial Designer: Maybe the kinetic mo provision of energy then. It's been done for watches, but I haven't seen that for remotes, yet.
Project Manager: Okay. {vocalsound} Yeah, this {disfmarker} that's that's very good.
Marketing: And then you can market it. Never have to change a battery again. {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: Change the batteries ever again.
Project Manager: And and this is all tying in very nicely.
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: The fact that it's made out of this rubber, we can throw it about. Th we should encourage people to throw their remote controls about, because it charges itself up by doing it.
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} Yeah, well, and in little characters you say, yeah, but not too much. {vocalsound}
User Interface: Yes, so can {disfmarker}
Project Manager: But yeah, by the squeezing it the {disfmarker}
Marketing: I think, safety s
User Interface: Yeah, we can make the squeezing of the rubber be the be the generating {disfmarker} like the energy generator.
Project Manager: Yeah, that's a great idea. Well done.
Marketing: Yeah. Third most important aspect {vocalsound} uh is it's easy to use.
User Interface: {vocalsound} {gap} we're all about that.
Marketing: And I think we've all um worked that out. Um okay, in the fashion, how it's supposed to look. Next year's fashion i very much in fruit and vegetables are thm are like the theme for cloths, shoes and furniture. {vocalsound} So next year people will be buying {vocalsound}, I found this really funny {vocalsound}, you know, strawberry shaped chairs,
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
User Interface: Okay, so we could have keys that are like a b like a broccoli key and a uh and an avocado key on them.
Project Manager: Yeah.
Marketing: Yeah.
Project Manager: I wanna watch the pineapple channel. {vocalsound}
Marketing: Rubber things. {vocalsound} Um {vocalsound} and as it's rubber the feel which is in this year is spongy, so it's it's not quite spongy, but spongy, I would say is {disfmarker}
User Interface: {gap}.
Project Manager: Well spongy, that's where {gap}. Yeah, we're we're ahead of the game there.
User Interface: Yeah, that's great for us.
Marketing: yeah, so we're in.
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Marketing: {vocalsound} Yeah. And so personal {gap} what I was just saying like move away from the current remote controls uh like the look and the feel of the current ones and change the look and feel, while still keeping to the company's image, basically. So yeah.
Project Manager: Okay.
Marketing: {gap}. I had to say {disfmarker}
User Interface: Right.
Marketing: So we're moving in the right direction like {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Alright, yeah, no, this i this is good,
User Interface: Yeah.
Project Manager: so through all that we've {disfmarker} we go we're {disfmarker} right, we're gonna go go back to um going with the kinetic thing,
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} Yep.
User Interface: Yeah, that's great.
Project Manager: that's great, using the spongy rubber that we were talking about that anti-R_S_I_ you can {disfmarker} as you squeeze it you are not only therapeuticising yourself, you are charging the batteries {vocalsound},
Marketing: {vocalsound} Mm.
Project Manager: and um I'm not sure about the buttons being in the shape of fruit though.
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} No vegetables.
Marketing: {vocalsound}
User Interface: Yeah, I don't know how we incorporate {disfmarker}
Project Manager: {gap}.
Marketing: {vocalsound}
User Interface: We don't have to follow every trend, I guess.
Marketing: Maybe make it like fruity colours or something.
User Interface: Uh-huh.
Marketing: Some sort. Or {disfmarker}
User Interface: The power button could be like a big apple or something.
Marketing: Mm.
Industrial Designer: Well yeah, but Apple would sue you for that.
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Yeah, this is true {gap}. {vocalsound}
User Interface: They don they don't own {vocalsound} all images of apples. {vocalsound}
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: {gap} sued the Beatles so {disfmarker} {vocalsound}
User Interface: Okay, we'll make it a uh pomegranate, a big pomegranate.
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Well, okay, it seems like the only thing that we haven't really finally um agreed on is its image. Like, yeah, we're we're saying no we don't want it to be fruit and vegetables, but we dunno what it should be,
User Interface: {gap}.
Project Manager: or like are we going {disfmarker} yeah it looks slick, but what do what do we mean by slick sort of thing?
Marketing: Well {vocalsound} {disfmarker} I think, if it's rubber it needs to be
Project Manager: I mean you said earlier on i {vocalsound} it should be funky.
Marketing: different. I think, it's {disfmarker} it should be {disfmarker} I mean, what do you associate with rubber? You know like
Project Manager: {vocalsound} L keep it clean, keep it clean. {vocalsound}
Marketing: really different colours basically.
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Marketing: Okay, sor I sorry, I used the wrong word, what do you associate with the mate the material {vocalsound} that material? {vocalsound} Um {vocalsound} {gap} {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Marketing: Um like I'm just thinking bright colours.
User Interface: Yeah.
Marketing: Bright natural colours, nothing too {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Bright, but not too bright. {vocalsound}
Marketing: Bright, but too {disfmarker} not {disfmarker} yeah.
User Interface: Yeah.
Marketing: {vocalsound} Like no lime green or bright yellow or bright pink. Wanna make it different colours so {vocalsound} anybody can choo like like {gap} {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Like the volume buttons should be the {disfmarker} all the same colour and the d and the the channel buttons should be one colour and stuff like that, do you mean?
User Interface: Mm.
Marketing: Yeah. And on the back of it have the logo.
Project Manager: Okay, what {gap}?
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
User Interface: Sure.
Industrial Designer: Why not?
Project Manager: Okay. Tha
User Interface: The one thing I'm wondering about, I hope that we're not going like too much down a gimmicky road of of having {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Yeah, I mean we {disfmarker} that's we we {disfmarker}
User Interface: I mean if somebody go goes into the store they're gonna see like three or four normal remotes, and then a big spongy pink t tomato uh remote.
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Yeah.
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: {vocalsound} This is the remote control tomato. {vocalsound}
User Interface: I mean {vocalsound} what are ninety per cent of people gonna take? {vocalsound}
Marketing: Well {vocalsound} {disfmarker} I can say in this country, you'll get, you know, lots of people wanting something really funky and cool. Like {disfmarker} and kids will be walking in with their parents saying, Mummy I wanna buy that one.
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
Marketing: {vocalsound} And uh parents will see the will see the pro as well, because it's um like kids won't break it, it's not breakable if you throw it around.
Project Manager: Yeah.
Marketing: Especially with younger kids, you know they can pick it up and and {disfmarker} Yeah. The only thing is is that really small kids might chew on it, but {vocalsound} {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Well, it's it's gotta be chew proof. {vocalsound}
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Marketing: Yeah.
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: {gap} I'm gonna write that down.
Marketing: So {vocalsound}
User Interface: {vocalsound} {gap}
Marketing: so it's rea it's quite
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
Marketing: it's quite like um user friendly
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Marketing: and also for different families, like like family use as well, so for little kids and for old ki like teenagers will like it, I think. Especially maybe younger girls if it's in pink they'll be like {gap} pink remote control for their room something.
Project Manager: So, what are you saying, maybe we should market it in different colours for different {disfmarker}
Marketing: Yeah.
Project Manager: so we could do like the pink range, the blue range, the green range, the {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: That's {disfmarker} yeah.
User Interface: Mm.
Marketing: So like you walk in, you're like, oh I like that remote control, because it's so bright, and then, and then the shop assistant comes up and says, oh what colour would you like? and then they go like, oh I can choose the colour {vocalsound} wow. So it puts, I think, even the customer into more control over what they're buying instead of, you've got all colour it's either that or nothing. So they also get to pick. Well, personally I like walking into a shop and choosing a colour.
User Interface: Yeah I mean, that that seems to work well with for products like iPod,
Marketing: It's um {disfmarker}
User Interface: where, you know, you have a variety of colours, that people feel like they're customising it when they buy it, even, you know, just just by the fact of choosing.
Project Manager: Mm.
Marketing: Yeah. Mm.
Industrial Designer: Although I'd be curious to see how many uh {disfmarker}
Marketing: D you've got the {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: You know, there are some colours that I wouldn I would never choose, and I would be curious how many people choose that colour.
Project Manager: Well that's that can be down to bit of market researching you know,
User Interface: Right.
Project Manager: if that's easy enough to find out what colours are more popular.
Industrial Designer: Mm.
User Interface: Yeah.
Industrial Designer: And produce less of the silly colours, maybe.
Project Manager: Mm.
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Okay. Alright. Well um, we'll {disfmarker} alright let's {disfmarker} what we're gonna aim to get together by the next meeting then um {vocalsound} is from you Catherine wi your y y you know you're gonna be working on the the look and feel design.
Industrial Designer: Yep.
Project Manager: Um Gabriel, you're gonna be working on, you know {disfmarker} come up with the the user interface design. Then basically, you two are gonna be working together on this. You won't be going off to your separate offices.
Industrial Designer: Alright.
User Interface: Okay.
Project Manager: Um and I think you are gonna get a chance to play with some clay.
User Interface: {vocalsound} Oh right.
Project Manager: I think, yeah, it's gonna {vocalsound} you know,
Industrial Designer: Mm.
Project Manager: come up ki you know, be ab for the next meeting be able to come in and show us some some i some physical ideas.'Cause at the moment, uh you know, it's it's hard.
Industrial Designer: Cool.
Project Manager: We were kinda going, yeah, it's gotta feel nice, it's gotta look cool and that it's {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: It is.
User Interface: Yeah.
Project Manager: you know now we can actually start, you know, s some sort of physical something or other.
User Interface: That sounds good.
Project Manager: Um and you're gonna be working on the product evaluation.
Marketing: {vocalsound} Evaluation.
Project Manager: Um. {vocalsound} And I {vocalsound} will be uh
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: talking to the bosses, basically, and uh
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: f fielding off some more spam and uh
Industrial Designer: Great.
Project Manager: that's it really. Keeping things t well, uh you know, ho hopefully uh keeping things together. Um. Yeah, that's {disfmarker} This is this is uh good. So we know for definite we know we've we've now got some definite things going on. We definitely know how it's powered,
User Interface: Mm.
Project Manager: we definitely know that um it's gonna be a simple buttons, we're not gonna be going for the new technological chip on print expensive things, so we've we're keeping the costs down. It's this rubber casing that we can sell as um fun and funky. Don't know of any other remote controls that are made out of this stuff.
Marketing: Mm.
Project Manager: People, you know, people are saying, oh, standard stuff gives you repetitive strain injury, well this remote control is designed to do the complete opposite,
Marketing: Yeah.
Project Manager: It's supposed to fix it rather than cause it. Um. {gap} you know, we're gonna we we're gonna as a sort of extra something on it, you know what what extra things {disfmarker} are there extra things this product have? We'll look into this lock key
User Interface: Right.
Project Manager: facility, although whether or not it happens, {vocalsound} or is possible, I don't know, but something to look into. Okay. I think that's um {disfmarker} well done everybody. Anyone have any uh any questions,
User Interface: Alright.
Project Manager: everyone know what they're doing?'Cause if you don't, you'll {disfmarker} I'm sure you'll soon get an e-mail about it.
User Interface: Yeah. {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
User Interface: Yeah.
Marketing: {vocalsound}
User Interface: Mm, I think we all know what we need to do now.
Marketing: S This gives you all the details?
Project Manager: Okay. right well.
User Interface: Okay.
Project Manager: It's um we're we've still couple of minutes until our meeting's due to finish. But um I got a note saying that you two who are gonna be working together {disfmarker}
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: so bef before you all disappear off just
User Interface: Okay, I'll stay in here.
Marketing: {gap} {vocalsound} um.
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: hold hold fire. Um.
User Interface: Does the pay-raise immediately come into effect on our next pay-check, or is that {disfmarker}
Project Manager: {vocalsound} Um I think, it's uh, yeah, I think, it's gonna be par part more of a profit sharing on the product.
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Marketing: {vocalsound}
User Interface: So we're buying fut I mean, we're getting futures in the company {gap}. {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Yeah, I think i I think that's I think that's the way it's gonna happen at the moment. {vocalsound}
User Interface: {vocalsound} So we really have a incentive to make this remote work.
Project Manager: Yeah. Yeah.
User Interface: I'd like to share in the coffee machine profits, because that's really doing well.
Project Manager: I want a share in the space rocket. Did you {gap} see that this k that this company {gap} we've made a spaceship.
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
User Interface: Yeah. {vocalsound} {gap}.
Marketing: Yeah. {vocalsound}
User Interface: This company has its its fingers in a lot of different pots. {vocalsound}
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Yeah. {vocalsound} Yeah.
Marketing: Mm.
User Interface: Yeah, we're definitely not in the money making department.
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: {gap}.
User Interface: Well I I did notice looking at {disfmarker} I mean, they told you that they wanted whatev our product to represent the the R_R_ brand and and to be immediately noticeable.
Project Manager: Yeah.
User Interface: I mean, if you look like at the coffee maker at the at the corporate web page, it's not obvious.
Marketing: Mm.
User Interface: R_R_. Well it is to us, because we we worked worked here for years and we use that coffee machine, but it's {disfmarker} doesn't have the colour scheme of of the of the company anywhere on it obviously it's just sil silver and black.
Project Manager: Mm.
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} That's true.
Project Manager: And the spaceship doesn't have the R_ {vocalsound} {gap} have a massive R_ and R_ down the side of it
User Interface: No.
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} Doesn't {disfmarker}
Project Manager: but {disfmarker} I still want one. {vocalsound}
User Interface: Mm. {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Okay. Um I've just had a sign flashing up saying, finish the meeting.
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
Project Manager: Uh {vocalsound}.
User Interface: Okay.
Project Manager: Yeah.
User Interface: Right, well, I guess that's us.
Project Manager: Yeah. It's not telling {disfmarker} it's not saying do anything in particular just yet. So maybe you should go back to your own offices.
User Interface: Okay. Right.
Industrial Designer: Are we taking these off?
Project Manager: Yeah. Yeah, it says you two {disfmarker}","They discussed the energy source, which can be a basic battery, a hand dynamo, a kinetic provision of energy like that on watches, or a combination of battery and solar power. Each kind of energy source has its own advantages and disadvantages. The basic battery costs less, and the kinetic provision of energy could be cooler and fancier. Regarding the design of the case, Industrial Designer claimed that it could be a general fact one, a curved one or a double curved one which is more ergonomic. Concerning the material of the case, Industrial Designer claimed that it could be plastic, latex, rubber, wood or titanium. At last they decided that the control is going to be a double curved rubber case, with rubber push-buttons and basic battery.",qmsum
"Summarize the group discussion about the presentation on the prototype.
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Okay. Good afternoon again.
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: So we should have our final meeting about the detail designed of {disfmarker} detail design of the product of the remote control. Um {vocalsound} So here is the agenda for today. Uh uh just going to go quickly through the minutes of the last last uh meeting then we have a p presentation of prototype of you two, sounds interesting. And we'll have um {vocalsound} presentation of evaluation crit criteria by ou our Marketing Experts. Then we'll have to go through finance evaluation of the of the cost of the thing and um hopefully uh we should fit the target o tw of twelve point five uh uh Euro. {vocalsound} Okay. So let's go. Uh if I go quickly through the minutes of the last meeting. {vocalsound} So we went through th uh w we took this following decisions. No L_C_D_, no speech recognition technology, okay, we went through a b to a banana look and feel for the remote control. We went through the use of wheels and but buttons. {vocalsound} And also the use of a basis station for battery ch charging and uh also to um call the to call the mot mote remote control when it is lost. Okay. Um. Good. So guys let {gap} this uh wonderful thing.
Industrial Designer: Okay so we can go to the slides.
Project Manager: {vocalsound} Oh yeah. Sorry. Um.
Industrial Designer: Yeah. Number three. Oh number two sorry.
Project Manager: Which is {gap} {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: So final design. Final design. Okay so Michael you can go ahead.
User Interface: Yeah so uh following our decision to uh make a yellow {disfmarker} well to make a banana
Project Manager: Yeah can you show it to the the camera maybe.
User Interface: remote {disfmarker} okay so we actually have a {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: You can pull it out first, maybe.
User Interface: We've {disfmarker} well first first of all we made a an attractive {vocalsound} base station uh with a banana leaf uh look and feel um and uh
Project Manager: Mm-hmm. {vocalsound}
User Interface: bana sit {disfmarker} the banana sits in there k you know nicely weighted so that it's not gonna tip over and um this is the remote itself, it's kind of it's it's ergonomic, it fits in the hand uh rather well. We've got the two uh {vocalsound} uh scroll wheels here which you know one on the the left for the uh volume and the one on the right for for the channel and uh underneath {vocalsound} we have the uh the turbo button which is in like a nice uh trigger position for you know for pressing quite naturally.
Project Manager: What's the use uh of the t turbo button already?
User Interface: This is when you when you uh are scrolling the uh {disfmarker} through the channels you can tell it to to skip th past channels that you {disfmarker} quickly rather th
Project Manager: Ah yeah yeah an then you stop when you stop it stops.
User Interface: Yeah. Well when you stop scrolling the wheel it stops. But normally with uh {disfmarker} it will just uh s stay on each station briefly so you can see the the picture.
Industrial Designer: Uh {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Uh-huh.
Industrial Designer: And we we do have one more functionality. If you take the banana as such and uh you press the turbo button, so it switch ons the switch ons the T_V_.
User Interface: The T_V_ yeah.
Project Manager: Which one?
User Interface: The s the turbo button.
Industrial Designer: The turbo button.
Project Manager: Okay.
User Interface: So rather than having uh an extra button for um for the on off switch you just use the turbo button.
Industrial Designer: Additional button.
Marketing: What this button for?
User Interface: This is a teletext button. So once you press that then you get teletext
Marketing: Okay.
User Interface: and you can use the the channel selector scroll wheel as uh {disfmarker}
Project Manager: To navigate it through th through teletext.
User Interface: To navigate yeah.
Marketing: But if you want to go to page seven hundred?
Industrial Designer: That's right, that's right.
User Interface: Yeah.
Project Manager: {gap} with the wheel it's easy.
Marketing: How man
User Interface: Well then you can you you have like a little uh number selection thing, you press the {gap} the the teletext button uh to move between uh the fields and then you can just scroll the number back and forth so you have s you go {disfmarker} you scroll to seven and then zero zero and then you can uh {disfmarker}
Marketing: I don't understand it. Can you repeat it? {vocalsound}
User Interface: {vocalsound} Well you can you can press press the teletext button
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
User Interface: and then you then you can you can f
Industrial Designer: So then then both the scroll buttons they are for teletext browsing.
Marketing: Yeah.
Industrial Designer: And you can tele
Marketing: Ah okay okay. Okay. Okay okay.
Industrial Designer: yeah,
User Interface: Mm uh {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: once you press the teletext button then the scroll buttons they are more for teletext, they are no more for channel or vol volume.
Marketing: Okay. I see. I see. Okay. Okay.
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
User Interface: {vocalsound} And this is the uh the infrared uh port.
Industrial Designer: That's right.
User Interface: Also the top of the banana.
Project Manager: Excellent.
User Interface: So. And then we have
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
User Interface: in the uh in the base station we have the the button at the front for uh for calling the uh the banana.
Project Manager: Calling. Excellent.
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
Project Manager: And the the leaves plays the roles of of antennas?
User Interface: Actually they do.
Project Manager: Oh.
User Interface: That's that's yeah that's uh that's form and function in the one in the one uh object.
Industrial Designer: Yeah. So it always means, whatever the rays goes by they they get reflected and then you are having a better coverage.
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: It's like antennas.
User Interface: Yeah. So.
Marketing: {gap}
User Interface: But yeah that's um that's just like {disfmarker} that's an attractive um base station.
Project Manager: Great. {vocalsound}
User Interface: {vocalsound} So.
Project Manager: So, what else?
User Interface: Okay.
Industrial Designer: And for the power source we are having solar cells and rechargeable batteries and this and uh the basis station is going to have the input from the mm power line for for charging the batteries.
Marketing: {vocalsound} Is it really weight? Is it light or {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: It is very light.
Project Manager: Yeah, they're light.
User Interface: It's it's uh it's about the weight of a banana.
Marketing: Okay.
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
Marketing: Okay.
User Interface: You know, to give you the correct look and feel.
Project Manager: {gap}
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
Marketing: Ok
Industrial Designer: And we have put these different colours so that people don't mistake them mistake it as a banana.
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: Otherwise it's you know a child comes and so {disfmarker}
Marketing: Okay. Yeah yeah yeah, I see. I under I understand.
User Interface: I think a child would try to eat it anyway, so maybe we should
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
User Interface: consider that. {gap} maybe health and safety aspects.
Project Manager: Ah yeah.
Industrial Designer: Mm-hmm.
User Interface: {gap}
Industrial Designer: Oh we didn't think of that yet. Yeah.
User Interface: Yeah.
Project Manager: So for the power source, apparently you still {disfmarker} you you want to use both solar cells and batteries.
Industrial Designer: Oh yeah that's right.
Project Manager: Uh you mean {disfmarker} okay. So {disfmarker}
User Interface: I don't really know if the solar cells are actually necessary any more if you have a recharging base station.
Project Manager: Yeah, where are going to {disfmarker} where are you are you going to place them?
Industrial Designer: Mm-hmm mm-hmm. It'll It'll be always at top somewhere at there.
User Interface: If I was gonna place them I'd put them on the on the top here since that's like uh the black bit
Project Manager: You have enough surface? You {gap} {disfmarker}
User Interface: but yeah I don't I really don't think it's necessary to have the solar cells anymore.
Industrial Designer: Yeah because now we are having rechargeable batteries
Project Manager: Okay.
User Interface: Mm.
Industrial Designer: so that that is {gap}.
Project Manager: What will be the autonomy? Roughly?
User Interface: The what sorry?
Project Manager: The autonomy. Autonomy.
User Interface: What do you mean?
Project Manager: Uh I mean how long does i how how how long can it be held off a station?
Marketing: How long the {disfmarker} how long the bit the batteries long.
User Interface: Ah. Ah. A long time.
Project Manager: Yeah. A long {disfmarker} {vocalsound}
User Interface: {vocalsound} No no no,
Industrial Designer: Eight to ten eight to ten hours.
Marketing: {vocalsound}
User Interface: it can {disfmarker} it should be weeks.
Industrial Designer: N most {disfmarker} no most of the time it's not being used.
Project Manager: Yeah, so it's {disfmarker}
User Interface: Yeah but y people don't like to put it back in the base station all the time people leave wanna leave it on the couch so {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: So when when you are making it on {disfmarker}
Project Manager: It's used only when you {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Mm. Mm-hmm. No eight or eight or ten hours of working.
User Interface: Ah, okay.
Industrial Designer: If you are just leaving like that it'll be much longer.
User Interface: Okay.
Project Manager: Yeah. F weeks.
User Interface: Yeah.
Industrial Designer: Yeah. That's right.
Project Manager: Right. Next slide?
Industrial Designer: Yeah. And we are having the speakers regular chip for control. Pricing is {disfmarker} was a factor so that's why we have gone for a regular chip only not the advanced chip. And uh that's it.
Project Manager: Okay. {gap} Okay. Those really sounds very good.
Industrial Designer: That's right.
Project Manager: {vocalsound} Nothing else to add?
User Interface: It seems to be falling over.
Marketing: I l yeah.
Project Manager: Yeah.
Marketing: I like I like it. Maybe the the thing that convince me the less is the {vocalsound} the multifunctional buttons. Looks a bit {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: You want to have more functional buttons?
Marketing: Looks a bit puzzled uh I dunno how to say {vocalsound} that.
Industrial Designer: You are not convinced.
Marketing: You {disfmarker} the the b the buttons change h h their function depending if y it's teletext or not {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Not not many, we we want to keep it simple. So that this button fo is for teletext which is usually also the case, that usually there is a teletext button and once you press that, the channel buttons, they baco become the scrolling buttons.
Marketing: And the volume button will will become {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: It's up to you, means.
Project Manager: Well in fact b both will be {disfmarker} could be useful, navigating through teletext.
Industrial Designer: Now that {disfmarker} Means let's say this this can move the the larger digits and this can move the smaller digits.
User Interface: Or can move between positions in the in the number.
Industrial Designer: That's right.
Project Manager: Yeah.
Marketing: And what about people who want to use digits? Butto real buttons?
Project Manager: Wow.
Industrial Designer: Yeah. So there was there was a constraint that the surface area which we have on this banana on one side because of the shape.
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: So we are targeting a segment which is which is just very trendy kind of thing, they they don't care about the buttons any more. And anyway {disfmarker}
Marketing: Okay. Because have you thought about configuration and all this kind of uh stuff?
User Interface: It's all automatic.
Marketing: It's all automatic.
User Interface: Yep.
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Marketing: {vocalsound} Okay. {vocalsound} Okay yeah it's fine.
Project Manager: Very good uh yeah {disfmarker}
Marketing: W we are living in a wonderful world. {vocalsound}
Project Manager: {vocalsound} you th yeah.
User Interface: Uh. {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: {vocalsound} Bananas everywhere.
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Okay, so {disfmarker} {vocalsound}
Marketing: Automatically configure {gap}. {vocalsound}
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: So we have to go through now evaluations.
Industrial Designer: Evalua yeah.
Marketing: Yeah.
Project Manager: {vocalsound} So your slides are ready?
Marketing: S
Project Manager: Uh you're four I think.
Marketing: Yeah.
Project Manager: So this is one, which one is this one?
Marketing: Yeah.
Project Manager: {vocalsound} {vocalsound}
Marketing: Okay. I {vocalsound} I const I constructed a a list of criteria based on the on the general user requirements. And each criteria is {vocalsound} will be evaluated it's uh logical criteria so we must users must say i if it's true or is {disfmarker} or if it's false in a in a scale ranging from zero to seven.
Industrial Designer: Why this strange factor of seven?
Marketing: Because i I'm sorry. Sorry.
Industrial Designer: Usually I have seen that scales are from one to ten.
Marketing: Ah yeah. It's from {disfmarker} sorry, it's from one to seven. It's from from one to seven sorry. Because it should be an even it should be an even uh scale,
Industrial Designer: Okay.
Project Manager: Num number {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Okay. Mm-hmm.
Marketing: and five is too short and nine is too long.
Industrial Designer: Okay.
Marketing: {vocalsound} I'm a I I'm {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Okay fine, got the idea.
Project Manager: So to have {disfmarker} in order to have enough granularity {disfmarker}
Marketing: Sorry?
Project Manager: it's in order to have enough granularity in the evaluation.
Marketing: Yeah yeah.
Industrial Designer: Okay.
Marketing: The variance is mi it's is minimal.
Project Manager: Okay.
Industrial Designer: Okay, okay, great.
Marketing: I'm um answering your question.
Industrial Designer: Okay. Yeah yeah.
Marketing: Okay.
Industrial Designer: Go ahead.
Marketing: {vocalsound} And that's the criteria I I found more useful. I think I sh I {vocalsound} I could write the criteria in the on the whiteboard?
Industrial Designer: Mm-hmm. Sure.
Marketing: And we all four could range
Industrial Designer: Okay. Yeah yeah. Yeah.
Marketing: could evaluate the {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Okay.
Marketing: {gap}
Industrial Designer: So you can say fancy, handy. Handy.
Marketing: Okay let's let's evaluate if it's fancy or {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Yeah, it's fancy, according to me.
Marketing: Seven but {disfmarker} {vocalsound}
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Yeah, six.
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: S seven.
Industrial Designer: Seven. Seven by me.
Project Manager: Six.
Marketing: I would say seven.
Industrial Designer: Okay.
Marketing: It's quite fancy.
Industrial Designer: So you can add seven plus six plus seven plus {disfmarker}
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: No, wait.
User Interface: Yeah uh five.
Project Manager: What do you say seven? Five?
Industrial Designer: Five.
User Interface: Five, maybe maybe maybe six it's it's I guess it's {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Okay, six point five.
User Interface: yeah.
Project Manager: Handy?
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: Again I'll give seven.
Project Manager: Seven.
User Interface: I'd give it a six like I'd I think it's probably more handy than my current remote,'cause of the scroll wheels
Marketing: Six.
Industrial Designer: Yep.
User Interface: but maybe loses the point for not having you know the extra buttons when you reall if you do need them for some reason but you know you can always use your other remote.
Project Manager: So seven, seven,
Industrial Designer: Seven for me.
Project Manager: six,
User Interface: Yeah.
Marketing: Six.
Project Manager: six point five. Functional. {vocalsound} {vocalsound}
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: I'll give five.
Project Manager: Four.
Marketing: I would say {disfmarker} {vocalsound}
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: {gap}
User Interface: Well it depends when you say functional, do you mean it does what we want it to do, or d does what it does, you know, can it make you coffee?
Marketing: Everything ar
Project Manager: {vocalsound} Uh for a remote control, does he have all the {gap}
User Interface: You know.
Marketing: Mm everything {disfmarker}
User Interface: {vocalsound} Yeah. Yeah. {gap}
Project Manager: you could expect.
Marketing: It's compared to the all
Industrial Designer: That's right.
Marketing: remote controls.
User Interface: That's before {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: That's right. The standards. What is available in the market off the shelf.
User Interface: Yeah. I have to say four.
Marketing: Actually I don't know what are the r the real specification of a of a universal remote contro
User Interface: Well it's not a universal remote. Remember we're focus we're supposed to focus just on T_V_s.
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} We {disfmarker}
Marketing: Ah it's not an univer but it's for all kind of T_V_s?
Project Manager: Yeah.
User Interface: Well all T_V_s but only T_ {disfmarker} only T_V_s I guess.
Project Manager: {vocalsound} So it's universal but for T_V_s. {vocalsound} So s uh four?
Marketing: Yeah.
Industrial Designer: Five.
Project Manager: Five?
User Interface: Four.
Project Manager: Four.
Marketing: Four. Four.
Industrial Designer: So four point two?
User Interface: Just four.
Project Manager: Four.
Industrial Designer: {gap} four. {vocalsound}
User Interface: {vocalsound} Obviously there are some outliers so {disfmarker}
Marketing: So four?
Project Manager: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Okay cool? Cool device.
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: There I'll give it seven.
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
Marketing: It means cool features, like new features actually.
Industrial Designer: That's right.
User Interface: {vocalsound} Which {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: For a T_V_ the most important feature which I felt was the locator which is a cool feature. And then the scroll buttons are again cool features. We don't have L_C_D_ for it but that we decided we don't want to have.
Project Manager: Yeah. Seven.
Marketing: I would say five.
User Interface: I'll say five.
Project Manager: Six.
Industrial Designer: Mm-hmm. Seven.
Project Manager: Plus six, I say {disfmarker} I said seven.
User Interface: Yeah.
Project Manager: So it's six.
User Interface: S yeah.
Marketing: You said seven? {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Yeah.
User Interface:'Cause it's five five seven seven so {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Okay.
User Interface: Uh, okay, definitely easy to use.
Industrial Designer: Definitely seven.
User Interface: Seven.
Project Manager: Seven. Seven. And you? Outl you are not lik outlier.
Marketing: Five. {vocalsound}
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Seven {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: {vocalsound} Okay okay okay okay.
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} Okay.
Marketing: Sorry, I have them {disfmarker}
User Interface: Alright, now here's the sixty million Dollar question,
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
User Interface: well, twenty five twenty five Euro question.
Project Manager: Of course I'll buy the {gap} banana. {gap}
User Interface: What do you what do you guys reckon?
Marketing: {vocalsound} Of cour Of course the most difficult question for the end. {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Well {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: I'll say five.
User Interface: Hmm.
Industrial Designer: I'll say five.
Project Manager: Twenty five Euros. {vocalsound} Cheap.
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Marketing: I find it quite cheap {vocalsound} actually.
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Marketing: I dunno. If i i it depends, if you live in in Switzerland or you live in {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Yeah, so the target price is for all Europe, or only for rich countries? {vocalsound} It's more targeting U_K_ or {disfmarker}
Marketing: I don't know. Wha the initial specifications were for the whole all Europe or {disfmarker}
User Interface: {vocalsound} Uh {disfmarker}
Project Manager: So this is selling costs, not production costs.
User Interface: Yeah. Yeah.
Marketing: Yeah this is the the initial specifications.
Project Manager: Yeah yeah sure. Um {disfmarker} Five.
Marketing: I would say six. It's quite cheap actually.
User Interface: I'd say two.
Project Manager: {vocalsound} Aw, should be nice in your {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Why?
User Interface: {vocalsound} I don't want a banana on my {vocalsound} living room table, a banana remote.
Marketing: {gap}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} No but it's really handy actually if you see.
User Interface: It is handy, it's handy, but it it's terrible.
Industrial Designer: It's it's so handy. And then {disfmarker}
Project Manager: {vocalsound} It's kitsch.
Industrial Designer: Anyb anybody who comes here {vocalsound} {disfmarker} anybody who comes to your home he'll at least ask once what is this.
User Interface: {vocalsound} Yeah. Yeah, but it's not a positive thing.
Industrial Designer: It's a very positive thing if you see like that {vocalsound}.
User Interface: Well, you know, it's it's handy, it's ergonomic, but it's a banana.
Project Manager: Well, don't forget well, don't for don't forget who we're targeting also who are f f who are wh
Industrial Designer: Youngsters.
Project Manager: yeah, youngst youngst
User Interface: Yeah but it says I, I would buy this, so.
Marketing: Actually maybe {disfmarker}
Project Manager: No {disfmarker} well {disfmarker} yeah {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} if you would be young.
Marketing: Yeah {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Not telling that you are young. Li li like a teenager for instance.
User Interface: {vocalsound} No, it's I. I would buy {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Okay you're you're crazy teenager and you like fun things.
Industrial Designer: You want to flaunt.
Project Manager: Yeah.
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: You {disfmarker} with your girlfriend or something.
Project Manager: Yeah, you want to show the beautiful banana you have. {gap}
User Interface: S s
Industrial Designer: Or might be it does some other kind of thing but {disfmarker}
User Interface: Still I I'd say two. I don't think I {disfmarker} at any stage in my life I would want a banana remote control, really.
Industrial Designer: Uh yeah, crazy.
Project Manager: Okay so you s you give {disfmarker}
User Interface: I can say, maybe there is a market for it, I dunno.
Project Manager: oh yeah yeah I know I know.
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: So you say two.
User Interface: {vocalsound} Yeah.
Industrial Designer: I say five.
Project Manager: F I d I say five. You say?
Marketing: I change the question. {vocalsound}
Project Manager: {vocalsound} So what's the new question?
Industrial Designer: And you have saved it?
Marketing: So yeah upload the {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: You'll have to reload.
Project Manager: Uh yeah, I think so. {vocalsound}
User Interface: Okay, so, it depends if uh {disfmarker}
Marketing: Yeah it's two different situations. If you really need an universal remote control or if you would change your remote control for a n for a new one.
Project Manager: Yeah that's two different question.
User Interface: If I had t if I had to spend twenty five Euro, if that was like my limit, maybe I would buy it. Because the other twenty five Euro remote controls are probably gonna look
Project Manager: Ugly.
User Interface: worse than a banana. {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: They're not going to be as {disfmarker} And they they might not be a as easy as this {disfmarker}
Marketing: {vocalsound}
User Interface: And it {disfmarker} yeah this is gonna f you know handy to use.
Industrial Designer: yeah. Yeah.
Marketing: So? What now? What range?
Project Manager: I stick to five.
Industrial Designer: S
User Interface: Although it still has it still has the word of course at the beginning {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: I go slightly up. Six.
Marketing: Six.
User Interface: so I dunno. Um.
Project Manager: W we have six, five {disfmarker}
User Interface: {vocalsound} I'd give it I'd give it a
Project Manager: Three {vocalsound}
User Interface: I give it a four now.
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Marketing: {vocalsound} Six? Six?
Project Manager: So we are six, five, four {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Six, five, four.
Marketing: Six, so it's uh five point five, or less.
Project Manager: Yeah. So {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Okay.
Project Manager: So and last question, will I change my rem change my remote control from Mando banana. Um, zero. No uh we can't. {vocalsound}
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: So one.
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Marketing: Actually yeah, I {disfmarker} we {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Well if {gap}.
User Interface: {vocalsound} Yeah.
Project Manager: No uh let's say I'll put two.
User Interface: I'd say three, I mean my remote control is kinda {disfmarker} at home is pretty terrible. If it was {disfmarker} change my remote control of my D_V_D_ player for a Mando banana then I would be more inclined to
Project Manager: It's for the T_V_.
User Interface: but uh {disfmarker}'cause it's really bad but uh {vocalsound}
Marketing: {vocalsound}
User Interface: I'd say a three. {gap}
Industrial Designer: I'll still give it five. Yeah.
Marketing: Five?
Project Manager: Two three five two three fi and two.
Marketing: {gap} You are romantic, really.
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} So it's somewhere three point five I think.
Marketing: {vocalsound} I would say two.
Project Manager: So it's r Yeah, three point five. {vocalsound}
Marketing: Who is the outlier?
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Marketing: Wh wh {vocalsound} you said five?
Project Manager: {vocalsound} No no you say five, he is the outlier.
Industrial Designer: No I said five.
Project Manager: Okay just just do a sum.
Marketing: I don't know if {vocalsound} it's a {disfmarker}
User Interface: It's not very promising but you know we're not young trendsetters. {vocalsound}
Marketing: No because there are more {disfmarker} yeah, we shouldn't sum like that.
Project Manager: Well maybe we should we should uh have a look globally glob
Marketing: Because the the last two questions is much more important than the rest actually.
Industrial Designer: Mm-hmm.
Marketing: Otherwise we wouldn't {disfmarker} we will not sell.
User Interface: Is there some some formula you're using that says you have to sum them up?
Marketing: Uh no I didn't {gap} anything. {vocalsound} {vocalsound}
User Interface: Well just leave it at that then.
Project Manager: Yeah.
Industrial Designer: Oops.
Project Manager: So maybe maybe w we can we should stick to general feeling. We can had uh have a {disfmarker} out of these numbers, which which is that well we should go for it.
Marketing: Yeah, the uh {disfmarker} Yeah.
Project Manager: {vocalsound} Problem with connectors? {vocalsound}
Marketing: Do you want me to sum
User Interface: No.
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} Yeah it's it's funny. {vocalsound}
Marketing: o I think it's not {disfmarker}
User Interface: I think it it kind of you just lose information if you sum it, so.
Project Manager: Okay. So let's move uh let's move on.
Industrial Designer: Yeah, sure.
Project Manager: {vocalsound} Okay, {gap} now now we have to mm to estimate {vocalsound} uh the cost okay. So I prepare an Excel sh uh an Excel sheet. Um well we are going to calculate the production costs. We should we should be below twelve point five. So I already uh put some pu some numbers here, okay. We are going to go through {vocalsound} {disfmarker} so this is the number the mm number of components we need for this thing. So it appears that there were things that we didn't thought about. Uh and also things that I uh I d I forget to uh to put like solar cells.
User Interface: Well we decided against the solar cells so {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Mm-hmm.
Project Manager: Oh yeah finally we say no.
Industrial Designer: Solar cells, yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah, we said no to that.
Project Manager: Okay so let's let's go let's go let go through all the lines. So hand dynamo. This something we didn't thought about. But {disfmarker}
User Interface: You mean, charging it by shaking the banana.
Project Manager: Yeah.
Industrial Designer: I think rechargeable batteries will take care of the power thing.
Project Manager: Yeah.
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
Project Manager: Okay so we we stick to battery, one.
Industrial Designer: To bring the cost {disfmarker} Yeah.
Project Manager: No kinetic also. I don't I don't see the difference between kinetic and dynamo.
User Interface: Well maybe dynamo is like you have to actually {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Ah you have to {disfmarker} ah okay I see so kinetic is really uh shaking the banana.
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Marketing: S
User Interface: Yeah.
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
Project Manager: {vocalsound} Crazy. Okay. So those banana is falling. Let's go ahead. So we we st only have one for battery. Uh then for electronics um so I didn't put anything for the {gap}.
Industrial Designer: So we have the regular chip on the print, which is one.
Project Manager: Yeah. Yeah.
Industrial Designer: And that's it.
Project Manager: Okay. No {disfmarker} so we hin
Industrial Designer: And we have sample speaker.
Project Manager: Yeah so one.
Industrial Designer: Yeah. Yeah. {gap} the cost of that is very high.
Project Manager: Ooh ye ye ye the cost is increasing. So we are {disfmarker}
User Interface: Well actually that that {disfmarker} no that sample speaker is not {disfmarker} we we're not using that, we're just using the the very beep {disfmarker} simple beep,
Project Manager: The beep.
User Interface: that s that sample thing is like the voice recording and everything.
Industrial Designer: Uh-huh.
Project Manager: That's what {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.
Project Manager: Okay so I'll remove it.
User Interface: So {disfmarker} Yeah.
Project Manager: S
User Interface: I say that {disfmarker} Yeah.
Project Manager: So don't we need a {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: And we have sev
Project Manager: Oh there is no listing for r radio frequency thing.
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
Project Manager: So {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: So we we'll put some extras, if there is something.
Project Manager: Yeah maybe. We'll see later.
User Interface: Mm.
Project Manager: Okay so in {disfmarker} for the case um {vocalsound} I put single curved.
Industrial Designer: Okay. To reduce the cost, it's okay.
User Interface: {vocalsound} Well, wait a second,
Project Manager: Because we have two things.
User Interface: no, it's it's double curved, it's got a c, it's uh {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Oh it's got all the directions
Project Manager: No.
Industrial Designer: so don't worry. {vocalsound}
User Interface: Well d yeah it's monotonic {vocalsound} but
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: It's got a {gap} direction. {vocalsound}
User Interface: it's got {disfmarker} but if you hold it if you hold it that way that's two curved, one on this side, one on that side, but they're opposite sides.
Project Manager: Well. What a {disfmarker} what i if I put one here.
User Interface: This is actually {disfmarker} I mean this probably
Marketing: Actually what's the differen
User Interface: this probably actually costs more than three
Project Manager: Yeah so let's put one here in the {gap} then instead of single
User Interface: if you {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Okay. Okay.
Project Manager: oka all right.
User Interface: Yeah.
Project Manager: So we stick to plastic, it cost nothing.
Industrial Designer: Yeah. That's right.
User Interface: Well {gap} {disfmarker} no didn't we say we wanted to do a rubber {disfmarker}
Project Manager: No, it's too {disfmarker} no.
User Interface: {gap} if you drop it?
Marketing: {vocalsound} Too expensive.
Project Manager: It's too expensive. We're already at eleven.
User Interface: Well when {disfmarker} okay. Well we we'll come back we'll come back and see if we can fit it in.
Project Manager: Okay so I put rubber one. Okay so special colour, yellow.
User Interface: Yeah.
Project Manager: Uh for the interface we have {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: We don't have any push buttons.
User Interface: No, we have two push buttons.
Project Manager: We have three.
Industrial Designer: No that is a scroll wheel itself, it'll be put in that.
User Interface: Huh.
Project Manager: No no. We have two scroll, and we have three push buttons.
Industrial Designer: Ah okay, okay.
User Interface: Uh.
Industrial Designer: Okay, okay.
Project Manager: {vocalsound} And {disfmarker}
User Interface: Okay it's gonna have to be plastic.
Marketing: Actually whe whe when you wrote regular chip you should put two, because there is another chip here.
Project Manager: No it's {gap} no chip. This is just radio frequency {gap}. Th This is no chip.
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
Marketing: Yeah but
Industrial Designer: No. There's no chip there.
Marketing: you need {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: It just emits the signal.
Project Manager: It's just {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: And the receiver accepts it and that's it.
Project Manager: Yeah.
Marketing: Fo i it does nothing actually?
Project Manager: No. Just {disfmarker} only {gap}.
Industrial Designer: Just se sends the signal, that's it.
User Interface: It's a recharger thing and uh {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Okay w we didn't think a thought about uh integrated scroll wheel push buttons.
User Interface: Well I actually did um think about it myself {vocalsound} but I thought you know {disfmarker} because you could potentially you know you could be pushing it down as you scroll it for a {disfmarker} instead of a turbo button
Project Manager: Yeah,
User Interface: but you know the turbo button does add that extra class.
Project Manager: so {disfmarker} Yeah.
User Interface: You know. So I mean if we're if we're over budget then maybe we could we could rethink that.
Project Manager: Okay. So no L_C_D_, so for {disfmarker} we have no button supplements, right?
Industrial Designer: Yep. No.
Project Manager: Uh {vocalsound} well in fact could we could not we consider this button as a button supplement because {disfmarker} oh no, these are these are for colours, co and special forms, special colours and special materials.
User Interface: Yeah. No we're not {disfmarker}
Project Manager: So {disfmarker}
User Interface: we don't need anything special for the buttons.
Project Manager: Okay so we are over budget.
Industrial Designer: Yeah. So first thing which we should take care of is,
User Interface: Make it plastic instead of rubber.
Industrial Designer: instead of rubber, let it be plastic.
Project Manager: Yeah.
User Interface: And then we're basically o on budget except for you know ten cents.
Industrial Designer: And uh that much money will be required for the base station, which is not there.
Project Manager: Yeah.
User Interface: {vocalsound} Yeah.
Project Manager: So mayb in fact n we have to put two here
Marketing: {gap}
Project Manager: because it cost nothing.
User Interface: {vocalsound} Yeah well pl the base station is made out of m many units of {vocalsound} plastic.
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} Yeah.
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: That's right.
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: So might be ninety centimes for the the remaining things which {disfmarker} the cord and everything which'll go {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Exactly exactly so we have margin for that stuff.
User Interface: Does that include charging circuitry and everything? {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: That's right.
Project Manager: Yeah maybe. Okay good. Wha
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
Project Manager: Excellent.
User Interface: So what do we do with the extra profits?
Project Manager: {vocalsound} Um we'll invest in R_ and D_.
User Interface: Okay.
Marketing: {vocalsound}
User Interface: {vocalsound} The next fruit.
Project Manager: Yeah. So well we're under the the the cost. So we can go to {disfmarker} through to project evaluation. {vocalsound}
Marketing: Okay so now we have a product which nobody would would buy. Would {disfmarker} yeah, would buy.
Project Manager: Sorry?
User Interface: No we have a product which none of us would buy. {vocalsound}
Marketing: Yeah because th th the evaluation project {disfmarker}
Project Manager: {vocalsound} Which is different. Which is different. None of us will buy it.
User Interface: No it's people in in in Milan and uh in Paris that are gonna buy it.
Marketing: Ah would buy, yeah.
User Interface: We're n
Marketing: Massively, yeah.
User Interface: yeah. We're not in Milan or Paris.
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Marketing: Yeah. Okay. Uh you have been in Milan a couple of times, so.
Project Manager: This is a battery. {vocalsound}
User Interface: Actually there were a lot of {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Marketing: {vocalsound} And you said the lowest {gap}.
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: This is what we {disfmarker} which you can mm {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: S Detachable battery.
Project Manager: It did {disfmarker} yeah.
User Interface: That's'cause I'm sick of Milan.
Marketing: Yeah, for the batteries {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Extra battery, yeah.
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
User Interface: {vocalsound} Okay so um {vocalsound} project process.
Project Manager: Exac {vocalsound} Well in fact I I did not know {vocalsound} I didn't know really what to say here.
Marketing: {vocalsound}
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: {vocalsound} If uh if you have any ideas of what we can we can say. So I don't I don't I don't understand what what they mean by satisfaction um and for and for example.
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Should it be more like um like a status of of the {disfmarker} these meetings in fact.
User Interface: {gap} Yeah.
Project Manager: Yeah well in fact uh we we use a little bit the white board and the digital pen, not that much.
User Interface: I dunno I think we had a fair bit of creativity.
Project Manager: Oh yeah it's really creative.
User Interface: {vocalsound} And uh but I think one thing we m missed out of this whole process was a um {vocalsound} like a focus group with the actual people we're targeting.
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
User Interface: We needed some of these kind of young trendsetters to come in and play with the banana and you know see if they
Project Manager: Yeah.
Industrial Designer: They like that.
User Interface: see if they like it.
Project Manager: Yeah maybe we should go through, yeah an uh evaluation.
Industrial Designer: Mm-hmm.
User Interface: Because yeah the evaluation for us is is kind of pointless.
Industrial Designer: Biased.
Project Manager: So maybe you should we should do a kinda evaluation {vocalsound} in the streets like asking to young peoples well, do you like to have a banana as a remote control.
User Interface: Yeah. Because it it would also be interesting to uh you to know find out if we have a market in really young children as well, to see you know how to how to market this thing.
Industrial Designer: Mm-hmm.
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Yeah.
Industrial Designer: Mm-hmm.
User Interface:'Cause you know if {disfmarker} well I mean maybe you don't wanna give all your kids their own remote because they'll be changing the channel all the time but you know maybe in some households where there is you know a T_V_ for each kid, then you know, banana remote control could be fun for them as well.
Project Manager: Mm-hmm.
User Interface: Might have to draw a face on it. So but I think that's something we need to to work on next time is really finding out more about the target market.
Project Manager: Yep. Any any new ideas we could uh we could investigate next time? Dunno, oranges?
Industrial Designer: Yeah. The cost of the thing can be made more than might be. Because I think it's just the optimal, what we have done for the cost which we are looking forward to.
User Interface: {vocalsound} Yeah. I think there are ways we could maybe simplify the {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Interface.
User Interface: Well just the the the circuit board that we're using inside,
Marketing: Mm-hmm.
User Interface: I'm not sure really how complicated our um
Industrial Designer: Mm-hmm.
User Interface: our needs are. I mean all we have is two push buttons and two scrollers, do we really need an integrated circuit to
Project Manager: Hmm.
User Interface: you know to process that.
Industrial Designer: Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.
Marketing: So more general remote control instead of just focusing on uh on T_V_.
Industrial Designer: That's right.
Marketing: The complexity shouldn't be much higher.
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
Marketing: For {disfmarker} you said if it good for D_V_D_ then I would {disfmarker}
User Interface: And also fo you know for mood lighting and and stuff, that would be rather cool. I think that's actually something that should be in version two, is the ability to you know to control things other than the T_V_
Industrial Designer: Integrate.
User Interface: and not just electronic equipment but you know the whole environment of the room.
Industrial Designer: Mm-hmm.
Marketing: {gap}
Project Manager: Okay. {vocalsound} Very good. {vocalsound} So {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: So {disfmarker} What else?
Project Manager: Well done. I think we we can go
Industrial Designer: Okay. Home?
Project Manager: home.
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} Happily satisfied. {vocalsound}
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: {vocalsound} Yeah. Maybe maybe we can hassle the the production department to to make a a real prototype that we can use at home to to evaluate.
Industrial Designer: Mm-hmm.
Project Manager: {gap} Okay so thanks very much.
User Interface: Yep.
Project Manager: Bye.
User Interface: {vocalsound} Okay.
Industrial Designer: Thank you.
User Interface: Thank you.
Marketing: Bye.","User Interface and Industrial Designer firstly presented on the prototype features which agreed to have a banana shape with a size that fitted to the hand. Also, they showed the prototype with a leaf base station with a calling button to locate the remote control. As agreed by the group, the prototype would have two scroll wheels to control the volume and the channel, the turbo button that also could be used to turn on the TV, the teletext button to faster switch the channel. Also, the group decided to give up on the solar cells and to use rechargeable batteries for the power source. Concerning the product cost, the group decided to use a regular chip for the speaker.",qmsum
"What did the meeting discuss to assure higher and further education?
Lynne Neagle AM: Good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to the first virtual meeting of the Children, Young People and Education Committee. In accordance with Standing Order 34. 19, I determine that the public are excluded from the committee's meeting, in order to protect public health. In accordance with Standing Order 34. 21, notice of this decision was included in the agenda for this meeting, which was published last Friday. This meeting is, however, being broadcast live on Senedd. tv, with all participants joining via video conference. A record of the proceedings will be published as usual. Aside from the procedural adaptation relating to conducting proceedings remotely, all other Standing Order requirements for committees remain in place. The meeting is bilingual, and simultaneous translation from Welsh to English is available. Can I remind all participants that the microphones will be controlled centrally, so there's no need to turn them on and off individually? Can I ask whether there are any declarations of interest, please? No. Okay. Thank you. Can I just then, again, note for the record that, if, for any reason, I drop out of the meeting, the committee has agreed that Dawn Bowden AM will temporarily chair while I try to rejoin? Item 2, then, this afternoon is an evidence session with the Welsh Government on the impact of the coronavirus epidemic on education in Wales. I'm very pleased to welcome Kirsty Williams AM, Minister for Education, Steve Davies, director of the education directorate, and Huw Morris, who is group director, skills, higher education and lifelong learning. Can I welcome you all and thank you for attending? Minister, I understand you'd like to make a short opening statement.
Kirsty Williams AM: Thank you very much, Lynne. And indeed, if I could just begin by, once again, putting on the record my gratitude to everyone who is helping us get through this pandemic. There are a vast number of people who are keeping our school hubs open, looking after vulnerable children, and the children of key workers. Because of them, and their efforts, those key workers are able to carry on their critical roles in responding to COVID-19. I am extremely proud of the way that members of the school community have gone above and beyond. They have kept their schools open out of hours, over the weekends, on bank holidays, and Easter. And it is really heartening and humbling to see the way that they have responded to this crisis. And there are teachers, teaching assistants, and many others, who are helping our children and their parents to keep learning at home. I know that home schooling isn't easy, so I want to say also thank you to parents and carers for their efforts at this time. By keeping their children at home, they are helping us to keep people safe, and reducing pressure on our education system, and on our NHS. Be in no doubt, we are facing many challenges because of this pandemic. My primary concern is, and always will be, the health and well-being of our children, of our young people, and of all the staff in our education settings. And I am very grateful to everyone who is supporting us in these endeavours. Thank you very much--diolch yn fawr. And I'm now happy to answer questions that members of the committee may have this afternoon.
Lynne Neagle AM: Thank you very much, Minister. I'm sure that the committee echoes the heartfelt thanks you have just given then. The first questions we've got this afternoon are from Hefin David.
Hefin David AM: Good afternoon, Minister. With regard to your five principles, which you've set out today, regarding when schools will reopen, they're very clear that they require a judgment from you. So could you outline when you think that schools might reopen?
Kirsty Williams AM: Thank you, Hefin. I am very clear that schools will move to a new phase--because, already, schools are open in many settings; we will move to a new phase when it is safe to do so and when I have advice from the chief medical officer and the chief scientific officer that it is safe to do so. I have made very clear in my statement that that is not imminent. I know that in some cases there has been speculation that a return to normal could be with us quite shortly. I'm clear that a return to normal is not imminent, and therefore I'm not in a position to give a date as to when we will see more schools opening up to more children.
Hefin David AM: Have you been given any indication at all by the chief medical officer as to when, in the longer term, it might be?
Kirsty Williams AM: No, I have not been given a date. What I have done today is publish the principles that will aid me in, as you said, me making a decision. So, clearly, we will be relying on the advice of our medical and scientific advisers, but the principles are very clear. Firstly, we will need to consider any decision to have more children returning to school in the context of the safety and the physical and the emotional well-being of children and young people and the staff. Obviously, I can't make a decision regarding education in isolation. It will have to be taken in the context of the wider Welsh Government response to dealing with this pandemic. Thirdly, it is absolutely crucial in making any decisions that we have clearly communicated that to parents and to staff, on the information that we have used to reach any decisions, to build confidence for parents and professionals, but also to give them time to plan. It will be impossible to move quickly to new ways of working. And we also have to look at--and it's been paraphrased quite a lot today--if we are looking at certain groups of children accessing more education within a school setting, which groups they should be. And, finally, how do we operationalise that? How do we make those settings as safe as they possibly can be, and how do we tackle some of the difficult challenges of everything from ensuring that we have adequate numbers of workforce available, to the very real questions about how you would do social distancing in the context of education, school transport issues, how you would avoid people gathering at the school gate, for instance? So, there are very practical issues that would need to be considered and thought through very, very carefully before we could return, before what we could see is a move from where we are now to the next phase of education, and new approaches to what schooling may look like. But, again, I must be absolutely clear to you, members of the committee, and to people watching: it is not feasible, in this sense, that we would move from where we are now to what all of us would regard as normal education and what the operation of schools looked like before the start of this pandemic.
Hefin David AM: So, what is clear from what you've said is that it's going to be phased return. I would assume that would be the most vulnerable--perhaps additional learning needs pupils would return first. Just reading some of the things that you've said today, can you answer that question? And can I also ask: you said that guiding principle No. 3 will be having the confidence of parents, staff and students, based on evidence and information, so they can plan ahead. What will that evidence and information be, and how will you know that you've got the confidence of parents to return?
Kirsty Williams AM: Well, as I said, primarily, we will need to take a lead from our scientific and medical advisers. I want to also say that we are obviously working on a four-nation basis and keeping in very close contact with my counterparts in Northern Ireland, Scotland and England. But we're also looking beyond the United Kingdom to approaches to education in the face of this pandemic. Members are aware that we as a nation are a member of the Atlantic Rim Collaboratory. So, recently I was able to talk to educationalists and Ministers in Iceland, other parts of Europe, North America, South America and Australia. So, we're also looking at best international evidence in this regard. And, clearly, we will need to be very clear, as today is an attempt to be very clear with parents and our teaching professionals, and the unions that represent them, about the basis of that evidence.
Hefin David AM: And could I just ask, with regard to the principles, do they then apply to further education and universities?
Kirsty Williams AM: Well, of course, when we are discussing these challenges, we are doing that with our colleagues in both the school sector but also our colleagues in the FE sector, and we're in close contact with colleagues in higher education to share thinking on these matters.
Hefin David AM: But these principles don't apply in those circumstances; these are principles for schools only.
Kirsty Williams AM: These principles are applying to both, and our work in this area is applying to both schools and FE colleges. Clearly, universities, as independent institutions, we wouldn't be able to dictate to. But I want to be absolutely clear: we are working with representatives of the HE sector to include them in this work. And I have received, not assurances, but from discussions that I've had with Universities Wales and vice-chancellors, they are very keen to be kept apprised of these approaches, because they may well wish to implement something similar within their own institutions.
Lynne Neagle AM: Okay. I've got a couple of supplementaries now; firstly, from Suzy Davies, and then I'm going to go to Sian Gwenllian. Suzy. No, we can't hear Suzy. Suzy? No. I'll go to Sian, then, and then I'll come back to Suzy. Sian.
Hefin David AM: Chair, I don't think my microphone is muted.
Sian Gwenllian AM: Okay. I'll move on to my question to Kirsty Williams. Now, it is clear that any decisions that need to be taken on reopening schools would have to be made in the context of all of the other issues that the Welsh Government has to take into account. And it is entirely clear that the approach of Government towards testing hasn't been sufficiently developed for us to even start to think about removing restrictions. So, wouldn't it be dangerous, if truth be told, to start to discuss reopening schools when we haven't had the necessary testing in place for the majority of the population? And doesn't it convey a mixed message that we're starting to relax some of these restrictions when, in reality, the restrictions are still in place and still need to be in place robustly?
Kirsty Williams AM: First of all, thank you very much, Sian, for that important question. Can I be absolutely clear, and I thought I had been pretty clear in answering Hefin David, that we are not relaxing any of the restrictions with regard to education? As I said to Hefin, it is not imminent that we would see a further phase in the next stage of education here in Wales. What I have done today is to provide clarity on the nature of the principles that I would use when coming to any discussion. It is the responsibility of me, as the Minister, and indeed of the wider Government, to begin to think about planning for the future. But I have been absolutely clear: we are not moving to an imminent change in how education is operating at the moment. And I'm also very, very clear that should we be given the opportunity to see more children in our schools, I will only do that when it is safe for me to do so, when I've been advised by the CMO that I am able to do that, and we have given sufficient time and planning to the sector to respond. It is not going to be easy, and we will need to give them, as a sector, time to be able to address. But if I have not been clear enough, let me say it again: we are not relaxing any issues around schools at present, nor is that imminent.
Lynne Neagle AM: Thank you. Suzy, I think we can try going to you again now.
Suzy Davies AM: Thank you. Minister, in your consideration of introducing a phased return to school, in due course, have you taken into consideration how things like school absences are going to be managed? Because, regardless of the amount of good work you do on messaging, there will still be some families that don't realise that going back to school is for their particular family. Will there be a relaxation of, effectively, what we would call truancy rules? Or is that something that schools will be getting guidance on much up-front?
Kirsty Williams AM: Thank you, Suzy. As I said in my statement earlier today, returning to school will not be a return to normal, and in recognition of this, I've already made it clear that I will seek, in all opportunities, to reduce the burdens on school. That includes various data collection, the suspension of performance measures and removing the requirement to undertake literacy and numeracy testing, and, clearly, school attendance will want to be an important factor of that.
Lynne Neagle AM: Okay. Thank you. I'm keen to go on now to talk about the current situation as being faced by our children and young people in schools with some questions from Sian Gwenllian. Sian.
Sian Gwenllian AM: Since yesterday, the Welsh Government has started publishing data on the number of schools that are open, the number of children attending those schools, and the number of staff involved, and they have been making this information available as per capita of the population. On average, I think it's 1 per cent of the children of Wales that actually attend these locations, and some 5 per cent of the staff. So, can you analyse those figures a little further? Can you tell us how many children, according to this data, are children of key workers, and how many are vulnerable children?
Kirsty Williams AM: Thank you very much, Sian. As you quite rightly say, on average, we have 518 school hubs open each day, with up to 4,200 children attending. We have seen an increase in the number of attendances since the start of what would have been the traditional summer term. We have approximately 5. 6 per cent of the teaching population working in those hubs, and at present, 85 per cent of the children who are attending are the children of key workers, the remainder being vulnerable children. So, we are now averaging 600 vulnerable children per day. These are small numbers, but we have seen an increase in those numbers since the start of what would have been the traditional summer term.
Sian Gwenllian AM: Okay. I'm sure we'll return to that point a little later on. How much confidence do you therefore have that the arrangements are effective in terms of the safety of staff and children at these locations?
Kirsty Williams AM: Thank you once again for that. The smooth operation of the hubs, with regard to health and safety, is, of course, of paramount importance. What we have seen since schools closed for traditional statutory purposes and moving to their repurposed function--we have seen a change of pattern over time. So, following my announcement on, I believe, 18 March, the week after, we saw a large number of settings open and operating. As local authorities have been able to understand the demand for those places--from critical workers and vulnerable children--we have seen more local authorities move to a hub model, and we have been able to publish guidance to local authorities on how issues around safe working in those hubs should be followed, and we've been able to give guidance in that regard. Local authorities are asked by us to report any incidents where they are concerned about operation issues on the ground.
Sian Gwenllian AM: As I mentioned earlier, testing is crucially important in dealing with this crisis. So, how many school staff have been tested for COVID because they may have experienced symptoms and so on? And how many of those have tested positive?
Kirsty Williams AM: My understanding from Public Health Wales is that 15 teachers have been tested for COVID-19, and I believe two of those results have come back as positive. Can I make it absolutely clear, the week before last, Welsh Government issued new guidance around who should be tested? I want to make it absolutely clear to those professionals working in our hubs, if they or a member of their family are exhibiting any of the symptoms, however mild, of COVID-19, they can and they should be tested.
Sian Gwenllian AM: Okay. And the final question from me on this: how important is testing going to be in this next phase, as you start to think about relaxing restrictions?
Kirsty Williams AM: Obviously, the ability to be able to test, to trace and to quarantine will be critical to the next phase and will be a very, very important and significant building block in all aspects of the Government's work to respond to this pandemic.
Lynne Neagle AM: Okay. Thank you, Minister, and thank you, Sian. We've got some questions now on the impact on particular groups of children, from Dawn Bowden.
Dawn Bowden AM: Thank you, Chair. Just following on from your answer to Sian Gwenllian earlier about the number of vulnerable children in school, what's being done specifically to facilitate more of those children coming into a school setting or hub at the moment? I'm thinking about the 600 you've talked about, and I know, in one of my local authority areas of Merthyr, which is a very small authority, we're talking about the number of children identified as vulnerable running into thousands, not hundreds, and that's just in one authority. So, this is a particularly difficult issue to address, I appreciate, but how are we going to get more of these children into the hubs?
Kirsty Williams AM: Okay, Dawn. The first thing to say is that the issue of vulnerable children attending settings is one that is a challenge to not just Wales, but also to my colleagues in Northern Ireland, Scotland and England. I'm pleased to say that we are working across Government departments--myself, obviously, and colleagues in education--with colleagues in social services to have a cross-Government approach to these issues. I think the first thing to say is that these are complex messages, because the overriding public health message from our Government has been to stay at home and children should be kept at home as much as possible, and to make sure that our hubs run smoothly, safely and effectively, we do need to limit the number of children who are attending those hubs. So, firstly, the fact that numbers are small is in some ways a success of our public health messages, because parents have been heeding those messages, but, of course, all of us will have concerns for some children who remain at home. So, I'm pleased to say that we have seen a doubling in the last week of the number of children. So, although numbers are small, they have doubled over the course of the last week. We're working with local authorities and they have assured us that children and young people with a social worker have been risk assessed on a multi-agency basis and are receiving support in a number of ways, and that includes having conversations about some of those children attending the hubs. They're also looking to support in other ways. Of course, some of our children who would be classed as vulnerable--and our definition of'vulnerable'is one that is shared between the systems in England and Wales--could be children with a statement of special educational needs. For some of those children who, perhaps, have very intense health needs, actually, staying at home is the appropriate thing for that child and that family to do, and we're looking to support families, and local authorities and local education systems are looking to support families, in a number of ways. We also know that just because you don't have a social worker or a statement of special educational needs does not mean that a child may not be vulnerable, and schools are very aware of the needs of those children and have been carrying out regular telephone check-ins where they can--if the age of the child is appropriate--just to keep in touch with those families and those individual children. But we will continue to work across Government to encourage, where it is appropriate, children to attend settings, and, if it is not appropriate for children to be in a setting, that there is contact with those children and young people to ensure that they remain, and their families remain, supported.
Dawn Bowden AM: Thank you, Minister. It's encouraging to hear you talk about the ongoing safeguarding of children that are at home and I assume, within that, appropriate referral mechanisms are still in place if teachers or anybody has any particular concern about a child. Similarly, with special educational needs, whereas some of those children benefit clearly from a one-to-one provision in a school, and they may not respond as well to remote working, or remote contact, with an SEN advisor, are you considering in any way any relaxation of the lockdown rule in particular for those children in terms of them being able to access the support that they need for their particular educational needs?
Kirsty Williams AM: Well, first of all, Dawn, you're absolutely right: my expectation is that schools should remain in contact with children and continue to identify vulnerable children, and schools should continue to refer children to children's services if they have any concerns, and that would also, of course, be the case for youth workers who may be keeping in contact with children. So, there is a professional expectation on all those that are working with our children and young people that, despite the circumstances they find themselves in, they should continue to report and refer cases if they see anything or hear or are told anything that makes them concerned about a child's welfare and safety. With regard to children with additional learning needs, I am aware that that can present a number of challenges to families and children, and perhaps Steve Davies could give some further details. We have been keen to work with local authorities to ensure specialist provision, where that is appropriate--so, if I could give you an example of my own local authority in Powys, they have two specialist centres available for children with more profound additional learning needs, and those centres are available--recognising, however, that, even with the provision of specialist hubs, it can be a challenge for some children with additional learning needs to find themselves outside of a routine. Hubs are often staffed on a rota basis and therefore children could be faced with staff that they are unfamiliar with. So, even when local authorities--and the vast, vast majority of them do--have specialist services in place, sometimes that might not be the best thing for a child's health and well-being. But perhaps Steve can give us further details of the conversations that have been taking place with directors of education to ensure that children with additional learning needs have access to the hubs and specialist support. Steve.
Steve Davies: Yes, myself and colleague Albert Heaney--colleague-director--have been in regular touch with directors of education and directors of social services to make sure that these children and young people's needs are catered for. We are very aware of all of the special schools--profound and multiple learning difficulties, EBD schools and pupil referral units--that have been kept open in their own way, but also, in some cases, as hubs, to deliver those services for those children's needs, and we're pleased that the directors and the local authorities have responded so constructively. So, we have the details of every school that's open, the pupils who are attending, and we are clear that the risk assessments that the Minister referred to for children with special needs, as well as wider vulnerable groups--they are having risk assessments to make sure that, where there is a need identified for a pupil that is not currently attending a hub, then the local authority can be working with that child and with the parents.
Lynne Neagle AM: Thank you, Steve. Dawn.
Dawn Bowden AM: Thank you. Just two more questions. One is around emotional and mental health difficulties being experienced by children and young people at the moment. Now, there was a very welcome announcement of PS1. 25 million pounds for school counselling. How is that, in practical terms, being applied if those children are not actually in school?
Kirsty Williams AM: You're right, Dawn: we have to consider how we can support children not only in their learning during this time, but also to recognise the very real impact that the pandemic will have on all of our mental health and well-being--recognising, of course, it is absolutely natural for all of us, including children and young people, to have fears and anxieties at this time. That's a natural reaction to the situation that we find ourselves in. But, of course, there are issues around those children that would have currently been receiving school counselling, and also being able to be in a position to respond to a potential growth in the number of children that are receiving support. So, the additional money will be made available to local authorities to be able to increase and ramp up services to support children and families. In the immediacy, of course, that will have to be done in different ways than perhaps we've traditionally delivered services in the past, because of social distancing and lockdown rules, but we want to get some of these systems in place now, rather than waiting for everything to go back to normal. We need to be able to plan to offer services in the here and now, but also be able to plan for what potentially could be an increase in the demand of those services. So, we've been in close touch with local authorities, asking them what they believe that they will need and how they can use additional financial resources, and we've been very pleased to be able to secure that for them.
Dawn Bowden AM: So, that would include things like telephone and video support as well, I guess, then.
Kirsty Williams AM: Yes, absolutely. So, that would include remote counselling as in a fashion that we're doing now, but also, as and when some of the restrictions are perhaps removed, looking at an enhanced family therapy, or a therapy approach. So, when we talk about counselling, I think it's important to recognise that there will be some flexibility around this money and it does not necessarily mean that local authorities have to use it on a one-to-one basis. That might not be appropriate for some children, especially our younger children and their families, and they can use that money to provide counselling or therapy--in the widest possible terms--that is the best method to support individual children and their families. But, clearly, we're having to do that in the confines of lockdown and social distancing at the moment. Some of that money can also be used to support the professional learning and the professional development of counsellors, because, of course, they may be being asked to work in a different way and we need to make sure that they have the appropriate skills and abilities to do that.
Dawn Bowden AM: Thank you. Thank you, Minister.
Lynne Neagle AM: Dawn, before you ask your final question, I've got a couple of supplementaries--firstly from Suzy, and then from Hefin.
Suzy Davies AM: Oh, thank you. My question goes back to the comment you made earlier, Minister, about the number of children doubling--sorry, vulnerable children doubling--after the Easter break, if we can call it that. So, what I'm after is a sense of churn in these establishments. So, was that figure a recovery of a number of children that had been there before the Easter break, and are the people who are there still the same people as were there right at the beginning of the crisis and the lockdown?
Kirsty Williams AM: Suzy, what I believe that we're seeing in our schools is new pupils coming into school. So, there has been, I know, a real effort on behalf of educationalists and social services staff to really reach out to families and to make sure that they're aware of the support that is available out there for them and their children, and to be able to give them the confidence that there are--that the hubs are available for them. So, we have seen an increase in children. Those numbers are still small and, I believe, potentially, there is an opportunity to build on that and to have further conversations with families about the support that is available for vulnerable children, whether that--. That vulnerability, of course, can cover a whole range of issues. As I said when we last met, this is a constantly evolving situation. The initial response--local authorities and schools worked incredibly fast and incredibly quickly to set up these hubs. We've seen an evolution in the weeks since that time and I am sure that we will continue to see some evolution in approaches.
Lynne Neagle AM: Okay, thank you. Hefin, you had a supplementary--briefly, please.
Hefin David AM: Yes, very quickly. I've been listening to the answers with regard to vulnerable children, following on from that answer. I'm at home with a vulnerable child--a child who has got additional learning needs. She's got autism; she's four. I imagine there are many, many parents in exactly the same position--I've heard from them. I haven't heard anything from the school or from the local authority. Should I have heard something or should I be proactive in pursuing it?
Kirsty Williams AM: I don't want to comment on personal cases--
Hefin David AM: But there are many others in this position.
Kirsty Williams AM: --but what I would say is that if parents have concerns and want to have a conversation about what support is available to them and their children, they should contact their local education authority to have a conversation as to what support is available.
Lynne Neagle AM: Okay, thank you. Dawn, final question, please.
Dawn Bowden AM: Yes, my last question is really about the potential for the attainment gap between disadvantaged pupils and their more affluent peers. Is that a concern for you? I'm thinking particularly in relation to those less affluent families in having access to technology and so on. What kind of concerns do you have about that and what are we looking to do to try to ensure that that doesn't actually play out?
Kirsty Williams AM: Thank you, Dawn. All of the statistics would tell us that learning loss and the gap, potentially, will affect those more vulnerable children the most. Clearly, we will want to consider that as we think about what the new normal for education may look like, or as we develop into future phases. Depending on where that child is in their educational journey, of course, the needs and the potential for loss are slightly different. So, for instance, when we're thinking about very young children, we could be thinking about a lack of social interaction and the development of oracy skills. Of course, that, potentially, then will have a knock-on to their ability to learn to read and then to write, for instance. For other children who are, perhaps, older and heading towards formal examinations, the challenge when they return to school will be a slightly different one. I'm not sure, Chair, whether you want me to give some further details about our continuity-of-learning plan and how we are looking to address digital disadvantage now, or whether there are questions later.
Lynne Neagle AM: Well, I've got a question on that coming up, so, if it's okay, Dawn, we'll go on to that now. Before we do that, I was just going to ask how the Welsh Government is paying due regard to the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child and, obviously, the right children and young people have to an education. I was going to ask you about the risk of inequality due to varying access to digital resources, which are so important in ensuring continuity of learning.
Kirsty Williams AM: You're absolutely correct, Chair. Officials are very aware of our responsibilities towards children's rights in this regard and we are doing whatever we can to ensure that children have an equal opportunity and have equal access to learning at this time. We are fortunate in the regard that, because of previous decisions and investments, we have a strong base on which to build because we have our Hwb digital learning platform and because we have invested heavily in the national purchasing of Microsoft Office and Google for Education tools, which are available to all families. We have become the first, I think--we're certainly the first in the UK, and I'm not sure whether we're the first across the world, but I think we probably are--to deploy, for instance, Adobe Spark nationally. But, obviously, access to hardware and connectivity is crucial at this time. Officials are working with local authorities to ensure that all children have access to both the hardware and the connectivity they need to be able to participate in digital learning at this particular time.
Lynne Neagle AM: Okay, thank you. Just a final question from me: how exactly are we communicating to parents what the expectations are of them in terms of delivering this education at home now? Are there, for example, guidelines on recommended hours of home learning per day of the week or volume of work to be completed? How are we ensuring that parents know how best to lead their children through this at the moment?
Kirsty Williams AM: Firstly, can I recognise what a challenge this is? We've just heard from Hefin who is carrying on his day job as the Assembly Member, but is obviously trying to do that as well as care for and provide learning for his children, and I know, Chair, that you're doing the same, and I'm certainly trying to do the same, and it's a real challenge, it's not easy. As part of our'Stay Safe. Stay Learning'policy statement, advice is available to parents and carers on the Hwb platform as to what they best can do to support their children. I think the really important message that I've been trying to give to parents is not to be too hard on ourselves. I know that everybody is doing the best that they can in really challenging circumstances. And if they have concerns, they should be in contact with their child's school, but we do have specific advice and guidance to parents on the Hwb platform.
Lynne Neagle AM: Thank you. We're going to move on now to some questions on examinations from Janet Finch-Saunders. Janet, we can't hear you. I tell you what, we'll--. Janet, do you want to try again? No. Okay, we'll go on then to questions on higher education and post 16, and we'll come back to examinations, if that's okay. Suzy.
Suzy Davies AM: Yes, thank you, Chair. Before we leave continuity of learning, do you mind if I just ask this one question?
Lynne Neagle AM: No, that's fine. Yes, go on.
Suzy Davies AM: Your comment, Minister, on working with local authorities to make sure that individuals have hardware: can you just give us a bit of detail on what working with local authorities actually means? In the process of that, is there any data gathering going on for those pupils who are being educated at home and the levels at which they're engaging? You know, are they sticking with it, or how many are dropping out? Because I think the two of those perhaps go together.
Kirsty Williams AM: Yes, absolutely. So, I'm hoping to make an announcement tomorrow, if not later on this week, about some specific details around support for hardware and connectivity. We're working closely with local authorities to understand just that: to understand from the schools the number of schools that--and a number of them have already done this--have been lending Chromebooks, iPads and laptops to children, and also identifying children who are not perhaps engaging in the activities that have been made available. And we'll be doing two things to support local authorities. The first is to use the stock of equipment that they already have to be able to provide hardware to students. So, we have purchased on a national basis software that, when applied to an old piece of kit, essentially turns it into an out-of-the-box Chromebook. Because, as you can imagine, just like other things during a pandemic, there has been a rush to buy new stuff on the market and then there is a scramble and nobody can get what they need. So, we're utilisng kit that is already available in schools and local authorities, and we will look to backfill that to schools at a later point out of our EdTech investment programme. The other issue is, once a child has a Chromebook or a laptop or a device, issues around connectivity. So, we're also looking to purchase on a national level and distribute Mi-Fi connectivity, so students will be able to have access to Wi-Fi where they don't have that already. That's why we need to work closely with local authorities and schools to identify the level of that need and to make sure the stuff gets to the right children. One of the ways in which we are able to do that is to look at engagement in education. So, if a child hasn't been engaging, is that because they just don't want to and they're voting with their feet--but clearly teachers need to have a conversation about that--or is that because the child simply does not have the ability to do that, and therefore we need to get that stuff out to those children? So, rather than just simply leaving it to local authorities to scramble around in a very crowded market to get the stuff that they will need, we're trying to do that on a national basis and deploy that to local authorities. So, our officials have been having conversations with each of our local authorities to ascertain what's already happened, and there is very good practice out there--schools have been proactive--but where there are gaps, what can we do as a national Government to be able to assist them to do that? We are repurposing some of the resources that we had previously identified for our EdTech investment, using those resources to fill this particular gap.
Suzy Davies AM: Thank you.
Lynne Neagle AM: Okay. Thank you. We're going to go back to Janet now. I believe we've got sound again, so Janet can ask her questions on examinations. Janet.
Janet Finch-Saunders AM: Thank you. I thought it was something at this end; I'm glad to hear it wasn't. When will vocational learners know what is happening with their assessments, and how will those who have no choice but to wait for a vocational assessment be supported?
Kirsty Williams AM: Okay. That's a very good question, Janet, because I know that there has been some concern and anxiety around vocational qualification students and how quickly we've been able to provide certainty for them. You'll be aware that Qualifications Wales have been able, in the last week, to be able to give that greater clarity. So, they have announced that learners due to complete their Essential Skills Wales qualifications will receive results. They have also published their approach to how health and social care qualifications will be managed, because, of course, those are part of the first set of reformed quals that we have done on a Wales basis. You are right, there are a group of students who fall into the category where there are technical qualifications that require a certificate of competency to be industry ready--I hope I've explained that correctly--and, therefore, we are working to understand how we can accommodate those students in these particular circumstances. But, at this stage, there may be some delay for that element of their qualification being delayed to a further date.
Janet Finch-Saunders AM: Thank you.
Lynne Neagle AM: Janet.
Janet Finch-Saunders AM: Yes. What are your expectations for how A-level and GCSE qualifications will be awarded this summer, following the ministerial direction that you have issued to Qualifications Wales? For example, how is an appropriate balance being taken between recognising the progress of pupils in their coursework, mock examinations, and other work to date, and also, the potential of pupils who might have performed particularly well in their examinations this summer?
Kirsty Williams AM: Well, Janet, I understand--and today is a day where some students would have been undertaking practical examinations--I understand how devastating it has been to both students and teachers alike for the decision I had to take to cancel this summer's exam series. But I'm absolutely clear that was the only decision that could have been reached. Qualifications Wales has made it very clear--and for people who would like more information, I would urge them to look at Qualifications Wales's website--how they will go about giving, allocating, and awarding a grade to our A-level and GCSE students. Firstly, teachers will be asked to submit a grade they believe that student would have obtained, should they have taken an exam. And, of course, teachers will have a range of data and their own professional judgment that they will use in awarding that grade. Teachers will also be asked to rank students in order. Once that information has been submitted to Qualifications Wales, there will be a process by which that data will be moderated; moderated from centre to centre and across the nation, thus giving us the chance to award a student a fair grade whilst being, and remaining, true to ensuring that we have a robust qualifications system, and allowing those students who find themselves at a critical stage of their education, where they are looking to move on to the next stages--that they will have the grades that will allow them to make decisions about their future.
Janet Finch-Saunders AM: Okay, thank you.
Lynne Neagle AM: Thank you, Janet. We're going to go on now, then, to the questions on higher and further education from Suzy Davies. Suzy.
Suzy Davies AM: Thank you, Chair. I suppose my first question just goes back to the 16-year-olds at the moment and those who are looking forward to either going to college, the older ones going to university, there'll be apprenticeships, all kinds of future pathways for post 16. What's happening at school level, or even at college level, to get those students ready for the next steps, because, obviously, they're not in their usual environments and getting their usual programme of teaching?
Kirsty Williams AM: No, that's quite right, Suzy, and I should have said in answer to Janet's question, as well--I'm sure people already know, but just to get the point across--that A-level results day and GCSE day will run as normal across not just Wales, but England, Wales and Northern Ireland, which is really important. You're right, Suzy--for those people that are coming to the end of one part of their education this is a particularly challenging time. You'll be aware that, last week, on Hwb, we were able to launch a programme for year 13 students to help them get ready for university. I'm very grateful to the HE sector in Wales, who've worked really hard with us on that. So, for instance, if you were a year 13 student or even a year 12 student that was thinking about or interested in areas around social policy, you could have tuned into a social policy lecturer at Swansea University. If you go to the Hwb website, you will be able to see that there are subject listings, everything from animal science through to law, politics, history and science, with links through to higher education and further education courses that students can avail themselves of. There's also a section on preparation for essential study skills, whether that is report writing or academic writing. So, there is a range of activities and courses available for year 13, so that children--'children'; they're all children to me--young people can get themselves--. They don't have to stop learning, and they can get themselves ready for the next stage of their education. Again, for those children, perhaps, who are coming to the end of their GCSEs, there is a range of information, either within their own schools or within their local colleges about things that can keep them learning. So, for instance, I'm aware of one school where you can go onto the website and there are recommendations of, for instance, what you could be reading over the summer if you're interested in doing this particular A-level in September. I know that there are also moves in schools and in colleges to be able to make sure that those children don't miss out on really important careers advice at this time, as well, and information, so they can make informed decisions. I know that people are working hard to link up children to advice services that are available so that they can make those really important future decisions with the advice of either a teacher or other professional so that they've got those options. So, there is material out there and it's growing all the time. This week, we were able to launch our virtual Seren network. You'll be aware that, for the last couple of years, we've been able to send Welsh children to the Yale global summer school. Clearly, that can't happen this year. That's devastating for those year 12s who had worked so hard and had won a place on that programme. They will now be able to attend the Yale global scholars programme virtually and remotely, because Yale have moved that programme online. So, we're developing materials and resources all of the time.
Suzy Davies AM: Thank you for that answer. Before I move on to my next question, can you give me some sort of sense of how that Hwb domain is being populated? Where is all this information being sourced from? Presumably, they'll be working with partners, but what does that look like?
Kirsty Williams AM: Oh, my goodness. Yes, absolutely--
Suzy Davies AM: [Inaudible. ]
Kirsty Williams AM: Yes, we're working very hard. So, everything from our work with the BBC, for instance, and BBC Bitesize through to our FE colleges and our HE institutions, as well as other organisations in the third sector who are looking to provide those opportunities. Can I just say that, last week, we were looking at, every day, in the region of well over 150,000 logins a day into Hwb?
Suzy Davies AM: Well, that's great. So there's proactive populating of Hwb. That's what I was after. That's great. Just going back to some of Janet's questions and the assessed grades, I want to talk to you about the unconditional offers and where we are with that at the moment for entry to universities, because there's going to be a scramble now of the available students for further education, but primarily higher education institutions, across the UK. Is the moratorium on unconditional offers still standing? Are there conversations going on to extend that moratorium? Otherwise, this scramble is going to potentially negatively affect our universities quite considerably.
Kirsty Williams AM: Yes, you'll be aware that a moratorium does exist. It exists in this current context to 1 May. We continue to keep in close touch with colleagues in Northern Ireland, Scotland and in the Westminster Government around these issues. Officials are also in touch with UCAS, and in the last couple of days I've had at least three meetings with representatives of the Welsh higher education sector to discuss these matters.
Suzy Davies AM: I just want to ask you now about students and their maintenance loan grants. I think they're getting, around now, the money going into their bank account that they would normally have expected at this time of year. That's right, yes?
Kirsty Williams AM: That's correct, yes.
Suzy Davies AM: What's happening to those students who would normally be living in digs somewhere but are now living at home? Are they likely to be asked to reimburse part of the cost, because obviously it's not as expensive to live at home as away, and what's likely to be happening with the maintenance loans over the summer holiday period, potentially? Because we've had a period now where students can't top up their maintenance loans by going out and working on weekends or working in the evenings, or whatever, so their income has been impacted. Just in the round, what kind of conversations are happening around that? Again, it's probably a four-nation approach, I would imagine.
Kirsty Williams AM: Thank you, Suzy. You are correct to say that our student support regime does allow for a lower payment to be made to those students that stay at home during their studies, but I want to reassure students that there will be no change to their student support payments just because they have left their universities and have decided to go home. There should be no change. Also, we are continuing, it should be important to say, to pay education maintenance allowance at this time for our FE students that are eligible for that, even though, obviously, for EMA there is an attendance requirement, but clearly that is not appropriate to enforce at the moment. You are correct--this is a worrying time for many students in higher education, especially for those who are looking to graduate at this time and are going out into an economy that has been tremendously badly hit by the pandemic. At this time, we continue to have conversations with NUS Wales about what can be done within a Welsh context, but, as you quite rightly say, also within a UK context, to support students who may have been affected. We are continuing--on our webpage we have a frequently asked questions section that advises students in the first instance, especially when it comes, for instance, to the cost of accommodation--to have those discussions, and I'm very grateful that, in some cases, some of our institutions have been able to waive or partially waive accommodation fees where students have vacated their accommodation and have returned to their usual home address. But we will continue to have dialogue with NUS Wales and with our counterparts across the country to look to see what more we can do to support students at this time.
Suzy Davies AM: Thank you for that answer, and, yes, I was pleased to see that announcement through the NUS as well, so well done to those accommodation providers who have a heart. I think we'll all have seen the Universities UK document that explains some of the difficulties that they're going to be running into if this proceeds much further. My understanding is that the main emphasis at the moment is to try and get all the universities across the UK through this initial period of difficulty by releasing as much money as possible. I can see that your figure to the Higher Education Funding Council for Wales was a little bit down on last year's letter--not that there's been a remit letter yet, but an indication. Are you releasing that money earlier so that they can use it more swiftly, or does that not matter?
Lynne Neagle AM: Before you come in, Minister, that is going to have to be the last question, just to make you aware of that, because we are coming up to the end of our time.
Suzy Davies AM: Okay. That's fine.
Kirsty Williams AM: Of course, Suzy, we are working closely with Universities Wales and have a lot of sympathy for the proposals that have come forward from Universities UK, which Wales's universities have been a part of forming. Stability in the first instance is really important to us, which is why we've been able to give an indication to HEFCW about resources that are available, and we've been very clear to HEFCW that we want to be as flexible as possible in how they use those resources to support institutions. That potentially would mean reprofiling the way in which money gets out to institutions, but clearly we will need to have an ongoing discussion about how we respond to the immediacy of the issues facing HE, how we can get stability for the next academic year, and how we then can support the sector through what is a really challenging time for them. We will do that in a Welsh context and we will continue to do that also in a UK context, because you will have seen the scale of some of the figures that have been talked about in terms of the impact on the HE sector at this time. Clearly, a four-nation approach to that will be crucial.
Suzy Davies AM: Thank you.
Lynne Neagle AM: Okay. Thank you. Well, we have come to the end of our time, and, as to anything that we didn't ask, we will have to write to the Minister. Can I just thank the Minister and her officials for your attendance today? We know how busy you are dealing with the pandemic and we very much welcome this opportunity to have this discussion with you. So, thank you, Minister and officials for your time. As usual, you will be sent a transcript to check for accuracy following the meeting. Diolch yn fawr.
Kirsty Williams AM: Diolch yn fawr, Chair.
Lynne Neagle AM: Item 3, then. Can I propose, in accordance with Standing Order 17. 42, that the committee resolves to meet in private for the remainder of the meeting? Are Members content? Okay. I see that Members are content, so we will now proceed to meet in private.","To get the students who planned to enter college for the next step, Kirsty Williams AM introduced that last week, on Hwb, they were able to launch a programme for year 13 students to help them get ready for university. On the Hwb website, students would be able to see the subject listings, everything from animal science through to law, politics, history and science, with links through to higher education and further education courses that students could avail themselves of. There was also a section on preparation for essential study skills, whether that was report writing or academic writing. Similar preparation like the help from career advice website was also accessible. Meanwhile, new materials and resources would be developed.",qmsum
"How would special schools fit into the new purpose arrangement?
Lynne Neagle AM: Good morning, everyone. Welcome to the Children, Young People and Education Committee this morning. I've received apologies for absence from Sian Gwenllian, and I'm very pleased to welcome Helen Mary Jones, who is substituting for Sian today. Can I ask whether Members want to declare any interests, please? Can I just, then, place on record that I have got a son who was about to do A-levels, so is affected by the exam decision? We'll move on, then, to our substantive item today, which is an evidence session with the Welsh Government around the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on education in Wales. I'm very pleased to welcome Kirsty Williams, Minister for Education; Steve Davies, who is director of the education directorate; Huw Morris, who is the group director, skills, higher education and lifelong learning; and Rob Orford, who is the chief scientific adviser for health. Thank you all for coming. We know that this is a really difficult and pressurised time for everyone, and we appreciate your attendance. Minister, I understand you wanted to make an opening statement today.
Kirsty Williams AM: Yes, if that's okay, Chair. As you know, it's not usually my practice to do that, but I think it is important today. COVID-19 coronavirus is one of the most significant issues that the Welsh Government and the people of Wales have dealt with in recent times. Dealing with the impacts of this pandemic is extremely challenging. Things are changing on an hourly basis, and we have to make decisions quickly to ensure public safety. But I would like to assure you that our aim, and my aim, and my main concern as the education Minister is to protect all staff and pupils in our schools and other educational settings. But we also have a duty to ensure continuing and continuity of education. Public health is clearly the priority here, but that does not change our belief that no child should miss out on any education, unless absolutely necessary. So, the decision to close all schools from tomorrow for statutory education provision was not taken lightly, but I believe it was necessary, given the advice and recommendations that we had received from a public health perspective and the situation that was developing on the ground. From next week, schools will have a new purpose. They will help support those most in need, including people involved in the immediate response to the coronavirus outbreak, and I'm working with my colleagues in the Cabinet, with Government officials and our partners in local government to develop and finalise these plans. The key areas that we're looking at are supporting and safeguarding the vulnerable and ensuring continuity of learning. This includes all of those who benefit from free school meals and children with additional learning needs. I can confirm that all maintained schools in Wales already have access to a range of digital tools that can support distance learning through the world-class Hwb digital learning platform, including virtual classrooms and video-conferencing facilities. A guide on what tools are available and how schools can use them has been developed and is being promoted widely. Yesterday, I announced that, whilst there are no easy choices, we have agreed that the best way forward is not to proceed with the summer exam series. Learners due to sit these exams will be awarded a fair grade to recognise their work, drawing on a range of information that is available, and I will announce further details shortly, but I felt it necessary to give early certainty to students and to staff. I would like to put on record my thanks to everyone working in education settings for the hard work that they have put in over the last few months in dealing with the virus and ensuring that pupils have been able to continue to learn. We need to continue to do this work together, as we face the continuing challenges posed by the coronavirus. Diolch yn fawr.
Lynne Neagle AM: Thank you very much, Minister, for that statement. We'll go to questions from Members now, and I've got some questions from Dawn Bowden.
Dawn Bowden AM: Thank you, Chair. Can I thank you, Kirsty, for your statement and the really difficult decisions that you've been having to make? You've already indicated in your statement this morning that these decisions are not taken lightly, and we understand that that is the case across Government. So, thank you for what you've been doing. You've outlined a little bit further there in your statement to us this morning about the new purpose. I take from what you're saying that you haven't really developed that yet in terms of exactly what that is going to look like. You've talked about the children of key workers, free school meals, additional learning needs. Is there anything else you can tell us about that at the moment and how you might staff the schools in those particular areas?
Kirsty Williams AM: Thank you, Dawn. So, you're absolutely right, our priority now is to operationalise, with colleagues in local government and schools, a practical response. And I have to say, we're working to timescales that I would have hoped to have avoided, but given the fact that we're having to make these decisions quite quickly, I hope that you will understand that perhaps where we start on Monday might change when we have more time and more opportunities to develop programmes going forward. Steve will be able to give you more details of the practical work that has already been going on, but our expectation will be that schools will be playing an important part in providing safe and secure places for children of those on the front-line response to dealing with the coronavirus to attend, and work is already under way with local authorities and individual schools on what that will look like for the emergency situation on Monday. Our other priority is indeed free school meals, and, again, where we eventually end up might be a different place to where we are on Monday. Again, we're responding to the emergency situation that there will be families that were expecting a free school meal on Monday, and, again, individual schools and local authorities are developing those plans at pace to be able to provide an emergency response as we work out a longer term plan to deal with the situation. The same thing also goes for additional learning needs, and attending to the needs of that particular group of learners. So, those conversations began a few days ago. I had the opportunity to meet with the First Minister and Andrew Morgan, the leader of the Welsh Local Government Association, yesterday to talk about what local government could do, and what they were already doing. Those plans in some places are already quite developed, and are now working at pace, but I hope you will understand that where we start on Monday is the emergency response, and that work will develop as we go forward. But, Steve, perhaps you could--? Because Steve was the one making all those phone calls and doing the practical operational stuff, rather than me. Steve.
Steve Davies: In short, the new purpose is to meet the needs of particular groups of children and young people. In some cases, some of the response to supporting free school meals, in the short term in particular, we may use the schools as part of that, and I'm certain that will happen in some cases. The second area is looking at how we support the children of key workers. Now, there is still work to be done on identifying exactly the categories of key workers, but I think it's really encouraging that in my discussions yesterday--I spoke with all 22 directors of education, and the examples we're picking up in their work with schools is they're already ahead of the curve in working with schools. So, schools have identified the number of children with health workers. It will grow, and we will need to look at that range. Then, the third area is vulnerable children. They're vulnerable sometimes in terms of education other than at school, vulnerable in terms of mental health, and for those children, as well as having an experience that we want to be planned, some have compared it to a snow day, particularly on Monday, when you're putting something together in the short term, but it will not be a formal curriculum that those children would normally go through. So, the range of activities--some will be focused on educational activities, some will be cultural, some will be sporting, and that plan will be developed on the basis of the age range of children, which in some cases may go from extremely young children up to those at the age of 16 in our all-through schools, but there will be a planned set of activities to cater for those children. What we are doing currently--I have staff back at Cathays Park who are in touch and working with directors of education to ensure that schools over the next two days will have been able to identify, at least at the earlier stage, in terms of health workers, the type and numbers of people. There are already schools who have informed us, and local authorities, of their plans for these activities to be starting next week, which is quite amazing, actually, given where we are. But we are expecting, and we're writing to schools today, that during the course of next week, headteachers to be in schools, and with their staff, taking into consideration the health guidance as to which staff should or should not be in, and in that period from next Monday through the two-week period, to Easter, we expect staff to be both planning for delivery post Easter, but also, as I said, building on and reflecting the good practice that's already in place for schools that have engaged in activities, and I'm sure a number of them will be inviting and enabling those children to come in on Monday. So, Monday will be a challenge for some, and not all will be delivering it, but we will be working so that we can get as much as possible delivered for those groups over the next two weeks, and particularly to have resilient programmes post Easter for the groups of children in those three categories that I said.
Dawn Bowden AM: Those that have been identified. Can I just clarify one thing? One of the identified vulnerable groups would clearly be children on the at-risk register. They would be included.
Steve Davies: Yes, definitely. Vulnerable children, yes.
Kirsty Williams AM: In our discussions, we have asked local government to be working with the social services departments and individual schools to identify those children who may be in that situation. We know that, for some children, being at school is part of their safeguarding arrangements, and obviously we will need to be able to respond to those needs.
Steve Davies: I wrote specifically yesterday to all directors of education to be assured that, for those children, the register is up to date and the plans are in place. I'm working with Albert Heaney my colleague, the director for social services, who is meeting with the 22 directors of social services today to look to ensure that we are joined up in ensuring none of these children fall through the gap.
Lynne Neagle AM: Okay. I've got a supplementary from Hefin, and then Suzy.
Hefin David AM: A very quick and simple question: how are you going to communicate this to parents? There's a bigger picture and it's changing all the time, as you said. The Welsh Government have a route to communication. The most helpful thing I've seen is that Public Health Wales have a single website with information regarding the wider issue of the virus. How will this then be cascaded to schools, because there's obviously a time lag? So, have you considered how this is going to be communicated directly to parents?
Kirsty Williams AM: We're using all of our platforms of communication to get these messages across. So, we're using the more informal methods of communication, but are relying on a systematic approach via individual directors and through to individual schools. Welsh Government already has a dedicated website page with all of the relevant information about coronavirus. We're looking, as quickly as we can, to have a frequently asked education questions page that we can update. Understandably, people are communicating to us on Twitter asking questions. It is impossible for the communications team here to be able to respond individually to every single person that is sending Facebook messages and sending tweets, so the best way we can do that is to collate the types of questions people are asking and then to be able to have a frequently updated question and answer page to try to respond to that. With regard to parents, for instance, we're aware of schools that have already sent a questionnaire out last night to parents saying,'Do you consider yourself to be a key worker? Do you work in the NHS? Please let us know by tomorrow so we can put arrangements in place for your children.'So, schools are already taking the initiative and having those conversations with parents about what their needs will be. And, as I said, Hefin, will it be perfect on Monday? No. It won't be perfect by Monday, because we're working to such constrained timescales. But we will continue to build that resilience. We also have to think about systems that look at what might the epidemic do and have systems of resilience that may work next week, given the situation we find ourselves in with public health advice at the moment. But that public health advice may change. Therefore, have we got a system that will be resilient in those circumstances? These are some of the challenges that we're having to grapple with. So, as I said, what happens on Monday might look very different to where we are if schools are still off in May. So, I hope people will understand that we are working in those kinds of scenarios.
Lynne Neagle AM: Suzy, you had a supplementary.
Suzy Davies AM: Yes, just on this question of vulnerable children, I'm just wondering how much discretion teachers are going to have in including individual children who may not be obviously under social services'care or on a risk register or whatever. Teachers know their pupils and, very sensitively, they could include people who may not be obviously in need.
Kirsty Williams AM: We would absolutely respect the professional judgment of individual headteachers to be able to have those conversations with their directors. As you said, quite rightly, they are the individuals who know their children best and know which children, perhaps, will need this extra support. We will put no constraints on those teachers trying to do that work.
Suzy Davies AM: Okay. The second part of my question is: there were going to be Easter holidays anyway, weren't there? What was going to happen about free-school-meal children during that period? Has that gone out of the window now, the normal holiday provision for children? Because that's not there normally, is it, except in separate--
Kirsty Williams AM: We do find ourselves in a strange situation. My understanding is what we're trying to work to is that we would have ongoing provision and not to make some strange,'You get this for two weeks, then you don't get it for two weeks, and then you're back in.'My understanding is, in England, that is what they're going to do. We're trying to create a system where it will be seamless and it will not necessarily matter that two of those weeks were formally holidays. It won't matter to those nurses and doctors who will need to be in work during those weeks. We're trying to create a system that will run uniformly. That's our policy goal at the moment.
Lynne Neagle AM: Helen Mary.
Helen Mary Jones AM: Just briefly, building on Suzy's question, one particular group of children and young people that I hope will be eligible to be included in the potentially vulnerable category is young carers. For some of them, they may not be able to come into school because the people they're caring for may have to be excluded because of their conditions. But I think that, for other young carers, coming to school is an absolute lifeline, because they're working at home. So, I don't know if it's appropriate for you to specifically mention those in discussions with local authorities, but it's a group of young people who, again, may not be vulnerable in other ways, but because of their caring responsibilities they may need school. And the other group--and this, I suppose, goes back to Suzy's point about teachers knowing their young people--is the children who may be living in situations where they're at risk of witnessing domestic abuse. Again, these may very well not be children who are in any formal contact with social services, but being at home may be really not a good place for them to be. So, again, I'd put in an appeal for that to be something that perhaps can be raised with schools. If a teacher is worried about what a child's circumstances are like at home, whether they can be, as you said, Kirsty, included as one of the--. They may not be formally identified, but if the teacher knows that they're at risk, or there is an instinct that they're at risk, they might be able to be included in children who are allowed to take advantage of this special provision you're making at this difficult time.
Kirsty Williams AM: We will certainly raise those issues. We have to do that in the context of what is deliverable, and we also have to do that in the context of the public health advice that we are receiving as well. One of the reasons why schools are closing is to help manage this disease. We know that the ability for school closures to make a contribution to that diminishes if we have significant children in school still. So, we will take these issues into consideration, but remembering this is part of an epidemic mitigation plan. Rob is the expert on that, not me.
Rob Orford: Yes, absolutely. This is a rapidly-evolving problem and the scale is something that we haven't seen in 100 years, and so we're having to evolve and iterate things as we go. Next week, I think, will look different to this week. So, it kind of is what it is. We've all got a role to play, and schools certainly have a significant role to play in breaking those chains of transmission. Areas that we're worried about are displacement activities. If we close the schools, then people collect at others'houses. We need to send a really clear message that you're all part of the solution, and the things that you do by distancing yourselves from your friends and your family are really important for us to get on top of this outbreak. The more that we can do that, the easier it will be when we go forward.
Helen Mary Jones AM: I'm sure that that's true, but I'm sure that we wouldn't be wanting a child who's in a very pressured environment with perhaps a very difficult relationship between mum and dad--. It may be very important for those children to be out of that for some of the time. Hopefully, we're talking about relatively small numbers, but I just--.
Kirsty Williams AM: We will look at vulnerability in a holistic way.
Lynne Neagle AM: Janet, you had a supplementary.
Janet Finch-Saunders AM: Thank you, Chair, and good morning, Minister, and your team. Can I just put on record my thanks for all that you're having to endure at this moment? I think it's fair to say you have the support of Assembly Members and, indeed, our communities. Now, the question I have: if Cylch Meithrin have to close, where will they get money from to pay their staff? Because, currently, thankfully, there's support for businesses.
Lynne Neagle AM: Janet, we're not doing Cylch Meithrin at the moment; we are sticking with schools, as we discussed in advance. Dawn.
Dawn Bowden AM: Can I just get some clarity, Steve, around what you were saying in terms of next week? Because I think the practical applications of this--and I understand that you don't know all of this yet, I understand that--the practical applications are what is coming to us, obviously, with constituents saying,'Well, what's going to happen to that?'Just so that I can be clear, are you saying that, at this stage, every headteacher will be in school on Monday, as will all their staff?
Steve Davies: Within the scope of the guidance in terms of their health, the expectation--and this will be conveyed in letters by the Minister today, to be made clear--is that they are closing for the majority of pupils, but our expectation within the guidance is that the headteacher with their staff will be coming in; for some to start the delivery of what we just described, but that will probably be small numbers, but more importantly to plan to ensure that, after the formal Easter period, which is school holidays, the schools are geared to cater for the range of pupils that we've been discussing.
Dawn Bowden AM: So, would you anticipate--again, I know this is all a bit'if and when', and it depends on the changing nature of the advice, but from what you're saying, I think we can probably anticipate that, as we go forward, there will probably be fewer schools opening and operable--that we may be moving those children on to fewer sites. Would that possibly--?
Kirsty Williams AM: That is a potential. So, we already know that one of our local authorities already has identified a strategic pattern of schools that they will want to operate in this way. That local authority has already chosen those locations, and is already having communications with how they will then staff those centres. So, that could well--. That, I expect, in the longer term, will be the nature of the provision that we will get to. But that's not for us to dictate. The local authorities are best placed to understand what is the best, pragmatic use of the resources that they have available; and of course those resources, primarily, are human beings. So, we've talked a lot this morning in the context of teaching staff, teaching assistants, but we're also having discussions with local authorities, and I met with the Council for Wales of Voluntary Youth Services this week, to look at deploying youth workers, to look to be deploying other staff that the local authority may employ, like sports development officers. There may be cultural officers that can have something to offer. Welsh Government will be talking with a range of our partners who perhaps their normal activities can't continue at the moment, but actually have personnel who want to add to this effort, who want to be able to be part of a provision going forward in the longer term, to be able to provide a great place for children to be. We want to give parents, who we are asking--. Let's think about it, in these worst of times, we're asking parents to leave their children so that they can go and do essential work, and some of that essential work is putting themselves at risk, potentially. And we want to give those parents confidence that, when they leave their child with us, that child will receive something really worthwhile, and they can direct all of their attention to doing their job.
Lynne Neagle AM: Just before you--. Janet, have you got a supplementary on schools now, not on early years settings?
Janet Finch-Saunders AM: I lost the signal before, so it's a little bit confusing at this end, so bear with me. Just in terms of the closure of schools, I have been asked by teachers what does new purpose--you may have covered it, but bear in mind [Inaudible. ]--mean in practice. And also, they're already asking what will next--? I know you said earlier that next week could look and probably will look significantly different than this week, but what can they expect to be happening next week in terms of this new purpose work?
Lynne Neagle AM: We've covered that, Janet.
Kirsty Williams AM: First of all, Janet, I just want to say thank you very much for your kind comments. That's really, really kind of you. We will be sending a letter today to clarify those positions. So, each school will receive letters today about the expectations of schools next week.
Lynne Neagle AM: I think you're having trouble hearing us, aren't you, so I think--?
Janet Finch-Saunders AM: No, I heard that loud and clear.
Lynne Neagle AM: But I think you missed the earlier comments, when we went into some detail on the new purpose of schools. So, I'm sorry about that; we are having some problems with the connection.
Janet Finch-Saunders AM: Yes, we couldn't get a signal.
Lynne Neagle AM: Dawn.
Dawn Bowden AM: Just in relation to special schools and how they will fit into this new purpose arrangement.
Kirsty Williams AM: Yes, they're absolutely central to that planning. We know, again, that some of these children are our most vulnerable and they are some of our most pressurised families. Therefore, the same situation that we've just described for maintained schools also applies to special schools. We'll be having discussions about what arrangements can be made for those children within their own usual settings. In some cases, that may not be possible. So, again, already local authorities are making different provision. Can I give a shout out to the work of Rhondda Cynon Taf in this regard, who are already doing some excellent work with regard to how they can keep in touch with their children who usually would attend their special schools. But, again, Steve can give more detail.
Steve Davies: I think special schools have already been hit by this challenge, because a significant proportion of their children, because of their conditions, have not been coming to school, they've been isolated. But the principle we've used there is, actually, even if it's a minority of children who go to those schools and are vulnerable, they deserve and need that support through the school. So, we would expect that to function with the focus on vulnerable children. But similarly, even in special schools, there will be children whose parents will be key workers, so we would expect them to apply that same principle. Just quickly in response to the earlier question, while we may bring some groups of children into separate schools, we'll have to continue with the principle of keeping social distance and any provision for a child in a special school in a different setting would be unlikely, given the nature of the special school, so we would look to cater for that within the original school.
Dawn Bowden AM: Just a couple more questions from me. It's likely, because I know it has already happened, that some schools might actually close before Monday. Some schools have already partially closed. Are you quite happy that headteachers still have the discretion to do that, if they feel that's the right thing to do?
Kirsty Williams AM: In this situation, the discretion of the head still remains. As I said, we will be communicating with all schools today about our expectations, if at all possible, to have schools open for staff to do some of this planning and to be able to respond to these priority needs that we've just talked about.
Steve Davies: The rationale of headteachers for closing schools up to now has been that they can't cope with the safety of the children. I think, moving forward, it's unlikely that that would be a rationale that headteachers would want to use for not engaging and planning for the future.
Dawn Bowden AM: We're only talking about one more day, now, anyway, aren't we? So, just in terms of confirmed cases in schools, is your view at this stage that, if there is a confirmed case in a school, once that school has been deep-cleaned, it can reopen again?
Kirsty Williams AM: If we had a confirmed case in a school, then all the usual mechanisms arranged by Public Health Wales would kick in at that point.
Dawn Bowden AM: Okay. And my final question is in relation to the position of early years and childcare settings. I know that kind of crosses over into somebody else's portfolio as well, but I think we know that. Certainly what I've seen, and I'm sure this is true elsewhere as well, we've seen nurseries closing down because the parents are actually taking the children out of those nurseries. I've got one in particular, there are kids from the ages of 6 to 12 years in there, and the parents are taking them out. They've got 30 staff there, catering for 200 children and no children to care for and the organisation, at this stage, is unable to claim on their insurance for the ongoing payment of those staff wages. Is there any advice that we can give to people in that situation at this stage?
Kirsty Williams AM: Sure. As you say, many of these settings are businesses--people's businesses and they play a hugely important role and it's a very worrying time for them. We have said that we will continue to pay for childcare, delivered under the childcare offer even when a child is unable, or a parent is unwilling, to take up that place. So, if that setting is receiving a childcare payment from the Welsh Government as part of our childcare offer, that will be paid, regardless of whether that child attends or not. And I know that we're also working with local authorities to ensure a similar position on Flying Start childcare and early education. So, that payment will be made, regardless of whether a child is attending. It's also important that childcare settings will be able to apply for the various packages of support that are being made available by my colleague, Ken Skates.
Lynne Neagle AM: Hefin, then Janet.
Hefin David AM: Yes, I'd just like to turn that around from the parents'point of view. With schools closing, there are a lot of parents then losing 10 hours of free childcare, but from a settings point of view, they'll continue to be able to receive, for the time being, the nursery care.
Kirsty Williams AM: Yes, so the decision that has been taken by my colleague, Julie Morgan, is that settings should stay open at the moment unless public health changes. That's being kept under constant review on public health. Again, the issue is that we know that that childcare is vital to many families, especially--and we're particularly concerned about those individuals who are trying to help us overcome and solve these problems. If you have any specific questions about that, we'll be happy to take them back to Julie Morgan.
Lynne Neagle AM: Janet.
Janet Finch-Saunders AM: Is this the Cylch question?
Lynne Neagle AM: Yes, please.
Janet Finch-Saunders AM: Sorry, thank you. Yes, just basically, Cylch Meithrin, there are concerns--[Interruption. ]
Lynne Neagle AM: We've lost Janet. We'll come back to her.
Kirsty Williams AM: I think if the issue is about funding for Cylch Meithrin, these are not normal circumstances. As a Welsh Government, we will take every step to provide continuity of funding, if at all possible. We will overcome this, and when we overcome this situation we find ourselves in, we will need those childcare settings, we will need those private businesses and we will need our Cylch Meithrin to be there to respond and to be able to go on doing the job that they usually do for us. And if there is any way that we can, as a Government, ensure that that happens by carrying on funding things, even if they are not able to run, all usual--[Inaudible. ]-- around service-level agreements are off. I'm not setting the precedent--let me make that absolutely clear. [Laughter. ] But, you know, we will not undermine businesses and voluntary provision like Cylch by withdrawing Welsh Government funding. I hope I've been clear.
Lynne Neagle AM: Okay, thank you for that.
Janet Finch-Saunders AM: Thank you, Kirsty.
Lynne Neagle AM: If we can move on to talk about exams, obviously you made the announcement yesterday. I completely understand that everything is a very fast-moving situation, but, as you know, there are a lot of questions that people have about young people who've put a lot of work in. Are you able to tell us any more today? In particular, have you got any idea about timescales now for setting out what the approach will be to handling the lack of summer exams?
Kirsty Williams AM: Yes, it is a devastating decision to have to have been taken, but I have done so on the very, very clear and unambiguous advice from Qualifications Wales. I met with Qualifications Wales and the WJEC yesterday. What was most important to them was that I made an early decision and I did not equivocate on what would happen for the exams. I was able to make an informal decision at that meeting, and then, of course, there is a formal process that we have to go through. That, now, allows Qualifications Wales and the exam board to operationalise that decision, and they will be communicating with schools as quickly as possible about what schools will need to do to ensure that the systems that they will now put in place can work. We are trying, as far as we can, as I understand it, to be able to mirror as closely as possible the usual results day, for instance. It might not be possible, because, of course, we're dealing with a situation that requires human beings to be involved in it, and those human beings could find themselves unwell. So, our best attempts will be to maintain the normal rhythm of an exams day in August, but that has to be caveated by the fact that we're dealing with difficult circumstances. But, the WJEC and Qualifications Wales will be making urgent communications to exam centres to explain what will need to happen next.
Lynne Neagle AM: Okay. Janet, you had a question on this.
Janet Finch-Saunders AM: Yes, I think I raised it yesterday, Kirsty, but you were receiving loads of questions. I'd just ask for some further clarification about coursework, because only 30 per cent of that is done. Years 11 and 13, typically, in my case they're what's been raised with me--do you have any advice for them?
Kirsty Williams AM: Okay, so, all exams are cancelled, but year 11 and year 13 will be given a grade--I think that's a distinction that people need to be aware of. That is because those years and those grades are gateway qualifications, and they are points of movement in the education system. So, it's really important for those students that they are not disadvantaged in any way by not being able to receive a grade that helps them to make a decision as a qualifying step into what they will do next, whether that be university, whether that be a degree apprenticeship or whether that be going into sixth form, into a college, into an apprenticeship or into some work-based learning opportunities. That's why we have to focus on those children, because for them, it is absolutely critical that we do. We are at an advantage in Wales, can I say? Because of the nature of our examination system, those students already have a lot of externally assessed work that we can use as a basis to move forward on. Because we've kept our AS-levels, we have got that data. Because we have a GCSE system--. Our year 11s, if they're doing triple science, they've already done 40 per cent of their paper, so we're very fortunate. Because of the structures that we have got in our qualification system, there is already lots and lots of externally-verified work that we can use, alongside, potentially, teacher evaluation of students as well. And I think that's really important. We're starting from a better base than simply having none of that externally-verified data. What will also be important is that these children have confidence in those qualifications, and so we will be looking at a modulated arrangement within Wales, and I know that Qualifications Wales are discussing with their counterparts across the UK a modulated system across the UK. So, actually, we can make sure that our standards are maintained by actually having that modulation across the UK. So, we know that those children never have to worry about the rigour that has gone into determining that grade. So, they can have real confidence.
Lynne Neagle AM: Okay. Helen Mary.
Helen Mary Jones AM: Thank you. A supplementary question that might feed into that moderation. You'll know that the National Union of Students has suggested that black and minority ethnic children and children from the working class, on the whole, don't do as well, in terms of their assessment by their own teachers. I don't know what their evidence is for that. We also know, of course, that boys tend to do better in exams, and girls tend to do better at coursework, for whatever reason that is. So, just to ask you at this early stage to build in those considerations around potential unconscious bias into that overall system that you're talking about. And, of course, you are right to say that, because we have got some elements of external moderation here, those factors may be less for us in Wales than they might for colleagues in England.
Kirsty Williams AM: Yes, I think we are starting at a different base, thank goodness. So, you're quite right. As I said, students will have done unit 1 papers last year if they're GCSE students. Dare I say it, some might even have done early entry. So, we still have elements of coursework that are externally verified. So, children might well have done lots of oral exams in their English and in their Welsh language. So, we have lots of pieces of work that will have been externally verified. I certainly will ensure that these concerns are passed on. I'm sure that Qualifications Wales are thinking about it. I have every confidence that they and the WJEC will come up with a very comprehensive way of establishing those grades, but I have to say, in some ways, I have to step back now, because you would not expect me, in normal circumstances, to dictate to the WJEC how much percentage goes for that, and how much percentage is allocated for that; that would not be appropriate for a Minister. My job is to make the decision on the examinations on the basis of having confidence that what can be put in place is fair and is equitable, and I have confidence that that will be the case.
Helen Mary Jones AM: Thank you.
Lynne Neagle AM: Suzy.
Suzy Davies AM: A few things from me. One is, obviously, pupils are being asked to work at home as well now, some of whom will be doing GCSE and A-level courses. So, there's just a question, generally, from me-- because we're encouraging these kids to carry on working--how that will be accommodated by Qualifications Wales, I guess, in this modulation process. It may be that your at-home work will be of a higher standard or a lower standard than a teacher would be expecting. Secondly, you mentioned the AS-levels, of course, as being of value at the moment, but we've got people in Year 12 who now won't be doing their ASs. Is there any steer at this stage about what they will be expected to do? Will they be doing two sets of exams next year, for example? Or is AS just off the table? In which case, how are the A2s going to be calculated in due course? And then, finally from me, we do have some vocational qualifications that are up for examination as well--your BTECs, and I think it's the Association of Accounting Technicians, which is a lot of computer-based learning--which is due to be examined within three weeks. Those aren't A-levels or GCSEs. I appreciate that you may not have the answer just at the moment, but are they off as well is the question, I guess?
Kirsty Williams AM: With regard to AS-levels--no final decision has been made for exactly how those students will be treated. There are a range of options that could be used, but again, we will want to be thinking about student well-being, fairness and equity in that regard, and I will update Members as soon as I have received definitive advice from Qualifications Wales around that, and that hasn't happened yet. With regard to other types of qualifications, as you will be aware, the vast majority of BTECs is a modular, continually-assessed piece of work, and we would have every expectation that BTECs will be able to be awarded, but clearly, those conversations are with awarding bodies--they tend to be UK awarding bodies, rather then necessarily our WJEC exam board--and those conversations are ongoing. But I have every expectation that those qualifications will be awarded and, of course, because of their nature there's even more evidence of continued assessment. Huw, I don't know if there's anything else that you would like to add about those types of qualifications.
Huw Morris: No. I think you've covered most of it. I don't have a definitive answer for the ATT qualification, but we can look into that and come back to you.
Suzy Davies AM: Well, I've just had a constituent ask, so that would be very helpful. And homeworking--
Kirsty Williams AM: Homeworking, right.
Suzy Davies AM: --is that going to count towards the assessments, overall assessments?
Kirsty Williams AM: Well, potentially, as I said. I don't know the exact elements. What will be absolutely necessary is that Qualifications Wales and the WJEC will be able to give absolute clarity and simplicity around how those grades will be arrived at, because parents, teachers and students will want to know that, and my expectation is on them to be able to clearly communicate what elements will and will not be taken into consideration when awarding those grades.
Suzy Davies AM: That's great. At least we covered it. Thank you, Minister--thank you, Kirsty.
Lynne Neagle AM: And, just before we move on, have the universities across the UK indicated that they are content with this approach going forward--content to accept students on this basis?
Kirsty Williams AM: Certainly. There have been discussions with universities and UCAS, of course, that this also has a bearing on. One of the--. And the views of university and how university terms might be impacted is one of the ways and one of the reasons that we've factored in to making these decisions. Those discussions with universities are ongoing, aren't they, Huw?
Huw Morris: Yes. So, we've been in regular conversation with Universities Wales and through them with Universities UK and we've received every indication that the approach that's been adopted here has been welcomed by the institutions. Those conversations will continue as we work through the practicalities of how the gradings that are awarded are going to feed through into university admissions decisions and enrolment.
Lynne Neagle AM: Okay, thank you. Well, we've got some questions now from Suzy on the potential closures of colleges and universities.
Suzy Davies AM: Okay. Well, it's a very general question, really. I appreciate you've already indicated there are lots of ongoing conversations, but my understanding is whether colleges or universities close is pretty much still at their own discretion. We're going to be asking some questions on emergency legislation shortly, which may impact on the answer you can give today, but what sort of conversations are you having with FE and HE at the moment about how they decide?
Kirsty Williams AM: Well, you're absolutely right. As we often say in this committee, universities are autonomous institutions--a status that they guard jealously and we would never want to question. Universities have been making the decision to move as much of their learning online as they possibly can and we continue to have conversations with them. Colleges are in a similar position, looking to do as much as they can to be able to provide continuity of learning via distance learning methods, and the Bill, potentially, does give us more powers of intervention in both the FE and the HE sector.
Suzy Davies AM: I might ask you about that in a minute, because I don't even know what the Bill says yet.
Kirsty Williams AM: Huw, I don't know if there's anything you want to add.
Huw Morris: No--just to confirm what's been said and also to add in that independent training providers, similarly autonomous, like colleges and universities, have been moving in the same direction. We've been very impressed with the maturity and forward-planning that's been adopted by all of those institutions and their representative bodies. We've got consistency in the approach and a common desire, and investment in moving towards online support for students.
Suzy Davies AM: And there's still this safety net idea. Certainly, colleges have indicated, as with schools, that, for the most vulnerable learners, they'll have something in place that might permit attendance on an individual basis.
Huw Morris: That's my understanding, yes, and, again, we've been in regular conversation with them about that. My understanding is that they're going to spend the next week working through the detail of how that will work for the institutions.
Suzy Davies AM: That's fair enough. And, presumably, education maintenance allowance will still be paid.
Kirsty Williams AM: Yes. Arrangements have been made to ensure that EMA continues to be paid to all students who are entitled.
Suzy Davies AM: That's right. You indicated that any Welsh Government support's going to stay, whatever the circumstances are--in your portfolio.
Kirsty Williams AM: Yes. I'm doing my best, but it's an absolute yes on the EMA. There will be no disruption to EMA.
Suzy Davies AM: Okay. You might get some further questions on HE and FE.
Lynne Neagle AM: Yes. We've got some further questions, indeed, from Helen Mary and then Hefin.
Helen Mary Jones AM: Now or in a bit?
Lynne Neagle AM: Yes.
Helen Mary Jones AM: Just further to EMA, of course, at the moment, that has an attendance qualification, doesn't it? And you don't get your EMA if you don't turn up. Should we take from your last answer that that attendance qualification doesn't apply anymore?
Kirsty Williams AM: Yes. They can't turn up if the institution is not open, and that's not their fault.
Helen Mary Jones AM: No, but that is something that's been a worry, so that's really encouraging to hear. Thinking about students in higher education, can you give an assurance that student maintenance payments will continue as normal? Is that the intention?
Kirsty Williams AM: Yes.
Helen Mary Jones AM: That's really good to hear. And have you given any special ministerial instruction to Student Finance Wales on processing applications for support or changes of circumstances, or is that something that's kind of ongoing at the moment?
Kirsty Williams AM: Those conversations are ongoing with the Student Loans Company. As I said, we anticipate no disruption to--. We don't anticipate any change in the approach to students as a result of this. Individual student circumstances could well change and our expectation would be that the Student Loans Company would respond to that. All I would say is, just to remind people: people who work for the Student Loans Company are no more able to resist this disease than anybody else. There will undoubtedly in some cases be really practical challenges to service delivery, simply because organisations could be losing staff because of illness or the need to self-isolate or because they are reacting to social-distancing messages from the Government. So, I think we just need to bear that in mind: that these organisations are doing their best, but, if they are badly affected by staff numbers being off because of the virus, then I hope people will give them due consideration.
Helen Mary Jones AM: Yes, that makes sense, of course, because we've been told that universities won't be able to entirely close, because there will be students who can't go home--
Kirsty Williams AM: It is their home.
Helen Mary Jones AM: --overseas students, for example. What discussions have you been having with the sector to make sure that those students'basic needs are met, that there's still food, shelter, whatever they need?
Kirsty Williams AM: Well, obviously, universities have a duty of care to those students that find themselves in those circumstances, and every conversation that Huw's been having would suggest that universities are well aware of their need to do that.
Huw Morris: We instituted a monitoring process very early on in the onset of the disease, not least because a number of institutions have campuses and activities in China and other parts of south-east Asia. And so, as the disease has progressed, we've seen lessons being learned from the support for students who are in isolation coming from there to the UK, and I am assured that the universities here in Wales have got processes in place that support those learners.
Helen Mary Jones AM: That's really helpful. And on this specifically--last question from me-- have you considered whether students might need to be refunded some of their tuition fees, should the academic year not be completed?
Huw Morris: So, as the institutions move more and more of their material and some of their assessment online, clearly, there are lessons that will need to be taken on board. There are established quality assurance and enhancement procedures in institutions to enable the tutors and other supporters to make sure that that material meets their needs. The intention in all of these institutions is that they will complete their course of study. There are appeals mechanisms and feedback mechanisms through the students union and through course committees and other things within institutions to make sure that any concerns or incomplete work are addressed. Failing those institutional mechanisms, there is a UK-wide system through the Office of the Independent Adjudicator for students to take forward any concerns that they have. So, we're confident that that system will be robust and will make sure that the students are getting a course of learning that meets their needs.
Lynne Neagle AM: Okay. Suzy, you had a supplementary.
Suzy Davies AM: No, Mr Morris has answered my question.
Lynne Neagle AM: Okay. We've got a couple more questions now on vulnerable learners. I've got Helen Mary, then Hefin.
Helen Mary Jones AM: I think, Chair, the Minister has already answered what the--. But thinking just a little bit more broadly about the mental health and well-being of staff and learners across a range of educational settings, or, indeed, young people who can't access educational settings, what considerations are you giving to how that mental health and well-being might be supported through what is an incredibly difficult time for everyone?
Kirsty Williams AM: Yes, that is correct. So, our expectation would be that during a prolonged period of closure--which I think, if we're honest, we have to acknowledge is what we're looking at--we would expect school staff--well-being staff, for instance in school--to be doing check-ins--phone check-ins, potentially, or FaceTime check-ins, with students, just to keep in touch with them as we go forward. We'll be looking to promote amongst young people a range of online facilities that are available--so, for instance, Meic website--so, looking to use a variety of platforms. We do, of course, have the formal NHS counselling services. I'm concerned, of course, that for some children their access to their counsellor is via their school. We know that, and we're just double checking the capacity of online counselling that already exists--online counselling tools that children already use because they don't want to go to the counsellor in the school and be seen in the school corridor going to the counsellor. They're already using those online methods and we expect to be able to continue, as far as possible, those kinds of mechanisms where children can have their mental health needs and their questions answered, and their worries. I think we have to remember that this is a really worrying time for children and young people. One of the reasons, again, that we wanted to keep schools going as long as possible--and teachers have been working so hard to do that--is because that routine of going into school and that normality is one that we've needed and wanted to maintain. Children will have worries about their own health; they'll have worries about the health of their parents and their grandparents; they will be consuming potentially media and news stories that have empty supermarket shelves. So, we need to understand, and I think we will also have to recognise, that this support will have to be ongoing once we're back to normal, and we will have to continue to look to support children in the longer term who will have lived through this experience. They are incredibly resilient, and they have been the champions of some of our public health messages. They are so much better and so much more compliant on the whole'washing your hands'and things like that than even adults have been. So, they are incredibly resilient, but we also have to recognise that it can be a really worrying time for them.
Helen Mary Jones AM: Can I just--? Just a supplementary to that--you've mentioned already, Kirsty, the importance of youth services, and, particularly thinking voluntarily youth services, you've given the commitment, when were talking about Mudiad Ysgolion Meithrin earlier, that services that are part-funded by grants through the Welsh Government, for example, thinking of the national youth voluntary service--will those be able to be maintained even if settings have had to be shut as well? Obviously, local authorities will have to make their own decisions about whether youth settings are kept open, but, in terms of the direct support from Welsh Government, can organisations that receive it rely on that through this time?
Kirsty Williams AM: No formal decision has been made, but if people are in receipt of a Government grant from my department to run a service and that service can no longer run because of the public--
Helen Mary Jones AM: Because it's not safe.
Kirsty Williams AM: --because it's not safe to do so, I do not foresee that we will be turning around and saying,'We'll have our money back, thank you very much.'Lynne Neagle AM: Okay, thank you.
Helen Mary Jones AM: That will make a lot of people happy, thank you. [Laughter. ]
Kirsty Williams AM: As I said, we are facing unprecedented circumstances. The normal rules of engagement have to change and, those organisations, we'll need them to be providing youth services for children when we are back to normal, and we wouldn't want to do anything that would undermine their ability to do that. Our call to the youth service is a call to arms, though. When we're trying to maintain services for vulnerable children and for front-line staff children, they have a valuable role to play and I know that local government and the Council for Wales of Voluntary Youth Services are already in discussion about how youth services--. Many of our youth services work on an outreach basis. Those traditional youth clubs, because of austerity, are not necessarily there anymore, so they are well used to being out and about and doing outreach work, and they will have an important part to play in the services that we talked about earlier.
Helen Mary Jones AM: Thank you.
Lynne Neagle AM: Okay, thank you. Hefin, briefly, and then we're going to take one final question from Suzy on emergency legislation.
Hefin David AM: All right. I'll declare an interest as a parent of a child with additional learning needs, although the question I'm about to ask doesn't reflect her interests. Additional learning needs pupils who are waiting outcomes of referrals--if they're currently waiting an outcome of a referral, will that process will be suspended or will it continue as normal? And, if it is suspended, will it pick up where it left off from this point?
Kirsty Williams AM: I think we have to recognise that the ability to deliver business as usual has been massively compromised. I'm sure people will try and continue to do their normal activities and their normal jobs, but that might not be possible. I will have to check that, Hefin, to be honest. I don't want to give you any false assurance if, actually, the intelligence on the ground is that that simply will not be able to happen. But we don't--
Hefin David AM: Can we have a clear line on that?
Kirsty Williams AM: We don't want to jeopardise anybody, but as I said, some of the normal services are simply not available as everybody turns their attention to trying to respond to the pandemic.
Lynne Neagle AM: Okay, thank you. Final question--because I know that the Minister's got a lot of things that she needs to get on with--from Suzy on emergency legislation.
Suzy Davies AM: I'm not going to ask you if you'll use any powers you get under the emergency legislation, but are you able to give us some indication of what they might be?
Kirsty Williams AM: Sure. For instance, the Bill will provide Welsh Ministers with powers to temporarily close schools or other educational institutions, childcare premises; powers to give temporary continuity direction--so, actually, the other way around, force things to be open--and to be able to direct resources. So, that includes, as I said, I could direct something to stay open if that institution was trying to close down. The powers also give flexibility to maybe be able to direct staff to other institutions that they would not normally work in, if that was part of our resilience needs. We'd also be looking at, for instance, relaxing requirements around ratios in childcare settings, or we might be wanting to do things around food. So, obviously, we have rules around the level of nutrition that schools should be giving their children. If there is a continuing role for schools in providing food, we might have to be a bit more flexible about what that might look like. So, those kinds of flexibilities--to be able to suspend things, direct things--that we would not normally have in normal circumstances.
Suzy Davies AM: Okay. And just to finish this one off--you may not be able to answer this one, in all fairness--in those situations where it's the Government who says'no'to various things, does that then help people in the situation of Dawn's nursery, and insurance claims suddenly become more likely?
Kirsty Williams AM: I'm not an expert on insurance, and I don't know if anybody here can help me. But what my understanding is, is that even where Government has given a direction that does not necessarily mean that you will be covered by your insurance. What we're finding in the private sector is that insurance companies are not paying out, because even when a Government has directed it, they do not regard this as a disruption to business. So, the insurance industry is not my area of expertise.
Suzy Davies AM: No, no, I accept that.
Kirsty Williams AM: It's not my area of expertise, but from what I understand from discussions around the Cabinet table, this is particularly problematic. Let me give you an example about how we've been trying to overcome some of this--it feels like an awfully long time ago now-- you'll be aware that we gave directions earlier around cancellation of school trips abroad. Trying to make sure that that direction came from the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, rather than the Department for Education was a real battle, because again there were fears that, unless that advice came from the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, insurance would not kick in, and that was a two-day discussion.
Suzy Davies AM: Okay. This is helpful to know, actually.
Kirsty Williams AM: So, these are the kinds of things that we're grappling with. But, as I said, thinking about it, that was only last week, but it feels like an aeon ago.
Suzy Davies AM: I'm not holding you to that, but it helps us manage the questions we get asked.
Kirsty Williams AM: Yes, but as I said, insurance is not my area of expertise.
Suzy Davies AM: No, but thank you for answering.
Lynne Neagle AM: Okay. Well, we've come to the end of our time. Can I thank you for attending this morning, and your officials? We do recognise what an incredibly challenging time this is, and we'd like to place on record our thanks to all of you for the work that you're doing to try and see us through this crisis. As usual, you'll be sent a transcript to check for accuracy following the meeting. Thank you again, all of you, for your attendance. Item 3, then, is a motion under Standing Order 17. 42 to resolve to exclude the public for the remainder of the meeting. Are Members content? Thank you.","Already, local authorities were making different provisions. Even in special schools, there would be children whose parents would be key workers. Therefore, they would expect them to expect those sChools to apply the same principle. They would have to continue with the principle of keeping social distance and any provision for a child in a special school in a different setting would be unlikely, given the nature of the special school. Thus, they would look to cater for that within the original school.",qmsum
"What were their opinions on support or changes of circumstances?
Lynne Neagle AM: Good morning, everyone. Welcome to the Children, Young People and Education Committee this morning. I've received apologies for absence from Sian Gwenllian, and I'm very pleased to welcome Helen Mary Jones, who is substituting for Sian today. Can I ask whether Members want to declare any interests, please? Can I just, then, place on record that I have got a son who was about to do A-levels, so is affected by the exam decision? We'll move on, then, to our substantive item today, which is an evidence session with the Welsh Government around the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on education in Wales. I'm very pleased to welcome Kirsty Williams, Minister for Education; Steve Davies, who is director of the education directorate; Huw Morris, who is the group director, skills, higher education and lifelong learning; and Rob Orford, who is the chief scientific adviser for health. Thank you all for coming. We know that this is a really difficult and pressurised time for everyone, and we appreciate your attendance. Minister, I understand you wanted to make an opening statement today.
Kirsty Williams AM: Yes, if that's okay, Chair. As you know, it's not usually my practice to do that, but I think it is important today. COVID-19 coronavirus is one of the most significant issues that the Welsh Government and the people of Wales have dealt with in recent times. Dealing with the impacts of this pandemic is extremely challenging. Things are changing on an hourly basis, and we have to make decisions quickly to ensure public safety. But I would like to assure you that our aim, and my aim, and my main concern as the education Minister is to protect all staff and pupils in our schools and other educational settings. But we also have a duty to ensure continuing and continuity of education. Public health is clearly the priority here, but that does not change our belief that no child should miss out on any education, unless absolutely necessary. So, the decision to close all schools from tomorrow for statutory education provision was not taken lightly, but I believe it was necessary, given the advice and recommendations that we had received from a public health perspective and the situation that was developing on the ground. From next week, schools will have a new purpose. They will help support those most in need, including people involved in the immediate response to the coronavirus outbreak, and I'm working with my colleagues in the Cabinet, with Government officials and our partners in local government to develop and finalise these plans. The key areas that we're looking at are supporting and safeguarding the vulnerable and ensuring continuity of learning. This includes all of those who benefit from free school meals and children with additional learning needs. I can confirm that all maintained schools in Wales already have access to a range of digital tools that can support distance learning through the world-class Hwb digital learning platform, including virtual classrooms and video-conferencing facilities. A guide on what tools are available and how schools can use them has been developed and is being promoted widely. Yesterday, I announced that, whilst there are no easy choices, we have agreed that the best way forward is not to proceed with the summer exam series. Learners due to sit these exams will be awarded a fair grade to recognise their work, drawing on a range of information that is available, and I will announce further details shortly, but I felt it necessary to give early certainty to students and to staff. I would like to put on record my thanks to everyone working in education settings for the hard work that they have put in over the last few months in dealing with the virus and ensuring that pupils have been able to continue to learn. We need to continue to do this work together, as we face the continuing challenges posed by the coronavirus. Diolch yn fawr.
Lynne Neagle AM: Thank you very much, Minister, for that statement. We'll go to questions from Members now, and I've got some questions from Dawn Bowden.
Dawn Bowden AM: Thank you, Chair. Can I thank you, Kirsty, for your statement and the really difficult decisions that you've been having to make? You've already indicated in your statement this morning that these decisions are not taken lightly, and we understand that that is the case across Government. So, thank you for what you've been doing. You've outlined a little bit further there in your statement to us this morning about the new purpose. I take from what you're saying that you haven't really developed that yet in terms of exactly what that is going to look like. You've talked about the children of key workers, free school meals, additional learning needs. Is there anything else you can tell us about that at the moment and how you might staff the schools in those particular areas?
Kirsty Williams AM: Thank you, Dawn. So, you're absolutely right, our priority now is to operationalise, with colleagues in local government and schools, a practical response. And I have to say, we're working to timescales that I would have hoped to have avoided, but given the fact that we're having to make these decisions quite quickly, I hope that you will understand that perhaps where we start on Monday might change when we have more time and more opportunities to develop programmes going forward. Steve will be able to give you more details of the practical work that has already been going on, but our expectation will be that schools will be playing an important part in providing safe and secure places for children of those on the front-line response to dealing with the coronavirus to attend, and work is already under way with local authorities and individual schools on what that will look like for the emergency situation on Monday. Our other priority is indeed free school meals, and, again, where we eventually end up might be a different place to where we are on Monday. Again, we're responding to the emergency situation that there will be families that were expecting a free school meal on Monday, and, again, individual schools and local authorities are developing those plans at pace to be able to provide an emergency response as we work out a longer term plan to deal with the situation. The same thing also goes for additional learning needs, and attending to the needs of that particular group of learners. So, those conversations began a few days ago. I had the opportunity to meet with the First Minister and Andrew Morgan, the leader of the Welsh Local Government Association, yesterday to talk about what local government could do, and what they were already doing. Those plans in some places are already quite developed, and are now working at pace, but I hope you will understand that where we start on Monday is the emergency response, and that work will develop as we go forward. But, Steve, perhaps you could--? Because Steve was the one making all those phone calls and doing the practical operational stuff, rather than me. Steve.
Steve Davies: In short, the new purpose is to meet the needs of particular groups of children and young people. In some cases, some of the response to supporting free school meals, in the short term in particular, we may use the schools as part of that, and I'm certain that will happen in some cases. The second area is looking at how we support the children of key workers. Now, there is still work to be done on identifying exactly the categories of key workers, but I think it's really encouraging that in my discussions yesterday--I spoke with all 22 directors of education, and the examples we're picking up in their work with schools is they're already ahead of the curve in working with schools. So, schools have identified the number of children with health workers. It will grow, and we will need to look at that range. Then, the third area is vulnerable children. They're vulnerable sometimes in terms of education other than at school, vulnerable in terms of mental health, and for those children, as well as having an experience that we want to be planned, some have compared it to a snow day, particularly on Monday, when you're putting something together in the short term, but it will not be a formal curriculum that those children would normally go through. So, the range of activities--some will be focused on educational activities, some will be cultural, some will be sporting, and that plan will be developed on the basis of the age range of children, which in some cases may go from extremely young children up to those at the age of 16 in our all-through schools, but there will be a planned set of activities to cater for those children. What we are doing currently--I have staff back at Cathays Park who are in touch and working with directors of education to ensure that schools over the next two days will have been able to identify, at least at the earlier stage, in terms of health workers, the type and numbers of people. There are already schools who have informed us, and local authorities, of their plans for these activities to be starting next week, which is quite amazing, actually, given where we are. But we are expecting, and we're writing to schools today, that during the course of next week, headteachers to be in schools, and with their staff, taking into consideration the health guidance as to which staff should or should not be in, and in that period from next Monday through the two-week period, to Easter, we expect staff to be both planning for delivery post Easter, but also, as I said, building on and reflecting the good practice that's already in place for schools that have engaged in activities, and I'm sure a number of them will be inviting and enabling those children to come in on Monday. So, Monday will be a challenge for some, and not all will be delivering it, but we will be working so that we can get as much as possible delivered for those groups over the next two weeks, and particularly to have resilient programmes post Easter for the groups of children in those three categories that I said.
Dawn Bowden AM: Those that have been identified. Can I just clarify one thing? One of the identified vulnerable groups would clearly be children on the at-risk register. They would be included.
Steve Davies: Yes, definitely. Vulnerable children, yes.
Kirsty Williams AM: In our discussions, we have asked local government to be working with the social services departments and individual schools to identify those children who may be in that situation. We know that, for some children, being at school is part of their safeguarding arrangements, and obviously we will need to be able to respond to those needs.
Steve Davies: I wrote specifically yesterday to all directors of education to be assured that, for those children, the register is up to date and the plans are in place. I'm working with Albert Heaney my colleague, the director for social services, who is meeting with the 22 directors of social services today to look to ensure that we are joined up in ensuring none of these children fall through the gap.
Lynne Neagle AM: Okay. I've got a supplementary from Hefin, and then Suzy.
Hefin David AM: A very quick and simple question: how are you going to communicate this to parents? There's a bigger picture and it's changing all the time, as you said. The Welsh Government have a route to communication. The most helpful thing I've seen is that Public Health Wales have a single website with information regarding the wider issue of the virus. How will this then be cascaded to schools, because there's obviously a time lag? So, have you considered how this is going to be communicated directly to parents?
Kirsty Williams AM: We're using all of our platforms of communication to get these messages across. So, we're using the more informal methods of communication, but are relying on a systematic approach via individual directors and through to individual schools. Welsh Government already has a dedicated website page with all of the relevant information about coronavirus. We're looking, as quickly as we can, to have a frequently asked education questions page that we can update. Understandably, people are communicating to us on Twitter asking questions. It is impossible for the communications team here to be able to respond individually to every single person that is sending Facebook messages and sending tweets, so the best way we can do that is to collate the types of questions people are asking and then to be able to have a frequently updated question and answer page to try to respond to that. With regard to parents, for instance, we're aware of schools that have already sent a questionnaire out last night to parents saying,'Do you consider yourself to be a key worker? Do you work in the NHS? Please let us know by tomorrow so we can put arrangements in place for your children.'So, schools are already taking the initiative and having those conversations with parents about what their needs will be. And, as I said, Hefin, will it be perfect on Monday? No. It won't be perfect by Monday, because we're working to such constrained timescales. But we will continue to build that resilience. We also have to think about systems that look at what might the epidemic do and have systems of resilience that may work next week, given the situation we find ourselves in with public health advice at the moment. But that public health advice may change. Therefore, have we got a system that will be resilient in those circumstances? These are some of the challenges that we're having to grapple with. So, as I said, what happens on Monday might look very different to where we are if schools are still off in May. So, I hope people will understand that we are working in those kinds of scenarios.
Lynne Neagle AM: Suzy, you had a supplementary.
Suzy Davies AM: Yes, just on this question of vulnerable children, I'm just wondering how much discretion teachers are going to have in including individual children who may not be obviously under social services'care or on a risk register or whatever. Teachers know their pupils and, very sensitively, they could include people who may not be obviously in need.
Kirsty Williams AM: We would absolutely respect the professional judgment of individual headteachers to be able to have those conversations with their directors. As you said, quite rightly, they are the individuals who know their children best and know which children, perhaps, will need this extra support. We will put no constraints on those teachers trying to do that work.
Suzy Davies AM: Okay. The second part of my question is: there were going to be Easter holidays anyway, weren't there? What was going to happen about free-school-meal children during that period? Has that gone out of the window now, the normal holiday provision for children? Because that's not there normally, is it, except in separate--
Kirsty Williams AM: We do find ourselves in a strange situation. My understanding is what we're trying to work to is that we would have ongoing provision and not to make some strange,'You get this for two weeks, then you don't get it for two weeks, and then you're back in.'My understanding is, in England, that is what they're going to do. We're trying to create a system where it will be seamless and it will not necessarily matter that two of those weeks were formally holidays. It won't matter to those nurses and doctors who will need to be in work during those weeks. We're trying to create a system that will run uniformly. That's our policy goal at the moment.
Lynne Neagle AM: Helen Mary.
Helen Mary Jones AM: Just briefly, building on Suzy's question, one particular group of children and young people that I hope will be eligible to be included in the potentially vulnerable category is young carers. For some of them, they may not be able to come into school because the people they're caring for may have to be excluded because of their conditions. But I think that, for other young carers, coming to school is an absolute lifeline, because they're working at home. So, I don't know if it's appropriate for you to specifically mention those in discussions with local authorities, but it's a group of young people who, again, may not be vulnerable in other ways, but because of their caring responsibilities they may need school. And the other group--and this, I suppose, goes back to Suzy's point about teachers knowing their young people--is the children who may be living in situations where they're at risk of witnessing domestic abuse. Again, these may very well not be children who are in any formal contact with social services, but being at home may be really not a good place for them to be. So, again, I'd put in an appeal for that to be something that perhaps can be raised with schools. If a teacher is worried about what a child's circumstances are like at home, whether they can be, as you said, Kirsty, included as one of the--. They may not be formally identified, but if the teacher knows that they're at risk, or there is an instinct that they're at risk, they might be able to be included in children who are allowed to take advantage of this special provision you're making at this difficult time.
Kirsty Williams AM: We will certainly raise those issues. We have to do that in the context of what is deliverable, and we also have to do that in the context of the public health advice that we are receiving as well. One of the reasons why schools are closing is to help manage this disease. We know that the ability for school closures to make a contribution to that diminishes if we have significant children in school still. So, we will take these issues into consideration, but remembering this is part of an epidemic mitigation plan. Rob is the expert on that, not me.
Rob Orford: Yes, absolutely. This is a rapidly-evolving problem and the scale is something that we haven't seen in 100 years, and so we're having to evolve and iterate things as we go. Next week, I think, will look different to this week. So, it kind of is what it is. We've all got a role to play, and schools certainly have a significant role to play in breaking those chains of transmission. Areas that we're worried about are displacement activities. If we close the schools, then people collect at others'houses. We need to send a really clear message that you're all part of the solution, and the things that you do by distancing yourselves from your friends and your family are really important for us to get on top of this outbreak. The more that we can do that, the easier it will be when we go forward.
Helen Mary Jones AM: I'm sure that that's true, but I'm sure that we wouldn't be wanting a child who's in a very pressured environment with perhaps a very difficult relationship between mum and dad--. It may be very important for those children to be out of that for some of the time. Hopefully, we're talking about relatively small numbers, but I just--.
Kirsty Williams AM: We will look at vulnerability in a holistic way.
Lynne Neagle AM: Janet, you had a supplementary.
Janet Finch-Saunders AM: Thank you, Chair, and good morning, Minister, and your team. Can I just put on record my thanks for all that you're having to endure at this moment? I think it's fair to say you have the support of Assembly Members and, indeed, our communities. Now, the question I have: if Cylch Meithrin have to close, where will they get money from to pay their staff? Because, currently, thankfully, there's support for businesses.
Lynne Neagle AM: Janet, we're not doing Cylch Meithrin at the moment; we are sticking with schools, as we discussed in advance. Dawn.
Dawn Bowden AM: Can I just get some clarity, Steve, around what you were saying in terms of next week? Because I think the practical applications of this--and I understand that you don't know all of this yet, I understand that--the practical applications are what is coming to us, obviously, with constituents saying,'Well, what's going to happen to that?'Just so that I can be clear, are you saying that, at this stage, every headteacher will be in school on Monday, as will all their staff?
Steve Davies: Within the scope of the guidance in terms of their health, the expectation--and this will be conveyed in letters by the Minister today, to be made clear--is that they are closing for the majority of pupils, but our expectation within the guidance is that the headteacher with their staff will be coming in; for some to start the delivery of what we just described, but that will probably be small numbers, but more importantly to plan to ensure that, after the formal Easter period, which is school holidays, the schools are geared to cater for the range of pupils that we've been discussing.
Dawn Bowden AM: So, would you anticipate--again, I know this is all a bit'if and when', and it depends on the changing nature of the advice, but from what you're saying, I think we can probably anticipate that, as we go forward, there will probably be fewer schools opening and operable--that we may be moving those children on to fewer sites. Would that possibly--?
Kirsty Williams AM: That is a potential. So, we already know that one of our local authorities already has identified a strategic pattern of schools that they will want to operate in this way. That local authority has already chosen those locations, and is already having communications with how they will then staff those centres. So, that could well--. That, I expect, in the longer term, will be the nature of the provision that we will get to. But that's not for us to dictate. The local authorities are best placed to understand what is the best, pragmatic use of the resources that they have available; and of course those resources, primarily, are human beings. So, we've talked a lot this morning in the context of teaching staff, teaching assistants, but we're also having discussions with local authorities, and I met with the Council for Wales of Voluntary Youth Services this week, to look at deploying youth workers, to look to be deploying other staff that the local authority may employ, like sports development officers. There may be cultural officers that can have something to offer. Welsh Government will be talking with a range of our partners who perhaps their normal activities can't continue at the moment, but actually have personnel who want to add to this effort, who want to be able to be part of a provision going forward in the longer term, to be able to provide a great place for children to be. We want to give parents, who we are asking--. Let's think about it, in these worst of times, we're asking parents to leave their children so that they can go and do essential work, and some of that essential work is putting themselves at risk, potentially. And we want to give those parents confidence that, when they leave their child with us, that child will receive something really worthwhile, and they can direct all of their attention to doing their job.
Lynne Neagle AM: Just before you--. Janet, have you got a supplementary on schools now, not on early years settings?
Janet Finch-Saunders AM: I lost the signal before, so it's a little bit confusing at this end, so bear with me. Just in terms of the closure of schools, I have been asked by teachers what does new purpose--you may have covered it, but bear in mind [Inaudible. ]--mean in practice. And also, they're already asking what will next--? I know you said earlier that next week could look and probably will look significantly different than this week, but what can they expect to be happening next week in terms of this new purpose work?
Lynne Neagle AM: We've covered that, Janet.
Kirsty Williams AM: First of all, Janet, I just want to say thank you very much for your kind comments. That's really, really kind of you. We will be sending a letter today to clarify those positions. So, each school will receive letters today about the expectations of schools next week.
Lynne Neagle AM: I think you're having trouble hearing us, aren't you, so I think--?
Janet Finch-Saunders AM: No, I heard that loud and clear.
Lynne Neagle AM: But I think you missed the earlier comments, when we went into some detail on the new purpose of schools. So, I'm sorry about that; we are having some problems with the connection.
Janet Finch-Saunders AM: Yes, we couldn't get a signal.
Lynne Neagle AM: Dawn.
Dawn Bowden AM: Just in relation to special schools and how they will fit into this new purpose arrangement.
Kirsty Williams AM: Yes, they're absolutely central to that planning. We know, again, that some of these children are our most vulnerable and they are some of our most pressurised families. Therefore, the same situation that we've just described for maintained schools also applies to special schools. We'll be having discussions about what arrangements can be made for those children within their own usual settings. In some cases, that may not be possible. So, again, already local authorities are making different provision. Can I give a shout out to the work of Rhondda Cynon Taf in this regard, who are already doing some excellent work with regard to how they can keep in touch with their children who usually would attend their special schools. But, again, Steve can give more detail.
Steve Davies: I think special schools have already been hit by this challenge, because a significant proportion of their children, because of their conditions, have not been coming to school, they've been isolated. But the principle we've used there is, actually, even if it's a minority of children who go to those schools and are vulnerable, they deserve and need that support through the school. So, we would expect that to function with the focus on vulnerable children. But similarly, even in special schools, there will be children whose parents will be key workers, so we would expect them to apply that same principle. Just quickly in response to the earlier question, while we may bring some groups of children into separate schools, we'll have to continue with the principle of keeping social distance and any provision for a child in a special school in a different setting would be unlikely, given the nature of the special school, so we would look to cater for that within the original school.
Dawn Bowden AM: Just a couple more questions from me. It's likely, because I know it has already happened, that some schools might actually close before Monday. Some schools have already partially closed. Are you quite happy that headteachers still have the discretion to do that, if they feel that's the right thing to do?
Kirsty Williams AM: In this situation, the discretion of the head still remains. As I said, we will be communicating with all schools today about our expectations, if at all possible, to have schools open for staff to do some of this planning and to be able to respond to these priority needs that we've just talked about.
Steve Davies: The rationale of headteachers for closing schools up to now has been that they can't cope with the safety of the children. I think, moving forward, it's unlikely that that would be a rationale that headteachers would want to use for not engaging and planning for the future.
Dawn Bowden AM: We're only talking about one more day, now, anyway, aren't we? So, just in terms of confirmed cases in schools, is your view at this stage that, if there is a confirmed case in a school, once that school has been deep-cleaned, it can reopen again?
Kirsty Williams AM: If we had a confirmed case in a school, then all the usual mechanisms arranged by Public Health Wales would kick in at that point.
Dawn Bowden AM: Okay. And my final question is in relation to the position of early years and childcare settings. I know that kind of crosses over into somebody else's portfolio as well, but I think we know that. Certainly what I've seen, and I'm sure this is true elsewhere as well, we've seen nurseries closing down because the parents are actually taking the children out of those nurseries. I've got one in particular, there are kids from the ages of 6 to 12 years in there, and the parents are taking them out. They've got 30 staff there, catering for 200 children and no children to care for and the organisation, at this stage, is unable to claim on their insurance for the ongoing payment of those staff wages. Is there any advice that we can give to people in that situation at this stage?
Kirsty Williams AM: Sure. As you say, many of these settings are businesses--people's businesses and they play a hugely important role and it's a very worrying time for them. We have said that we will continue to pay for childcare, delivered under the childcare offer even when a child is unable, or a parent is unwilling, to take up that place. So, if that setting is receiving a childcare payment from the Welsh Government as part of our childcare offer, that will be paid, regardless of whether that child attends or not. And I know that we're also working with local authorities to ensure a similar position on Flying Start childcare and early education. So, that payment will be made, regardless of whether a child is attending. It's also important that childcare settings will be able to apply for the various packages of support that are being made available by my colleague, Ken Skates.
Lynne Neagle AM: Hefin, then Janet.
Hefin David AM: Yes, I'd just like to turn that around from the parents'point of view. With schools closing, there are a lot of parents then losing 10 hours of free childcare, but from a settings point of view, they'll continue to be able to receive, for the time being, the nursery care.
Kirsty Williams AM: Yes, so the decision that has been taken by my colleague, Julie Morgan, is that settings should stay open at the moment unless public health changes. That's being kept under constant review on public health. Again, the issue is that we know that that childcare is vital to many families, especially--and we're particularly concerned about those individuals who are trying to help us overcome and solve these problems. If you have any specific questions about that, we'll be happy to take them back to Julie Morgan.
Lynne Neagle AM: Janet.
Janet Finch-Saunders AM: Is this the Cylch question?
Lynne Neagle AM: Yes, please.
Janet Finch-Saunders AM: Sorry, thank you. Yes, just basically, Cylch Meithrin, there are concerns--[Interruption. ]
Lynne Neagle AM: We've lost Janet. We'll come back to her.
Kirsty Williams AM: I think if the issue is about funding for Cylch Meithrin, these are not normal circumstances. As a Welsh Government, we will take every step to provide continuity of funding, if at all possible. We will overcome this, and when we overcome this situation we find ourselves in, we will need those childcare settings, we will need those private businesses and we will need our Cylch Meithrin to be there to respond and to be able to go on doing the job that they usually do for us. And if there is any way that we can, as a Government, ensure that that happens by carrying on funding things, even if they are not able to run, all usual--[Inaudible. ]-- around service-level agreements are off. I'm not setting the precedent--let me make that absolutely clear. [Laughter. ] But, you know, we will not undermine businesses and voluntary provision like Cylch by withdrawing Welsh Government funding. I hope I've been clear.
Lynne Neagle AM: Okay, thank you for that.
Janet Finch-Saunders AM: Thank you, Kirsty.
Lynne Neagle AM: If we can move on to talk about exams, obviously you made the announcement yesterday. I completely understand that everything is a very fast-moving situation, but, as you know, there are a lot of questions that people have about young people who've put a lot of work in. Are you able to tell us any more today? In particular, have you got any idea about timescales now for setting out what the approach will be to handling the lack of summer exams?
Kirsty Williams AM: Yes, it is a devastating decision to have to have been taken, but I have done so on the very, very clear and unambiguous advice from Qualifications Wales. I met with Qualifications Wales and the WJEC yesterday. What was most important to them was that I made an early decision and I did not equivocate on what would happen for the exams. I was able to make an informal decision at that meeting, and then, of course, there is a formal process that we have to go through. That, now, allows Qualifications Wales and the exam board to operationalise that decision, and they will be communicating with schools as quickly as possible about what schools will need to do to ensure that the systems that they will now put in place can work. We are trying, as far as we can, as I understand it, to be able to mirror as closely as possible the usual results day, for instance. It might not be possible, because, of course, we're dealing with a situation that requires human beings to be involved in it, and those human beings could find themselves unwell. So, our best attempts will be to maintain the normal rhythm of an exams day in August, but that has to be caveated by the fact that we're dealing with difficult circumstances. But, the WJEC and Qualifications Wales will be making urgent communications to exam centres to explain what will need to happen next.
Lynne Neagle AM: Okay. Janet, you had a question on this.
Janet Finch-Saunders AM: Yes, I think I raised it yesterday, Kirsty, but you were receiving loads of questions. I'd just ask for some further clarification about coursework, because only 30 per cent of that is done. Years 11 and 13, typically, in my case they're what's been raised with me--do you have any advice for them?
Kirsty Williams AM: Okay, so, all exams are cancelled, but year 11 and year 13 will be given a grade--I think that's a distinction that people need to be aware of. That is because those years and those grades are gateway qualifications, and they are points of movement in the education system. So, it's really important for those students that they are not disadvantaged in any way by not being able to receive a grade that helps them to make a decision as a qualifying step into what they will do next, whether that be university, whether that be a degree apprenticeship or whether that be going into sixth form, into a college, into an apprenticeship or into some work-based learning opportunities. That's why we have to focus on those children, because for them, it is absolutely critical that we do. We are at an advantage in Wales, can I say? Because of the nature of our examination system, those students already have a lot of externally assessed work that we can use as a basis to move forward on. Because we've kept our AS-levels, we have got that data. Because we have a GCSE system--. Our year 11s, if they're doing triple science, they've already done 40 per cent of their paper, so we're very fortunate. Because of the structures that we have got in our qualification system, there is already lots and lots of externally-verified work that we can use, alongside, potentially, teacher evaluation of students as well. And I think that's really important. We're starting from a better base than simply having none of that externally-verified data. What will also be important is that these children have confidence in those qualifications, and so we will be looking at a modulated arrangement within Wales, and I know that Qualifications Wales are discussing with their counterparts across the UK a modulated system across the UK. So, actually, we can make sure that our standards are maintained by actually having that modulation across the UK. So, we know that those children never have to worry about the rigour that has gone into determining that grade. So, they can have real confidence.
Lynne Neagle AM: Okay. Helen Mary.
Helen Mary Jones AM: Thank you. A supplementary question that might feed into that moderation. You'll know that the National Union of Students has suggested that black and minority ethnic children and children from the working class, on the whole, don't do as well, in terms of their assessment by their own teachers. I don't know what their evidence is for that. We also know, of course, that boys tend to do better in exams, and girls tend to do better at coursework, for whatever reason that is. So, just to ask you at this early stage to build in those considerations around potential unconscious bias into that overall system that you're talking about. And, of course, you are right to say that, because we have got some elements of external moderation here, those factors may be less for us in Wales than they might for colleagues in England.
Kirsty Williams AM: Yes, I think we are starting at a different base, thank goodness. So, you're quite right. As I said, students will have done unit 1 papers last year if they're GCSE students. Dare I say it, some might even have done early entry. So, we still have elements of coursework that are externally verified. So, children might well have done lots of oral exams in their English and in their Welsh language. So, we have lots of pieces of work that will have been externally verified. I certainly will ensure that these concerns are passed on. I'm sure that Qualifications Wales are thinking about it. I have every confidence that they and the WJEC will come up with a very comprehensive way of establishing those grades, but I have to say, in some ways, I have to step back now, because you would not expect me, in normal circumstances, to dictate to the WJEC how much percentage goes for that, and how much percentage is allocated for that; that would not be appropriate for a Minister. My job is to make the decision on the examinations on the basis of having confidence that what can be put in place is fair and is equitable, and I have confidence that that will be the case.
Helen Mary Jones AM: Thank you.
Lynne Neagle AM: Suzy.
Suzy Davies AM: A few things from me. One is, obviously, pupils are being asked to work at home as well now, some of whom will be doing GCSE and A-level courses. So, there's just a question, generally, from me-- because we're encouraging these kids to carry on working--how that will be accommodated by Qualifications Wales, I guess, in this modulation process. It may be that your at-home work will be of a higher standard or a lower standard than a teacher would be expecting. Secondly, you mentioned the AS-levels, of course, as being of value at the moment, but we've got people in Year 12 who now won't be doing their ASs. Is there any steer at this stage about what they will be expected to do? Will they be doing two sets of exams next year, for example? Or is AS just off the table? In which case, how are the A2s going to be calculated in due course? And then, finally from me, we do have some vocational qualifications that are up for examination as well--your BTECs, and I think it's the Association of Accounting Technicians, which is a lot of computer-based learning--which is due to be examined within three weeks. Those aren't A-levels or GCSEs. I appreciate that you may not have the answer just at the moment, but are they off as well is the question, I guess?
Kirsty Williams AM: With regard to AS-levels--no final decision has been made for exactly how those students will be treated. There are a range of options that could be used, but again, we will want to be thinking about student well-being, fairness and equity in that regard, and I will update Members as soon as I have received definitive advice from Qualifications Wales around that, and that hasn't happened yet. With regard to other types of qualifications, as you will be aware, the vast majority of BTECs is a modular, continually-assessed piece of work, and we would have every expectation that BTECs will be able to be awarded, but clearly, those conversations are with awarding bodies--they tend to be UK awarding bodies, rather then necessarily our WJEC exam board--and those conversations are ongoing. But I have every expectation that those qualifications will be awarded and, of course, because of their nature there's even more evidence of continued assessment. Huw, I don't know if there's anything else that you would like to add about those types of qualifications.
Huw Morris: No. I think you've covered most of it. I don't have a definitive answer for the ATT qualification, but we can look into that and come back to you.
Suzy Davies AM: Well, I've just had a constituent ask, so that would be very helpful. And homeworking--
Kirsty Williams AM: Homeworking, right.
Suzy Davies AM: --is that going to count towards the assessments, overall assessments?
Kirsty Williams AM: Well, potentially, as I said. I don't know the exact elements. What will be absolutely necessary is that Qualifications Wales and the WJEC will be able to give absolute clarity and simplicity around how those grades will be arrived at, because parents, teachers and students will want to know that, and my expectation is on them to be able to clearly communicate what elements will and will not be taken into consideration when awarding those grades.
Suzy Davies AM: That's great. At least we covered it. Thank you, Minister--thank you, Kirsty.
Lynne Neagle AM: And, just before we move on, have the universities across the UK indicated that they are content with this approach going forward--content to accept students on this basis?
Kirsty Williams AM: Certainly. There have been discussions with universities and UCAS, of course, that this also has a bearing on. One of the--. And the views of university and how university terms might be impacted is one of the ways and one of the reasons that we've factored in to making these decisions. Those discussions with universities are ongoing, aren't they, Huw?
Huw Morris: Yes. So, we've been in regular conversation with Universities Wales and through them with Universities UK and we've received every indication that the approach that's been adopted here has been welcomed by the institutions. Those conversations will continue as we work through the practicalities of how the gradings that are awarded are going to feed through into university admissions decisions and enrolment.
Lynne Neagle AM: Okay, thank you. Well, we've got some questions now from Suzy on the potential closures of colleges and universities.
Suzy Davies AM: Okay. Well, it's a very general question, really. I appreciate you've already indicated there are lots of ongoing conversations, but my understanding is whether colleges or universities close is pretty much still at their own discretion. We're going to be asking some questions on emergency legislation shortly, which may impact on the answer you can give today, but what sort of conversations are you having with FE and HE at the moment about how they decide?
Kirsty Williams AM: Well, you're absolutely right. As we often say in this committee, universities are autonomous institutions--a status that they guard jealously and we would never want to question. Universities have been making the decision to move as much of their learning online as they possibly can and we continue to have conversations with them. Colleges are in a similar position, looking to do as much as they can to be able to provide continuity of learning via distance learning methods, and the Bill, potentially, does give us more powers of intervention in both the FE and the HE sector.
Suzy Davies AM: I might ask you about that in a minute, because I don't even know what the Bill says yet.
Kirsty Williams AM: Huw, I don't know if there's anything you want to add.
Huw Morris: No--just to confirm what's been said and also to add in that independent training providers, similarly autonomous, like colleges and universities, have been moving in the same direction. We've been very impressed with the maturity and forward-planning that's been adopted by all of those institutions and their representative bodies. We've got consistency in the approach and a common desire, and investment in moving towards online support for students.
Suzy Davies AM: And there's still this safety net idea. Certainly, colleges have indicated, as with schools, that, for the most vulnerable learners, they'll have something in place that might permit attendance on an individual basis.
Huw Morris: That's my understanding, yes, and, again, we've been in regular conversation with them about that. My understanding is that they're going to spend the next week working through the detail of how that will work for the institutions.
Suzy Davies AM: That's fair enough. And, presumably, education maintenance allowance will still be paid.
Kirsty Williams AM: Yes. Arrangements have been made to ensure that EMA continues to be paid to all students who are entitled.
Suzy Davies AM: That's right. You indicated that any Welsh Government support's going to stay, whatever the circumstances are--in your portfolio.
Kirsty Williams AM: Yes. I'm doing my best, but it's an absolute yes on the EMA. There will be no disruption to EMA.
Suzy Davies AM: Okay. You might get some further questions on HE and FE.
Lynne Neagle AM: Yes. We've got some further questions, indeed, from Helen Mary and then Hefin.
Helen Mary Jones AM: Now or in a bit?
Lynne Neagle AM: Yes.
Helen Mary Jones AM: Just further to EMA, of course, at the moment, that has an attendance qualification, doesn't it? And you don't get your EMA if you don't turn up. Should we take from your last answer that that attendance qualification doesn't apply anymore?
Kirsty Williams AM: Yes. They can't turn up if the institution is not open, and that's not their fault.
Helen Mary Jones AM: No, but that is something that's been a worry, so that's really encouraging to hear. Thinking about students in higher education, can you give an assurance that student maintenance payments will continue as normal? Is that the intention?
Kirsty Williams AM: Yes.
Helen Mary Jones AM: That's really good to hear. And have you given any special ministerial instruction to Student Finance Wales on processing applications for support or changes of circumstances, or is that something that's kind of ongoing at the moment?
Kirsty Williams AM: Those conversations are ongoing with the Student Loans Company. As I said, we anticipate no disruption to--. We don't anticipate any change in the approach to students as a result of this. Individual student circumstances could well change and our expectation would be that the Student Loans Company would respond to that. All I would say is, just to remind people: people who work for the Student Loans Company are no more able to resist this disease than anybody else. There will undoubtedly in some cases be really practical challenges to service delivery, simply because organisations could be losing staff because of illness or the need to self-isolate or because they are reacting to social-distancing messages from the Government. So, I think we just need to bear that in mind: that these organisations are doing their best, but, if they are badly affected by staff numbers being off because of the virus, then I hope people will give them due consideration.
Helen Mary Jones AM: Yes, that makes sense, of course, because we've been told that universities won't be able to entirely close, because there will be students who can't go home--
Kirsty Williams AM: It is their home.
Helen Mary Jones AM: --overseas students, for example. What discussions have you been having with the sector to make sure that those students'basic needs are met, that there's still food, shelter, whatever they need?
Kirsty Williams AM: Well, obviously, universities have a duty of care to those students that find themselves in those circumstances, and every conversation that Huw's been having would suggest that universities are well aware of their need to do that.
Huw Morris: We instituted a monitoring process very early on in the onset of the disease, not least because a number of institutions have campuses and activities in China and other parts of south-east Asia. And so, as the disease has progressed, we've seen lessons being learned from the support for students who are in isolation coming from there to the UK, and I am assured that the universities here in Wales have got processes in place that support those learners.
Helen Mary Jones AM: That's really helpful. And on this specifically--last question from me-- have you considered whether students might need to be refunded some of their tuition fees, should the academic year not be completed?
Huw Morris: So, as the institutions move more and more of their material and some of their assessment online, clearly, there are lessons that will need to be taken on board. There are established quality assurance and enhancement procedures in institutions to enable the tutors and other supporters to make sure that that material meets their needs. The intention in all of these institutions is that they will complete their course of study. There are appeals mechanisms and feedback mechanisms through the students union and through course committees and other things within institutions to make sure that any concerns or incomplete work are addressed. Failing those institutional mechanisms, there is a UK-wide system through the Office of the Independent Adjudicator for students to take forward any concerns that they have. So, we're confident that that system will be robust and will make sure that the students are getting a course of learning that meets their needs.
Lynne Neagle AM: Okay. Suzy, you had a supplementary.
Suzy Davies AM: No, Mr Morris has answered my question.
Lynne Neagle AM: Okay. We've got a couple more questions now on vulnerable learners. I've got Helen Mary, then Hefin.
Helen Mary Jones AM: I think, Chair, the Minister has already answered what the--. But thinking just a little bit more broadly about the mental health and well-being of staff and learners across a range of educational settings, or, indeed, young people who can't access educational settings, what considerations are you giving to how that mental health and well-being might be supported through what is an incredibly difficult time for everyone?
Kirsty Williams AM: Yes, that is correct. So, our expectation would be that during a prolonged period of closure--which I think, if we're honest, we have to acknowledge is what we're looking at--we would expect school staff--well-being staff, for instance in school--to be doing check-ins--phone check-ins, potentially, or FaceTime check-ins, with students, just to keep in touch with them as we go forward. We'll be looking to promote amongst young people a range of online facilities that are available--so, for instance, Meic website--so, looking to use a variety of platforms. We do, of course, have the formal NHS counselling services. I'm concerned, of course, that for some children their access to their counsellor is via their school. We know that, and we're just double checking the capacity of online counselling that already exists--online counselling tools that children already use because they don't want to go to the counsellor in the school and be seen in the school corridor going to the counsellor. They're already using those online methods and we expect to be able to continue, as far as possible, those kinds of mechanisms where children can have their mental health needs and their questions answered, and their worries. I think we have to remember that this is a really worrying time for children and young people. One of the reasons, again, that we wanted to keep schools going as long as possible--and teachers have been working so hard to do that--is because that routine of going into school and that normality is one that we've needed and wanted to maintain. Children will have worries about their own health; they'll have worries about the health of their parents and their grandparents; they will be consuming potentially media and news stories that have empty supermarket shelves. So, we need to understand, and I think we will also have to recognise, that this support will have to be ongoing once we're back to normal, and we will have to continue to look to support children in the longer term who will have lived through this experience. They are incredibly resilient, and they have been the champions of some of our public health messages. They are so much better and so much more compliant on the whole'washing your hands'and things like that than even adults have been. So, they are incredibly resilient, but we also have to recognise that it can be a really worrying time for them.
Helen Mary Jones AM: Can I just--? Just a supplementary to that--you've mentioned already, Kirsty, the importance of youth services, and, particularly thinking voluntarily youth services, you've given the commitment, when were talking about Mudiad Ysgolion Meithrin earlier, that services that are part-funded by grants through the Welsh Government, for example, thinking of the national youth voluntary service--will those be able to be maintained even if settings have had to be shut as well? Obviously, local authorities will have to make their own decisions about whether youth settings are kept open, but, in terms of the direct support from Welsh Government, can organisations that receive it rely on that through this time?
Kirsty Williams AM: No formal decision has been made, but if people are in receipt of a Government grant from my department to run a service and that service can no longer run because of the public--
Helen Mary Jones AM: Because it's not safe.
Kirsty Williams AM: --because it's not safe to do so, I do not foresee that we will be turning around and saying,'We'll have our money back, thank you very much.'Lynne Neagle AM: Okay, thank you.
Helen Mary Jones AM: That will make a lot of people happy, thank you. [Laughter. ]
Kirsty Williams AM: As I said, we are facing unprecedented circumstances. The normal rules of engagement have to change and, those organisations, we'll need them to be providing youth services for children when we are back to normal, and we wouldn't want to do anything that would undermine their ability to do that. Our call to the youth service is a call to arms, though. When we're trying to maintain services for vulnerable children and for front-line staff children, they have a valuable role to play and I know that local government and the Council for Wales of Voluntary Youth Services are already in discussion about how youth services--. Many of our youth services work on an outreach basis. Those traditional youth clubs, because of austerity, are not necessarily there anymore, so they are well used to being out and about and doing outreach work, and they will have an important part to play in the services that we talked about earlier.
Helen Mary Jones AM: Thank you.
Lynne Neagle AM: Okay, thank you. Hefin, briefly, and then we're going to take one final question from Suzy on emergency legislation.
Hefin David AM: All right. I'll declare an interest as a parent of a child with additional learning needs, although the question I'm about to ask doesn't reflect her interests. Additional learning needs pupils who are waiting outcomes of referrals--if they're currently waiting an outcome of a referral, will that process will be suspended or will it continue as normal? And, if it is suspended, will it pick up where it left off from this point?
Kirsty Williams AM: I think we have to recognise that the ability to deliver business as usual has been massively compromised. I'm sure people will try and continue to do their normal activities and their normal jobs, but that might not be possible. I will have to check that, Hefin, to be honest. I don't want to give you any false assurance if, actually, the intelligence on the ground is that that simply will not be able to happen. But we don't--
Hefin David AM: Can we have a clear line on that?
Kirsty Williams AM: We don't want to jeopardise anybody, but as I said, some of the normal services are simply not available as everybody turns their attention to trying to respond to the pandemic.
Lynne Neagle AM: Okay, thank you. Final question--because I know that the Minister's got a lot of things that she needs to get on with--from Suzy on emergency legislation.
Suzy Davies AM: I'm not going to ask you if you'll use any powers you get under the emergency legislation, but are you able to give us some indication of what they might be?
Kirsty Williams AM: Sure. For instance, the Bill will provide Welsh Ministers with powers to temporarily close schools or other educational institutions, childcare premises; powers to give temporary continuity direction--so, actually, the other way around, force things to be open--and to be able to direct resources. So, that includes, as I said, I could direct something to stay open if that institution was trying to close down. The powers also give flexibility to maybe be able to direct staff to other institutions that they would not normally work in, if that was part of our resilience needs. We'd also be looking at, for instance, relaxing requirements around ratios in childcare settings, or we might be wanting to do things around food. So, obviously, we have rules around the level of nutrition that schools should be giving their children. If there is a continuing role for schools in providing food, we might have to be a bit more flexible about what that might look like. So, those kinds of flexibilities--to be able to suspend things, direct things--that we would not normally have in normal circumstances.
Suzy Davies AM: Okay. And just to finish this one off--you may not be able to answer this one, in all fairness--in those situations where it's the Government who says'no'to various things, does that then help people in the situation of Dawn's nursery, and insurance claims suddenly become more likely?
Kirsty Williams AM: I'm not an expert on insurance, and I don't know if anybody here can help me. But what my understanding is, is that even where Government has given a direction that does not necessarily mean that you will be covered by your insurance. What we're finding in the private sector is that insurance companies are not paying out, because even when a Government has directed it, they do not regard this as a disruption to business. So, the insurance industry is not my area of expertise.
Suzy Davies AM: No, no, I accept that.
Kirsty Williams AM: It's not my area of expertise, but from what I understand from discussions around the Cabinet table, this is particularly problematic. Let me give you an example about how we've been trying to overcome some of this--it feels like an awfully long time ago now-- you'll be aware that we gave directions earlier around cancellation of school trips abroad. Trying to make sure that that direction came from the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, rather than the Department for Education was a real battle, because again there were fears that, unless that advice came from the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, insurance would not kick in, and that was a two-day discussion.
Suzy Davies AM: Okay. This is helpful to know, actually.
Kirsty Williams AM: So, these are the kinds of things that we're grappling with. But, as I said, thinking about it, that was only last week, but it feels like an aeon ago.
Suzy Davies AM: I'm not holding you to that, but it helps us manage the questions we get asked.
Kirsty Williams AM: Yes, but as I said, insurance is not my area of expertise.
Suzy Davies AM: No, but thank you for answering.
Lynne Neagle AM: Okay. Well, we've come to the end of our time. Can I thank you for attending this morning, and your officials? We do recognise what an incredibly challenging time this is, and we'd like to place on record our thanks to all of you for the work that you're doing to try and see us through this crisis. As usual, you'll be sent a transcript to check for accuracy following the meeting. Thank you again, all of you, for your attendance. Item 3, then, is a motion under Standing Order 17. 42 to resolve to exclude the public for the remainder of the meeting. Are Members content? Thank you.","Actually, they did not anticipate any change in the approach to students. Individual student circumstances could well change and their expectation would be that the Student Loans Company would respond to that.

"Summarize the whole meeting.
Lynne Neagle AM: Good morning, everyone. Welcome to the Children, Young People and Education Committee this morning. I've received apologies for absence from Sian Gwenllian, and I'm very pleased to welcome Helen Mary Jones, who is substituting for Sian today. Can I ask whether Members want to declare any interests, please? Can I just, then, place on record that I have got a son who was about to do A-levels, so is affected by the exam decision? We'll move on, then, to our substantive item today, which is an evidence session with the Welsh Government around the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on education in Wales. I'm very pleased to welcome Kirsty Williams, Minister for Education; Steve Davies, who is director of the education directorate; Huw Morris, who is the group director, skills, higher education and lifelong learning; and Rob Orford, who is the chief scientific adviser for health. Thank you all for coming. We know that this is a really difficult and pressurised time for everyone, and we appreciate your attendance. Minister, I understand you wanted to make an opening statement today.
Kirsty Williams AM: Yes, if that's okay, Chair. As you know, it's not usually my practice to do that, but I think it is important today. COVID-19 coronavirus is one of the most significant issues that the Welsh Government and the people of Wales have dealt with in recent times. Dealing with the impacts of this pandemic is extremely challenging. Things are changing on an hourly basis, and we have to make decisions quickly to ensure public safety. But I would like to assure you that our aim, and my aim, and my main concern as the education Minister is to protect all staff and pupils in our schools and other educational settings. But we also have a duty to ensure continuing and continuity of education. Public health is clearly the priority here, but that does not change our belief that no child should miss out on any education, unless absolutely necessary. So, the decision to close all schools from tomorrow for statutory education provision was not taken lightly, but I believe it was necessary, given the advice and recommendations that we had received from a public health perspective and the situation that was developing on the ground. From next week, schools will have a new purpose. They will help support those most in need, including people involved in the immediate response to the coronavirus outbreak, and I'm working with my colleagues in the Cabinet, with Government officials and our partners in local government to develop and finalise these plans. The key areas that we're looking at are supporting and safeguarding the vulnerable and ensuring continuity of learning. This includes all of those who benefit from free school meals and children with additional learning needs. I can confirm that all maintained schools in Wales already have access to a range of digital tools that can support distance learning through the world-class Hwb digital learning platform, including virtual classrooms and video-conferencing facilities. A guide on what tools are available and how schools can use them has been developed and is being promoted widely. Yesterday, I announced that, whilst there are no easy choices, we have agreed that the best way forward is not to proceed with the summer exam series. Learners due to sit these exams will be awarded a fair grade to recognise their work, drawing on a range of information that is available, and I will announce further details shortly, but I felt it necessary to give early certainty to students and to staff. I would like to put on record my thanks to everyone working in education settings for the hard work that they have put in over the last few months in dealing with the virus and ensuring that pupils have been able to continue to learn. We need to continue to do this work together, as we face the continuing challenges posed by the coronavirus. Diolch yn fawr.
Lynne Neagle AM: Thank you very much, Minister, for that statement. We'll go to questions from Members now, and I've got some questions from Dawn Bowden.
Dawn Bowden AM: Thank you, Chair. Can I thank you, Kirsty, for your statement and the really difficult decisions that you've been having to make? You've already indicated in your statement this morning that these decisions are not taken lightly, and we understand that that is the case across Government. So, thank you for what you've been doing. You've outlined a little bit further there in your statement to us this morning about the new purpose. I take from what you're saying that you haven't really developed that yet in terms of exactly what that is going to look like. You've talked about the children of key workers, free school meals, additional learning needs. Is there anything else you can tell us about that at the moment and how you might staff the schools in those particular areas?
Kirsty Williams AM: Thank you, Dawn. So, you're absolutely right, our priority now is to operationalise, with colleagues in local government and schools, a practical response. And I have to say, we're working to timescales that I would have hoped to have avoided, but given the fact that we're having to make these decisions quite quickly, I hope that you will understand that perhaps where we start on Monday might change when we have more time and more opportunities to develop programmes going forward. Steve will be able to give you more details of the practical work that has already been going on, but our expectation will be that schools will be playing an important part in providing safe and secure places for children of those on the front-line response to dealing with the coronavirus to attend, and work is already under way with local authorities and individual schools on what that will look like for the emergency situation on Monday. Our other priority is indeed free school meals, and, again, where we eventually end up might be a different place to where we are on Monday. Again, we're responding to the emergency situation that there will be families that were expecting a free school meal on Monday, and, again, individual schools and local authorities are developing those plans at pace to be able to provide an emergency response as we work out a longer term plan to deal with the situation. The same thing also goes for additional learning needs, and attending to the needs of that particular group of learners. So, those conversations began a few days ago. I had the opportunity to meet with the First Minister and Andrew Morgan, the leader of the Welsh Local Government Association, yesterday to talk about what local government could do, and what they were already doing. Those plans in some places are already quite developed, and are now working at pace, but I hope you will understand that where we start on Monday is the emergency response, and that work will develop as we go forward. But, Steve, perhaps you could--? Because Steve was the one making all those phone calls and doing the practical operational stuff, rather than me. Steve.
Steve Davies: In short, the new purpose is to meet the needs of particular groups of children and young people. In some cases, some of the response to supporting free school meals, in the short term in particular, we may use the schools as part of that, and I'm certain that will happen in some cases. The second area is looking at how we support the children of key workers. Now, there is still work to be done on identifying exactly the categories of key workers, but I think it's really encouraging that in my discussions yesterday--I spoke with all 22 directors of education, and the examples we're picking up in their work with schools is they're already ahead of the curve in working with schools. So, schools have identified the number of children with health workers. It will grow, and we will need to look at that range. Then, the third area is vulnerable children. They're vulnerable sometimes in terms of education other than at school, vulnerable in terms of mental health, and for those children, as well as having an experience that we want to be planned, some have compared it to a snow day, particularly on Monday, when you're putting something together in the short term, but it will not be a formal curriculum that those children would normally go through. So, the range of activities--some will be focused on educational activities, some will be cultural, some will be sporting, and that plan will be developed on the basis of the age range of children, which in some cases may go from extremely young children up to those at the age of 16 in our all-through schools, but there will be a planned set of activities to cater for those children. What we are doing currently--I have staff back at Cathays Park who are in touch and working with directors of education to ensure that schools over the next two days will have been able to identify, at least at the earlier stage, in terms of health workers, the type and numbers of people. There are already schools who have informed us, and local authorities, of their plans for these activities to be starting next week, which is quite amazing, actually, given where we are. But we are expecting, and we're writing to schools today, that during the course of next week, headteachers to be in schools, and with their staff, taking into consideration the health guidance as to which staff should or should not be in, and in that period from next Monday through the two-week period, to Easter, we expect staff to be both planning for delivery post Easter, but also, as I said, building on and reflecting the good practice that's already in place for schools that have engaged in activities, and I'm sure a number of them will be inviting and enabling those children to come in on Monday. So, Monday will be a challenge for some, and not all will be delivering it, but we will be working so that we can get as much as possible delivered for those groups over the next two weeks, and particularly to have resilient programmes post Easter for the groups of children in those three categories that I said.
Dawn Bowden AM: Those that have been identified. Can I just clarify one thing? One of the identified vulnerable groups would clearly be children on the at-risk register. They would be included.
Steve Davies: Yes, definitely. Vulnerable children, yes.
Kirsty Williams AM: In our discussions, we have asked local government to be working with the social services departments and individual schools to identify those children who may be in that situation. We know that, for some children, being at school is part of their safeguarding arrangements, and obviously we will need to be able to respond to those needs.
Steve Davies: I wrote specifically yesterday to all directors of education to be assured that, for those children, the register is up to date and the plans are in place. I'm working with Albert Heaney my colleague, the director for social services, who is meeting with the 22 directors of social services today to look to ensure that we are joined up in ensuring none of these children fall through the gap.
Lynne Neagle AM: Okay. I've got a supplementary from Hefin, and then Suzy.
Hefin David AM: A very quick and simple question: how are you going to communicate this to parents? There's a bigger picture and it's changing all the time, as you said. The Welsh Government have a route to communication. The most helpful thing I've seen is that Public Health Wales have a single website with information regarding the wider issue of the virus. How will this then be cascaded to schools, because there's obviously a time lag? So, have you considered how this is going to be communicated directly to parents?
Kirsty Williams AM: We're using all of our platforms of communication to get these messages across. So, we're using the more informal methods of communication, but are relying on a systematic approach via individual directors and through to individual schools. Welsh Government already has a dedicated website page with all of the relevant information about coronavirus. We're looking, as quickly as we can, to have a frequently asked education questions page that we can update. Understandably, people are communicating to us on Twitter asking questions. It is impossible for the communications team here to be able to respond individually to every single person that is sending Facebook messages and sending tweets, so the best way we can do that is to collate the types of questions people are asking and then to be able to have a frequently updated question and answer page to try to respond to that. With regard to parents, for instance, we're aware of schools that have already sent a questionnaire out last night to parents saying,'Do you consider yourself to be a key worker? Do you work in the NHS? Please let us know by tomorrow so we can put arrangements in place for your children.'So, schools are already taking the initiative and having those conversations with parents about what their needs will be. And, as I said, Hefin, will it be perfect on Monday? No. It won't be perfect by Monday, because we're working to such constrained timescales. But we will continue to build that resilience. We also have to think about systems that look at what might the epidemic do and have systems of resilience that may work next week, given the situation we find ourselves in with public health advice at the moment. But that public health advice may change. Therefore, have we got a system that will be resilient in those circumstances? These are some of the challenges that we're having to grapple with. So, as I said, what happens on Monday might look very different to where we are if schools are still off in May. So, I hope people will understand that we are working in those kinds of scenarios.
Lynne Neagle AM: Suzy, you had a supplementary.
Suzy Davies AM: Yes, just on this question of vulnerable children, I'm just wondering how much discretion teachers are going to have in including individual children who may not be obviously under social services'care or on a risk register or whatever. Teachers know their pupils and, very sensitively, they could include people who may not be obviously in need.
Kirsty Williams AM: We would absolutely respect the professional judgment of individual headteachers to be able to have those conversations with their directors. As you said, quite rightly, they are the individuals who know their children best and know which children, perhaps, will need this extra support. We will put no constraints on those teachers trying to do that work.
Suzy Davies AM: Okay. The second part of my question is: there were going to be Easter holidays anyway, weren't there? What was going to happen about free-school-meal children during that period? Has that gone out of the window now, the normal holiday provision for children? Because that's not there normally, is it, except in separate--
Kirsty Williams AM: We do find ourselves in a strange situation. My understanding is what we're trying to work to is that we would have ongoing provision and not to make some strange,'You get this for two weeks, then you don't get it for two weeks, and then you're back in.'My understanding is, in England, that is what they're going to do. We're trying to create a system where it will be seamless and it will not necessarily matter that two of those weeks were formally holidays. It won't matter to those nurses and doctors who will need to be in work during those weeks. We're trying to create a system that will run uniformly. That's our policy goal at the moment.
Lynne Neagle AM: Helen Mary.
Helen Mary Jones AM: Just briefly, building on Suzy's question, one particular group of children and young people that I hope will be eligible to be included in the potentially vulnerable category is young carers. For some of them, they may not be able to come into school because the people they're caring for may have to be excluded because of their conditions. But I think that, for other young carers, coming to school is an absolute lifeline, because they're working at home. So, I don't know if it's appropriate for you to specifically mention those in discussions with local authorities, but it's a group of young people who, again, may not be vulnerable in other ways, but because of their caring responsibilities they may need school. And the other group--and this, I suppose, goes back to Suzy's point about teachers knowing their young people--is the children who may be living in situations where they're at risk of witnessing domestic abuse. Again, these may very well not be children who are in any formal contact with social services, but being at home may be really not a good place for them to be. So, again, I'd put in an appeal for that to be something that perhaps can be raised with schools. If a teacher is worried about what a child's circumstances are like at home, whether they can be, as you said, Kirsty, included as one of the--. They may not be formally identified, but if the teacher knows that they're at risk, or there is an instinct that they're at risk, they might be able to be included in children who are allowed to take advantage of this special provision you're making at this difficult time.
Kirsty Williams AM: We will certainly raise those issues. We have to do that in the context of what is deliverable, and we also have to do that in the context of the public health advice that we are receiving as well. One of the reasons why schools are closing is to help manage this disease. We know that the ability for school closures to make a contribution to that diminishes if we have significant children in school still. So, we will take these issues into consideration, but remembering this is part of an epidemic mitigation plan. Rob is the expert on that, not me.
Rob Orford: Yes, absolutely. This is a rapidly-evolving problem and the scale is something that we haven't seen in 100 years, and so we're having to evolve and iterate things as we go. Next week, I think, will look different to this week. So, it kind of is what it is. We've all got a role to play, and schools certainly have a significant role to play in breaking those chains of transmission. Areas that we're worried about are displacement activities. If we close the schools, then people collect at others'houses. We need to send a really clear message that you're all part of the solution, and the things that you do by distancing yourselves from your friends and your family are really important for us to get on top of this outbreak. The more that we can do that, the easier it will be when we go forward.
Helen Mary Jones AM: I'm sure that that's true, but I'm sure that we wouldn't be wanting a child who's in a very pressured environment with perhaps a very difficult relationship between mum and dad--. It may be very important for those children to be out of that for some of the time. Hopefully, we're talking about relatively small numbers, but I just--.
Kirsty Williams AM: We will look at vulnerability in a holistic way.
Lynne Neagle AM: Janet, you had a supplementary.
Janet Finch-Saunders AM: Thank you, Chair, and good morning, Minister, and your team. Can I just put on record my thanks for all that you're having to endure at this moment? I think it's fair to say you have the support of Assembly Members and, indeed, our communities. Now, the question I have: if Cylch Meithrin have to close, where will they get money from to pay their staff? Because, currently, thankfully, there's support for businesses.
Lynne Neagle AM: Janet, we're not doing Cylch Meithrin at the moment; we are sticking with schools, as we discussed in advance. Dawn.
Dawn Bowden AM: Can I just get some clarity, Steve, around what you were saying in terms of next week? Because I think the practical applications of this--and I understand that you don't know all of this yet, I understand that--the practical applications are what is coming to us, obviously, with constituents saying,'Well, what's going to happen to that?'Just so that I can be clear, are you saying that, at this stage, every headteacher will be in school on Monday, as will all their staff?
Steve Davies: Within the scope of the guidance in terms of their health, the expectation--and this will be conveyed in letters by the Minister today, to be made clear--is that they are closing for the majority of pupils, but our expectation within the guidance is that the headteacher with their staff will be coming in; for some to start the delivery of what we just described, but that will probably be small numbers, but more importantly to plan to ensure that, after the formal Easter period, which is school holidays, the schools are geared to cater for the range of pupils that we've been discussing.
Dawn Bowden AM: So, would you anticipate--again, I know this is all a bit'if and when', and it depends on the changing nature of the advice, but from what you're saying, I think we can probably anticipate that, as we go forward, there will probably be fewer schools opening and operable--that we may be moving those children on to fewer sites. Would that possibly--?
Kirsty Williams AM: That is a potential. So, we already know that one of our local authorities already has identified a strategic pattern of schools that they will want to operate in this way. That local authority has already chosen those locations, and is already having communications with how they will then staff those centres. So, that could well--. That, I expect, in the longer term, will be the nature of the provision that we will get to. But that's not for us to dictate. The local authorities are best placed to understand what is the best, pragmatic use of the resources that they have available; and of course those resources, primarily, are human beings. So, we've talked a lot this morning in the context of teaching staff, teaching assistants, but we're also having discussions with local authorities, and I met with the Council for Wales of Voluntary Youth Services this week, to look at deploying youth workers, to look to be deploying other staff that the local authority may employ, like sports development officers. There may be cultural officers that can have something to offer. Welsh Government will be talking with a range of our partners who perhaps their normal activities can't continue at the moment, but actually have personnel who want to add to this effort, who want to be able to be part of a provision going forward in the longer term, to be able to provide a great place for children to be. We want to give parents, who we are asking--. Let's think about it, in these worst of times, we're asking parents to leave their children so that they can go and do essential work, and some of that essential work is putting themselves at risk, potentially. And we want to give those parents confidence that, when they leave their child with us, that child will receive something really worthwhile, and they can direct all of their attention to doing their job.
Lynne Neagle AM: Just before you--. Janet, have you got a supplementary on schools now, not on early years settings?
Janet Finch-Saunders AM: I lost the signal before, so it's a little bit confusing at this end, so bear with me. Just in terms of the closure of schools, I have been asked by teachers what does new purpose--you may have covered it, but bear in mind [Inaudible. ]--mean in practice. And also, they're already asking what will next--? I know you said earlier that next week could look and probably will look significantly different than this week, but what can they expect to be happening next week in terms of this new purpose work?
Lynne Neagle AM: We've covered that, Janet.
Kirsty Williams AM: First of all, Janet, I just want to say thank you very much for your kind comments. That's really, really kind of you. We will be sending a letter today to clarify those positions. So, each school will receive letters today about the expectations of schools next week.
Lynne Neagle AM: I think you're having trouble hearing us, aren't you, so I think--?
Janet Finch-Saunders AM: No, I heard that loud and clear.
Lynne Neagle AM: But I think you missed the earlier comments, when we went into some detail on the new purpose of schools. So, I'm sorry about that; we are having some problems with the connection.
Janet Finch-Saunders AM: Yes, we couldn't get a signal.
Lynne Neagle AM: Dawn.
Dawn Bowden AM: Just in relation to special schools and how they will fit into this new purpose arrangement.
Kirsty Williams AM: Yes, they're absolutely central to that planning. We know, again, that some of these children are our most vulnerable and they are some of our most pressurised families. Therefore, the same situation that we've just described for maintained schools also applies to special schools. We'll be having discussions about what arrangements can be made for those children within their own usual settings. In some cases, that may not be possible. So, again, already local authorities are making different provision. Can I give a shout out to the work of Rhondda Cynon Taf in this regard, who are already doing some excellent work with regard to how they can keep in touch with their children who usually would attend their special schools. But, again, Steve can give more detail.
Steve Davies: I think special schools have already been hit by this challenge, because a significant proportion of their children, because of their conditions, have not been coming to school, they've been isolated. But the principle we've used there is, actually, even if it's a minority of children who go to those schools and are vulnerable, they deserve and need that support through the school. So, we would expect that to function with the focus on vulnerable children. But similarly, even in special schools, there will be children whose parents will be key workers, so we would expect them to apply that same principle. Just quickly in response to the earlier question, while we may bring some groups of children into separate schools, we'll have to continue with the principle of keeping social distance and any provision for a child in a special school in a different setting would be unlikely, given the nature of the special school, so we would look to cater for that within the original school.
Dawn Bowden AM: Just a couple more questions from me. It's likely, because I know it has already happened, that some schools might actually close before Monday. Some schools have already partially closed. Are you quite happy that headteachers still have the discretion to do that, if they feel that's the right thing to do?
Kirsty Williams AM: In this situation, the discretion of the head still remains. As I said, we will be communicating with all schools today about our expectations, if at all possible, to have schools open for staff to do some of this planning and to be able to respond to these priority needs that we've just talked about.
Steve Davies: The rationale of headteachers for closing schools up to now has been that they can't cope with the safety of the children. I think, moving forward, it's unlikely that that would be a rationale that headteachers would want to use for not engaging and planning for the future.
Dawn Bowden AM: We're only talking about one more day, now, anyway, aren't we? So, just in terms of confirmed cases in schools, is your view at this stage that, if there is a confirmed case in a school, once that school has been deep-cleaned, it can reopen again?
Kirsty Williams AM: If we had a confirmed case in a school, then all the usual mechanisms arranged by Public Health Wales would kick in at that point.
Dawn Bowden AM: Okay. And my final question is in relation to the position of early years and childcare settings. I know that kind of crosses over into somebody else's portfolio as well, but I think we know that. Certainly what I've seen, and I'm sure this is true elsewhere as well, we've seen nurseries closing down because the parents are actually taking the children out of those nurseries. I've got one in particular, there are kids from the ages of 6 to 12 years in there, and the parents are taking them out. They've got 30 staff there, catering for 200 children and no children to care for and the organisation, at this stage, is unable to claim on their insurance for the ongoing payment of those staff wages. Is there any advice that we can give to people in that situation at this stage?
Kirsty Williams AM: Sure. As you say, many of these settings are businesses--people's businesses and they play a hugely important role and it's a very worrying time for them. We have said that we will continue to pay for childcare, delivered under the childcare offer even when a child is unable, or a parent is unwilling, to take up that place. So, if that setting is receiving a childcare payment from the Welsh Government as part of our childcare offer, that will be paid, regardless of whether that child attends or not. And I know that we're also working with local authorities to ensure a similar position on Flying Start childcare and early education. So, that payment will be made, regardless of whether a child is attending. It's also important that childcare settings will be able to apply for the various packages of support that are being made available by my colleague, Ken Skates.
Lynne Neagle AM: Hefin, then Janet.
Hefin David AM: Yes, I'd just like to turn that around from the parents'point of view. With schools closing, there are a lot of parents then losing 10 hours of free childcare, but from a settings point of view, they'll continue to be able to receive, for the time being, the nursery care.
Kirsty Williams AM: Yes, so the decision that has been taken by my colleague, Julie Morgan, is that settings should stay open at the moment unless public health changes. That's being kept under constant review on public health. Again, the issue is that we know that that childcare is vital to many families, especially--and we're particularly concerned about those individuals who are trying to help us overcome and solve these problems. If you have any specific questions about that, we'll be happy to take them back to Julie Morgan.
Lynne Neagle AM: Janet.
Janet Finch-Saunders AM: Is this the Cylch question?
Lynne Neagle AM: Yes, please.
Janet Finch-Saunders AM: Sorry, thank you. Yes, just basically, Cylch Meithrin, there are concerns--[Interruption. ]
Lynne Neagle AM: We've lost Janet. We'll come back to her.
Kirsty Williams AM: I think if the issue is about funding for Cylch Meithrin, these are not normal circumstances. As a Welsh Government, we will take every step to provide continuity of funding, if at all possible. We will overcome this, and when we overcome this situation we find ourselves in, we will need those childcare settings, we will need those private businesses and we will need our Cylch Meithrin to be there to respond and to be able to go on doing the job that they usually do for us. And if there is any way that we can, as a Government, ensure that that happens by carrying on funding things, even if they are not able to run, all usual--[Inaudible. ]-- around service-level agreements are off. I'm not setting the precedent--let me make that absolutely clear. [Laughter. ] But, you know, we will not undermine businesses and voluntary provision like Cylch by withdrawing Welsh Government funding. I hope I've been clear.
Lynne Neagle AM: Okay, thank you for that.
Janet Finch-Saunders AM: Thank you, Kirsty.
Lynne Neagle AM: If we can move on to talk about exams, obviously you made the announcement yesterday. I completely understand that everything is a very fast-moving situation, but, as you know, there are a lot of questions that people have about young people who've put a lot of work in. Are you able to tell us any more today? In particular, have you got any idea about timescales now for setting out what the approach will be to handling the lack of summer exams?
Kirsty Williams AM: Yes, it is a devastating decision to have to have been taken, but I have done so on the very, very clear and unambiguous advice from Qualifications Wales. I met with Qualifications Wales and the WJEC yesterday. What was most important to them was that I made an early decision and I did not equivocate on what would happen for the exams. I was able to make an informal decision at that meeting, and then, of course, there is a formal process that we have to go through. That, now, allows Qualifications Wales and the exam board to operationalise that decision, and they will be communicating with schools as quickly as possible about what schools will need to do to ensure that the systems that they will now put in place can work. We are trying, as far as we can, as I understand it, to be able to mirror as closely as possible the usual results day, for instance. It might not be possible, because, of course, we're dealing with a situation that requires human beings to be involved in it, and those human beings could find themselves unwell. So, our best attempts will be to maintain the normal rhythm of an exams day in August, but that has to be caveated by the fact that we're dealing with difficult circumstances. But, the WJEC and Qualifications Wales will be making urgent communications to exam centres to explain what will need to happen next.
Lynne Neagle AM: Okay. Janet, you had a question on this.
Janet Finch-Saunders AM: Yes, I think I raised it yesterday, Kirsty, but you were receiving loads of questions. I'd just ask for some further clarification about coursework, because only 30 per cent of that is done. Years 11 and 13, typically, in my case they're what's been raised with me--do you have any advice for them?
Kirsty Williams AM: Okay, so, all exams are cancelled, but year 11 and year 13 will be given a grade--I think that's a distinction that people need to be aware of. That is because those years and those grades are gateway qualifications, and they are points of movement in the education system. So, it's really important for those students that they are not disadvantaged in any way by not being able to receive a grade that helps them to make a decision as a qualifying step into what they will do next, whether that be university, whether that be a degree apprenticeship or whether that be going into sixth form, into a college, into an apprenticeship or into some work-based learning opportunities. That's why we have to focus on those children, because for them, it is absolutely critical that we do. We are at an advantage in Wales, can I say? Because of the nature of our examination system, those students already have a lot of externally assessed work that we can use as a basis to move forward on. Because we've kept our AS-levels, we have got that data. Because we have a GCSE system--. Our year 11s, if they're doing triple science, they've already done 40 per cent of their paper, so we're very fortunate. Because of the structures that we have got in our qualification system, there is already lots and lots of externally-verified work that we can use, alongside, potentially, teacher evaluation of students as well. And I think that's really important. We're starting from a better base than simply having none of that externally-verified data. What will also be important is that these children have confidence in those qualifications, and so we will be looking at a modulated arrangement within Wales, and I know that Qualifications Wales are discussing with their counterparts across the UK a modulated system across the UK. So, actually, we can make sure that our standards are maintained by actually having that modulation across the UK. So, we know that those children never have to worry about the rigour that has gone into determining that grade. So, they can have real confidence.
Lynne Neagle AM: Okay. Helen Mary.
Helen Mary Jones AM: Thank you. A supplementary question that might feed into that moderation. You'll know that the National Union of Students has suggested that black and minority ethnic children and children from the working class, on the whole, don't do as well, in terms of their assessment by their own teachers. I don't know what their evidence is for that. We also know, of course, that boys tend to do better in exams, and girls tend to do better at coursework, for whatever reason that is. So, just to ask you at this early stage to build in those considerations around potential unconscious bias into that overall system that you're talking about. And, of course, you are right to say that, because we have got some elements of external moderation here, those factors may be less for us in Wales than they might for colleagues in England.
Kirsty Williams AM: Yes, I think we are starting at a different base, thank goodness. So, you're quite right. As I said, students will have done unit 1 papers last year if they're GCSE students. Dare I say it, some might even have done early entry. So, we still have elements of coursework that are externally verified. So, children might well have done lots of oral exams in their English and in their Welsh language. So, we have lots of pieces of work that will have been externally verified. I certainly will ensure that these concerns are passed on. I'm sure that Qualifications Wales are thinking about it. I have every confidence that they and the WJEC will come up with a very comprehensive way of establishing those grades, but I have to say, in some ways, I have to step back now, because you would not expect me, in normal circumstances, to dictate to the WJEC how much percentage goes for that, and how much percentage is allocated for that; that would not be appropriate for a Minister. My job is to make the decision on the examinations on the basis of having confidence that what can be put in place is fair and is equitable, and I have confidence that that will be the case.
Helen Mary Jones AM: Thank you.
Lynne Neagle AM: Suzy.
Suzy Davies AM: A few things from me. One is, obviously, pupils are being asked to work at home as well now, some of whom will be doing GCSE and A-level courses. So, there's just a question, generally, from me-- because we're encouraging these kids to carry on working--how that will be accommodated by Qualifications Wales, I guess, in this modulation process. It may be that your at-home work will be of a higher standard or a lower standard than a teacher would be expecting. Secondly, you mentioned the AS-levels, of course, as being of value at the moment, but we've got people in Year 12 who now won't be doing their ASs. Is there any steer at this stage about what they will be expected to do? Will they be doing two sets of exams next year, for example? Or is AS just off the table? In which case, how are the A2s going to be calculated in due course? And then, finally from me, we do have some vocational qualifications that are up for examination as well--your BTECs, and I think it's the Association of Accounting Technicians, which is a lot of computer-based learning--which is due to be examined within three weeks. Those aren't A-levels or GCSEs. I appreciate that you may not have the answer just at the moment, but are they off as well is the question, I guess?
Kirsty Williams AM: With regard to AS-levels--no final decision has been made for exactly how those students will be treated. There are a range of options that could be used, but again, we will want to be thinking about student well-being, fairness and equity in that regard, and I will update Members as soon as I have received definitive advice from Qualifications Wales around that, and that hasn't happened yet. With regard to other types of qualifications, as you will be aware, the vast majority of BTECs is a modular, continually-assessed piece of work, and we would have every expectation that BTECs will be able to be awarded, but clearly, those conversations are with awarding bodies--they tend to be UK awarding bodies, rather then necessarily our WJEC exam board--and those conversations are ongoing. But I have every expectation that those qualifications will be awarded and, of course, because of their nature there's even more evidence of continued assessment. Huw, I don't know if there's anything else that you would like to add about those types of qualifications.
Huw Morris: No. I think you've covered most of it. I don't have a definitive answer for the ATT qualification, but we can look into that and come back to you.
Suzy Davies AM: Well, I've just had a constituent ask, so that would be very helpful. And homeworking--
Kirsty Williams AM: Homeworking, right.
Suzy Davies AM: --is that going to count towards the assessments, overall assessments?
Kirsty Williams AM: Well, potentially, as I said. I don't know the exact elements. What will be absolutely necessary is that Qualifications Wales and the WJEC will be able to give absolute clarity and simplicity around how those grades will be arrived at, because parents, teachers and students will want to know that, and my expectation is on them to be able to clearly communicate what elements will and will not be taken into consideration when awarding those grades.
Suzy Davies AM: That's great. At least we covered it. Thank you, Minister--thank you, Kirsty.
Lynne Neagle AM: And, just before we move on, have the universities across the UK indicated that they are content with this approach going forward--content to accept students on this basis?
Kirsty Williams AM: Certainly. There have been discussions with universities and UCAS, of course, that this also has a bearing on. One of the--. And the views of university and how university terms might be impacted is one of the ways and one of the reasons that we've factored in to making these decisions. Those discussions with universities are ongoing, aren't they, Huw?
Huw Morris: Yes. So, we've been in regular conversation with Universities Wales and through them with Universities UK and we've received every indication that the approach that's been adopted here has been welcomed by the institutions. Those conversations will continue as we work through the practicalities of how the gradings that are awarded are going to feed through into university admissions decisions and enrolment.
Lynne Neagle AM: Okay, thank you. Well, we've got some questions now from Suzy on the potential closures of colleges and universities.
Suzy Davies AM: Okay. Well, it's a very general question, really. I appreciate you've already indicated there are lots of ongoing conversations, but my understanding is whether colleges or universities close is pretty much still at their own discretion. We're going to be asking some questions on emergency legislation shortly, which may impact on the answer you can give today, but what sort of conversations are you having with FE and HE at the moment about how they decide?
Kirsty Williams AM: Well, you're absolutely right. As we often say in this committee, universities are autonomous institutions--a status that they guard jealously and we would never want to question. Universities have been making the decision to move as much of their learning online as they possibly can and we continue to have conversations with them. Colleges are in a similar position, looking to do as much as they can to be able to provide continuity of learning via distance learning methods, and the Bill, potentially, does give us more powers of intervention in both the FE and the HE sector.
Suzy Davies AM: I might ask you about that in a minute, because I don't even know what the Bill says yet.
Kirsty Williams AM: Huw, I don't know if there's anything you want to add.
Huw Morris: No--just to confirm what's been said and also to add in that independent training providers, similarly autonomous, like colleges and universities, have been moving in the same direction. We've been very impressed with the maturity and forward-planning that's been adopted by all of those institutions and their representative bodies. We've got consistency in the approach and a common desire, and investment in moving towards online support for students.
Suzy Davies AM: And there's still this safety net idea. Certainly, colleges have indicated, as with schools, that, for the most vulnerable learners, they'll have something in place that might permit attendance on an individual basis.
Huw Morris: That's my understanding, yes, and, again, we've been in regular conversation with them about that. My understanding is that they're going to spend the next week working through the detail of how that will work for the institutions.
Suzy Davies AM: That's fair enough. And, presumably, education maintenance allowance will still be paid.
Kirsty Williams AM: Yes. Arrangements have been made to ensure that EMA continues to be paid to all students who are entitled.
Suzy Davies AM: That's right. You indicated that any Welsh Government support's going to stay, whatever the circumstances are--in your portfolio.
Kirsty Williams AM: Yes. I'm doing my best, but it's an absolute yes on the EMA. There will be no disruption to EMA.
Suzy Davies AM: Okay. You might get some further questions on HE and FE.
Lynne Neagle AM: Yes. We've got some further questions, indeed, from Helen Mary and then Hefin.
Helen Mary Jones AM: Now or in a bit?
Lynne Neagle AM: Yes.
Helen Mary Jones AM: Just further to EMA, of course, at the moment, that has an attendance qualification, doesn't it? And you don't get your EMA if you don't turn up. Should we take from your last answer that that attendance qualification doesn't apply anymore?
Kirsty Williams AM: Yes. They can't turn up if the institution is not open, and that's not their fault.
Helen Mary Jones AM: No, but that is something that's been a worry, so that's really encouraging to hear. Thinking about students in higher education, can you give an assurance that student maintenance payments will continue as normal? Is that the intention?
Kirsty Williams AM: Yes.
Helen Mary Jones AM: That's really good to hear. And have you given any special ministerial instruction to Student Finance Wales on processing applications for support or changes of circumstances, or is that something that's kind of ongoing at the moment?
Kirsty Williams AM: Those conversations are ongoing with the Student Loans Company. As I said, we anticipate no disruption to--. We don't anticipate any change in the approach to students as a result of this. Individual student circumstances could well change and our expectation would be that the Student Loans Company would respond to that. All I would say is, just to remind people: people who work for the Student Loans Company are no more able to resist this disease than anybody else. There will undoubtedly in some cases be really practical challenges to service delivery, simply because organisations could be losing staff because of illness or the need to self-isolate or because they are reacting to social-distancing messages from the Government. So, I think we just need to bear that in mind: that these organisations are doing their best, but, if they are badly affected by staff numbers being off because of the virus, then I hope people will give them due consideration.
Helen Mary Jones AM: Yes, that makes sense, of course, because we've been told that universities won't be able to entirely close, because there will be students who can't go home--
Kirsty Williams AM: It is their home.
Helen Mary Jones AM: --overseas students, for example. What discussions have you been having with the sector to make sure that those students'basic needs are met, that there's still food, shelter, whatever they need?
Kirsty Williams AM: Well, obviously, universities have a duty of care to those students that find themselves in those circumstances, and every conversation that Huw's been having would suggest that universities are well aware of their need to do that.
Huw Morris: We instituted a monitoring process very early on in the onset of the disease, not least because a number of institutions have campuses and activities in China and other parts of south-east Asia. And so, as the disease has progressed, we've seen lessons being learned from the support for students who are in isolation coming from there to the UK, and I am assured that the universities here in Wales have got processes in place that support those learners.
Helen Mary Jones AM: That's really helpful. And on this specifically--last question from me-- have you considered whether students might need to be refunded some of their tuition fees, should the academic year not be completed?
Huw Morris: So, as the institutions move more and more of their material and some of their assessment online, clearly, there are lessons that will need to be taken on board. There are established quality assurance and enhancement procedures in institutions to enable the tutors and other supporters to make sure that that material meets their needs. The intention in all of these institutions is that they will complete their course of study. There are appeals mechanisms and feedback mechanisms through the students union and through course committees and other things within institutions to make sure that any concerns or incomplete work are addressed. Failing those institutional mechanisms, there is a UK-wide system through the Office of the Independent Adjudicator for students to take forward any concerns that they have. So, we're confident that that system will be robust and will make sure that the students are getting a course of learning that meets their needs.
Lynne Neagle AM: Okay. Suzy, you had a supplementary.
Suzy Davies AM: No, Mr Morris has answered my question.
Lynne Neagle AM: Okay. We've got a couple more questions now on vulnerable learners. I've got Helen Mary, then Hefin.
Helen Mary Jones AM: I think, Chair, the Minister has already answered what the--. But thinking just a little bit more broadly about the mental health and well-being of staff and learners across a range of educational settings, or, indeed, young people who can't access educational settings, what considerations are you giving to how that mental health and well-being might be supported through what is an incredibly difficult time for everyone?
Kirsty Williams AM: Yes, that is correct. So, our expectation would be that during a prolonged period of closure--which I think, if we're honest, we have to acknowledge is what we're looking at--we would expect school staff--well-being staff, for instance in school--to be doing check-ins--phone check-ins, potentially, or FaceTime check-ins, with students, just to keep in touch with them as we go forward. We'll be looking to promote amongst young people a range of online facilities that are available--so, for instance, Meic website--so, looking to use a variety of platforms. We do, of course, have the formal NHS counselling services. I'm concerned, of course, that for some children their access to their counsellor is via their school. We know that, and we're just double checking the capacity of online counselling that already exists--online counselling tools that children already use because they don't want to go to the counsellor in the school and be seen in the school corridor going to the counsellor. They're already using those online methods and we expect to be able to continue, as far as possible, those kinds of mechanisms where children can have their mental health needs and their questions answered, and their worries. I think we have to remember that this is a really worrying time for children and young people. One of the reasons, again, that we wanted to keep schools going as long as possible--and teachers have been working so hard to do that--is because that routine of going into school and that normality is one that we've needed and wanted to maintain. Children will have worries about their own health; they'll have worries about the health of their parents and their grandparents; they will be consuming potentially media and news stories that have empty supermarket shelves. So, we need to understand, and I think we will also have to recognise, that this support will have to be ongoing once we're back to normal, and we will have to continue to look to support children in the longer term who will have lived through this experience. They are incredibly resilient, and they have been the champions of some of our public health messages. They are so much better and so much more compliant on the whole'washing your hands'and things like that than even adults have been. So, they are incredibly resilient, but we also have to recognise that it can be a really worrying time for them.
Helen Mary Jones AM: Can I just--? Just a supplementary to that--you've mentioned already, Kirsty, the importance of youth services, and, particularly thinking voluntarily youth services, you've given the commitment, when were talking about Mudiad Ysgolion Meithrin earlier, that services that are part-funded by grants through the Welsh Government, for example, thinking of the national youth voluntary service--will those be able to be maintained even if settings have had to be shut as well? Obviously, local authorities will have to make their own decisions about whether youth settings are kept open, but, in terms of the direct support from Welsh Government, can organisations that receive it rely on that through this time?
Kirsty Williams AM: No formal decision has been made, but if people are in receipt of a Government grant from my department to run a service and that service can no longer run because of the public--
Helen Mary Jones AM: Because it's not safe.
Kirsty Williams AM: --because it's not safe to do so, I do not foresee that we will be turning around and saying,'We'll have our money back, thank you very much.'Lynne Neagle AM: Okay, thank you.
Helen Mary Jones AM: That will make a lot of people happy, thank you. [Laughter. ]
Kirsty Williams AM: As I said, we are facing unprecedented circumstances. The normal rules of engagement have to change and, those organisations, we'll need them to be providing youth services for children when we are back to normal, and we wouldn't want to do anything that would undermine their ability to do that. Our call to the youth service is a call to arms, though. When we're trying to maintain services for vulnerable children and for front-line staff children, they have a valuable role to play and I know that local government and the Council for Wales of Voluntary Youth Services are already in discussion about how youth services--. Many of our youth services work on an outreach basis. Those traditional youth clubs, because of austerity, are not necessarily there anymore, so they are well used to being out and about and doing outreach work, and they will have an important part to play in the services that we talked about earlier.
Helen Mary Jones AM: Thank you.
Lynne Neagle AM: Okay, thank you. Hefin, briefly, and then we're going to take one final question from Suzy on emergency legislation.
Hefin David AM: All right. I'll declare an interest as a parent of a child with additional learning needs, although the question I'm about to ask doesn't reflect her interests. Additional learning needs pupils who are waiting outcomes of referrals--if they're currently waiting an outcome of a referral, will that process will be suspended or will it continue as normal? And, if it is suspended, will it pick up where it left off from this point?
Kirsty Williams AM: I think we have to recognise that the ability to deliver business as usual has been massively compromised. I'm sure people will try and continue to do their normal activities and their normal jobs, but that might not be possible. I will have to check that, Hefin, to be honest. I don't want to give you any false assurance if, actually, the intelligence on the ground is that that simply will not be able to happen. But we don't--
Hefin David AM: Can we have a clear line on that?
Kirsty Williams AM: We don't want to jeopardise anybody, but as I said, some of the normal services are simply not available as everybody turns their attention to trying to respond to the pandemic.
Lynne Neagle AM: Okay, thank you. Final question--because I know that the Minister's got a lot of things that she needs to get on with--from Suzy on emergency legislation.
Suzy Davies AM: I'm not going to ask you if you'll use any powers you get under the emergency legislation, but are you able to give us some indication of what they might be?
Kirsty Williams AM: Sure. For instance, the Bill will provide Welsh Ministers with powers to temporarily close schools or other educational institutions, childcare premises; powers to give temporary continuity direction--so, actually, the other way around, force things to be open--and to be able to direct resources. So, that includes, as I said, I could direct something to stay open if that institution was trying to close down. The powers also give flexibility to maybe be able to direct staff to other institutions that they would not normally work in, if that was part of our resilience needs. We'd also be looking at, for instance, relaxing requirements around ratios in childcare settings, or we might be wanting to do things around food. So, obviously, we have rules around the level of nutrition that schools should be giving their children. If there is a continuing role for schools in providing food, we might have to be a bit more flexible about what that might look like. So, those kinds of flexibilities--to be able to suspend things, direct things--that we would not normally have in normal circumstances.
Suzy Davies AM: Okay. And just to finish this one off--you may not be able to answer this one, in all fairness--in those situations where it's the Government who says'no'to various things, does that then help people in the situation of Dawn's nursery, and insurance claims suddenly become more likely?
Kirsty Williams AM: I'm not an expert on insurance, and I don't know if anybody here can help me. But what my understanding is, is that even where Government has given a direction that does not necessarily mean that you will be covered by your insurance. What we're finding in the private sector is that insurance companies are not paying out, because even when a Government has directed it, they do not regard this as a disruption to business. So, the insurance industry is not my area of expertise.
Suzy Davies AM: No, no, I accept that.
Kirsty Williams AM: It's not my area of expertise, but from what I understand from discussions around the Cabinet table, this is particularly problematic. Let me give you an example about how we've been trying to overcome some of this--it feels like an awfully long time ago now-- you'll be aware that we gave directions earlier around cancellation of school trips abroad. Trying to make sure that that direction came from the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, rather than the Department for Education was a real battle, because again there were fears that, unless that advice came from the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, insurance would not kick in, and that was a two-day discussion.
Suzy Davies AM: Okay. This is helpful to know, actually.
Kirsty Williams AM: So, these are the kinds of things that we're grappling with. But, as I said, thinking about it, that was only last week, but it feels like an aeon ago.
Suzy Davies AM: I'm not holding you to that, but it helps us manage the questions we get asked.
Kirsty Williams AM: Yes, but as I said, insurance is not my area of expertise.
Suzy Davies AM: No, but thank you for answering.
Lynne Neagle AM: Okay. Well, we've come to the end of our time. Can I thank you for attending this morning, and your officials? We do recognise what an incredibly challenging time this is, and we'd like to place on record our thanks to all of you for the work that you're doing to try and see us through this crisis. As usual, you'll be sent a transcript to check for accuracy following the meeting. Thank you again, all of you, for your attendance. Item 3, then, is a motion under Standing Order 17. 42 to resolve to exclude the public for the remainder of the meeting. Are Members content? Thank you.","Basically, the Children, Young People and Education Committee's meeting was about the current situations and policies regarding schools, students and staff during the COVID-19 pandemic. Dealing with this pandemic was extremely challenging and the government had to make decisions quickly to ensure public safety. The main concern as the education Minister was to protect all staff and pupils in schools and other educational settings. Their belief was that no child shall miss out on any education, unless absolutely necessary. From next week, schools would have a new proposal which would help support those most in need, including people involved in the immediate response to the coronavirus outbreak. The key was that they were looking at supporting and safeguarding the vulnerable and ensuring continuity of learning, which included all of those who benefited from free school meals and children with additional learning needs. What they needed to do now was to do all the work together as they were facing the continuing challenges posed by the coronavirus.",qmsum
"Why did Project Manager say that money was an important part of the project?
Project Manager: {vocalsound} Okay. Good morning everybody.
Industrial Designer: Good morning.
Project Manager: Oh, everybody is not ready.
User Interface: Uh almost.
Project Manager: Alright.
User Interface: Ready.
Project Manager: Okay, let's go. So, we're here today to to have our first kick-off meeting about uh this new project we're going to tak to talk about in a few minutes. Um so I will be uh Sebastian the Project Manager. Um you are the {disfmarker}
User Interface: I'm uh Michael. I'm the user interface designer.
Project Manager: Okay.
Marketing: Hi I'm Guillermo {gap}. I'm the Marketing Expert.
Industrial Designer: And I am Hemant, the industrial designer.
Project Manager: Okay, very good. Thanks for being here. Um so let's have a look to the the agenda. So, we are going to go through this agenda uh and mainly first to uh {vocalsound} to make {disfmarker} to to be used to the tools uh available in this nice and smart meeting room we have here. Um then we'll go to uh the plans for project and have general discussions about it. So, the goal of this project is to uh developed a new remote control. Um it should be original, trendy, and also user friendly. As usual we will follow the the project method um {vocalsound} that we are using in the {disfmarker} in our company. It is in three step as you know. First the functional design. The second's a conceptual design, and then the detailed design. During each step uh of each design we wi you will work uh s separately, individually on uh your specific tasks and will m we will meet to um to discuss and take decisions about uh what you've you've you did and what uh we will do next. So first, we have to to train ourself with all the um the tools availables in the in this nice meeting room and uh particularly the the white board so uh we are going to go through the white board and take some um s some notes or do some drawings. So who want to start? Mister {gap}.
User Interface: Ah well if no one else wants to, yeah. Okay so, want me to draw my favourite animal.
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
User Interface: {vocalsound} Let's see. Well, I don't really have a favourite animal, but um
Project Manager: You have one in mind?
User Interface: uh I think I have one in mind, so uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} I'm gonna {vocalsound} {gap} about the uh spider because you can actually draw it pretty well in the corner of a white board. The spider has a {disfmarker} spider lives in a web {vocalsound} and uh it has eight legs, and uh it can move all about the web in two dimensions. Unless it's a three dimensional web which y they have sometimes. There are some spiders that live in like {disfmarker} that have like uh kind of a a big ball of a of a web. And uh the other thing is some spiders can actually uh fly like uh they have uh they let out like uh a stream of like the web building material but it's it acts like a parachute so they can actually kind of go and find new uh {disfmarker} build a new web somewhere else. So I think they did this in uh in Charlotte's Web that movie that little uh {disfmarker} well it's actually a book first but uh um at the end all the the spiders kinda flew away.
Project Manager: Okay.
User Interface: So, that's my animal.
Project Manager: Th thank you. Very interesting. {vocalsound} Guillermo you want to?
Marketing: {vocalsound}'kay {vocalsound} I dunno why, but {vocalsound} when I was a child I I wanted to be a a panther
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
Marketing: {vocalsound} not a pink panther,
Industrial Designer: But don't you think it's very difficult to draw a panther?
Marketing: or maybe yes.
Project Manager: {vocalsound} It would be very funny for us.
Marketing: Uh yeah yeah.
Industrial Designer: So bad I don't like it. {vocalsound} {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Oh.
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Marketing: Okay it's a friendly panther.
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
User Interface: Maybe it's happy'cause it just ate someone.
Marketing: Yeah maybe {vocalsound}.
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Marketing: Um. Actually, honestly I I I dunno what's what's his it's be behaviour, I dunno if if it's the male who who hunts or it's the female uh, I I I have watched that lions di didn't hunt it's the the female lions who who hunt, so {disfmarker} but {vocalsound} I like it because it's fast, and it's black as well, so it can he {disfmarker} it can hide itself very easily and it's it's {disfmarker} it looks like um {vocalsound} powerful, strong, uh I dunno. I I watch a a film about a black panther when I was a child and {vocalsound} I was in that age when everything was shocking me a lot. {vocalsound}
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Okay. Thank you.
Marketing: Okay.
Project Manager: Hemant.
Industrial Designer: Um sure.
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
User Interface: So you don't like pink panthers? {vocalsound}
Marketing: I like it {vocalsound}.
Project Manager: {gap} {gap}
Industrial Designer: Oh yeah. Thanks. This lapel is coming out once in a while. It's not very strong. Okay. So, not the favourite animal, but I think I'll draw elephant.
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: I'll try to draw elephant {vocalsound}. It's a problem. Okay, thanks. Okay so, elephant goes like this, {gap} and then it has four feet {vocalsound}. I don't know whether there's any dist there should be any distance or not, but I think this is the easiest. And then we have it's trunk. And yep something like this {vocalsound}.
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: An eye, cute {vocalsound}.
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: Yeah, so {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Poor elephant {vocalsound}.
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} and sometimes they have a hump. It seems that uh elephants are pretty friendly and they they have one very important way {disfmarker} a different way of walking. So when they walk, wherever they are going to put their first feet, the second feet will always be. When they'll come to that position the second, the third feet will be there. That's the way they walk. And that's very peculiar about them. None of the other animals walk like this. And they are very useful to human beings. At least few few hundred years ago when there was no means of transportations or something, or when they had to carry huge um loads from one place to another, elephants were very useful. And they are found in um usually the warm countries. And um they are the biggest terrestrial animal. That's what I know about them. So, that's what I wanted to tell about elephants.
User Interface: So is this uh an Indian or an African elephant,'cause you haven't drawn the ears?
Industrial Designer: There are two kind of uh yeah, they are very different, Indian and African elephants. So Indian elephant is having one bump, I think, and the African have two. And then there's a difference in the trunk of the animals, these elephants who are Indian and {disfmarker} So at some {disfmarker} for some elephants it's {disfmarker} the trunk is having one {disfmarker} Do we have some message there?
Project Manager: Yes. We have to {disfmarker} I have to catch you,
Industrial Designer: Wind up
Project Manager: sorry. We have to to go through the meeting.
Industrial Designer: ? Okay, some other time.
User Interface: Okay.
Industrial Designer: Thank you.
Project Manager: Thank you {vocalsound}.
User Interface: We can discuss that off-line.
Project Manager: Yeah we'll discuss a f a fly or do {disfmarker} we'll do another meeting abo on elephants.
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} Thanks.
Project Manager: {vocalsound} So {vocalsound}
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: so another important part of the project is about money, uh and about {disfmarker} so about finances. So {vocalsound} we should target selling price of twenty-five Euro for this remote control and uh we have um {vocalsound} {disfmarker} which which would generate a profit of of um {vocalsound} fifty million Euros, okay. And we should target the inter an international market.
User Interface: So could I just ask one question, um is this a stand-alone unit that we're gonna be selling? So it's gonna be you already have a T_V_ but you're buying an extra remote control for it or something?
Project Manager: O this is the {vocalsound} next topic we have to discuss exactly,
User Interface: Okay, alright.
Project Manager: so let's go to it. So um we should decide which kind of remote control we want to uh we want to uh we want to go. Should be should should it be um specific remote control to some specific device? Should it be a universal one? And uh etcetera. So um {vocalsound} so I'm waiting for your for your inputs very quickly because we have only three three minutes to go.
User Interface: Okay well, so, it seems the the first thing that they've kinda specified is the price like based on how much profit we wanna make, which seems to {disfmarker} a kind of a little strange if we don't know what the the product is yet, but I guess if that's {disfmarker} if that's the requirement that we need to to design the the product to actually fit that that price bracket so, I guess we're gonna need to find out what's actually {disfmarker} you know, what people ar are willing to pay for {disfmarker} um what kind of product they're expecting for twenty-five Euro
Project Manager: Okay.
User Interface: because it seems quite a lot for a remote control,
Project Manager: Okay I think this is more a job to our
User Interface: so it's {disfmarker}
Project Manager: market person yeah.
Industrial Designer: Marketing person.
User Interface: Yeah.
Project Manager: So it should be the topic of maybe of the next meeting just to to have an overview of this and uh in which direction we should go.
Industrial Designer: Mm-hmm.
Project Manager: So we need to close the meeting. Uh we'll have a new meeting soon and uh so {gap} the work every every of you ha have t d to do. So um you have to work on the on the working design, you have to uh work on the technical functions, and uh you have to work on us user requirements specs, alright?
Marketing: Yeah.
Project Manager: Um you will receive some information by emails, i as usual. Thanks for coming today.
User Interface: Okay.
Project Manager: Thanks.
Industrial Designer: Thanks.
User Interface: Alright.","User Interface asked a question that whether it would be a stand-alone unit that they are going to be selling. So Project Manager answered that they should decide which kind of remote control they want to go, if it should be a specific remote control to some specific device, or if it should be a universal one. User Interface responded that they need to design the product to fit the expecting twenty-five Euro based on the requirement. Project Manager agreed and invited group mates to input ideas in the next meeting.",qmsum
"Summarize the whole meeting.
Industrial Designer: {gap}.
User Interface: Hello {vocalsound}.'Kay.
Project Manager: You all saw the newsflash?
Industrial Designer: It's {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Or you got the same message?
Marketing: Yeah I I just saw it one minute ago.
Project Manager: {vocalsound} Yeah sorry.
Industrial Designer: I don't know.
Marketing: When I uh {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: I didn't see it yet I think.
User Interface: Newsflash? D did I miss something?
Marketing: {vocalsound} Yeah.
Project Manager: Yeah. Yeah I received an email so I thought I I can't mail you so I thought I'd just drop it in the folder, but {disfmarker}
Marketing: Yeah pretty much.
Industrial Designer: Hey what's wrong with my computer?
User Interface: Okay.
Project Manager: Is it unlocked?
User Interface: No.
Industrial Designer: {gap}.
Marketing: Mm. Yeah that's my presentation. {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Woah. I uh kind of opened it {gap}.
User Interface: Mm.
Industrial Designer: Huh?
Marketing: Mm?
Project Manager: Uh {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: What the {disfmarker}
Marketing: Oh right.
User Interface: I think you have to uh change your desktop uh
Project Manager: Okay.
Marketing: {vocalsound}
User Interface: size.
Marketing: Ooh. {vocalsound}
Project Manager:'Kay. Everybody ready?
Industrial Designer: Not really.
Marketing: Well {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Sorry.
Project Manager: No no no. Yes yes yes.
User Interface: {gap} computer is uh not functioning?
Marketing: Alright.
Project Manager: {vocalsound} Okay.
Industrial Designer: Okay. Where do I find this? I'm not so g display huh?
User Interface: Uh display.
Marketing: {vocalsound}
User Interface: And then uh settings?
Industrial Designer: Appearance?
Marketing: Huh.
User Interface: Mm I'm not sure I {gap}.
Marketing: {vocalsound} You read the newsflash? {vocalsound}
Project Manager:'Kay. Can we get started
User Interface: No.
Industrial Designer: No what was it about?
Marketing: Hmm.
Project Manager: or is there some pressing issue?
Industrial Designer: Yeah my computer is not functioning properly.
Project Manager: Oh no pressing.
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: {vocalsound} Did you plug in the power cable when you come back?
Industrial Designer: Yeah yeah. No but my screen is reduced in size. {vocalsound}
Project Manager: {vocalsound} Yeah. That's difficult. Yeah.
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Marketing: What? {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: Feedback.
Marketing: Hmm.
User Interface: Okay.
Project Manager: {vocalsound}

Project Manager: {vocalsound} Yeah.
User Interface: {vocalsound} Format. {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Format save.
Marketing: {gap}. So it doesn't draw the attention away.
Project Manager: Yeah.
Industrial Designer: This is dreadful.
User Interface: I made uh uh my own map.
Project Manager: Oh yeah sure.
Industrial Designer: No not this, but the task.
User Interface: It's a {disfmarker}
Project Manager: You have Playstation also?
User Interface: Yeah.
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} Yeah. {vocalsound} No that's okay. No I just flapped it, closed it, took it here and then this happened. Ah. Uh {disfmarker} where was it? In settings? Okay. Alright. Thank you.
Project Manager: Huh.
Industrial Designer: Do you guys like your tasks?
User Interface: Yeah.
Marketing: Yeah. {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: I spent a lot of time thinking about what I was gonna do and then a couple of minutes before this I get my function you know the information that I need.
User Interface: Yeah wa wa you actually {disfmarker} Yeah. But it it's not clear what you have to to to type uh type in your presentation.
Industrial Designer: So frustrating.
Marketing: Yeah.
Industrial Designer: So {disfmarker}
Marketing: Yeah. I I had a whole idea and then just was typing it and then oh. I have to do that so switch.
Industrial Designer: Yeah {disfmarker} Yeah exactly. This presentation is mainly based on my own ideas'cause I hadn't time to intergrate tha the information yet so {disfmarker}
User Interface: Yeah.
Marketing: Mm.
Industrial Designer: Really annoying.
Project Manager: Okay. So there we are again.
Marketing: By your humble P_M_.
Project Manager: Yeah.
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Okay this is the agenda. Um we have three presentations, I heard.
Marketing: {vocalsound}
User Interface: Really. {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Yeah really. {vocalsound} So who wants to start?
Marketing: Yeah that's fine {gap}.
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
Marketing: We have to start it right away? {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Yeah. Uh this is you?
Marketing: Functional? Yeah functional requirements.
Project Manager:'Kay.
Marketing: Alright. I'm gonna talk about functional requirements. Um {disfmarker} Well uh some research has be done uh has been done. Uh observing of one hundred uh subjects in the usability lab using a remote control. Uh and they also filled in a questionnaire. The findings were um, well you can see them for yourself. They disliked the look-and-feel of current remotes controls. {vocalsound} Users think they're ugly. Um {vocalsound} they do not match the the operating behaviour of the users. So they they d they don't match what they want to have on it. Um {vocalsound} they are often lost somewhere in the room. Um it takes too much time to learn how to use a new remote control. And they're bad for R_S_I_. {vocalsound} I don't know uh how a user can reach that but okay. Um {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: Ts
Marketing: there is also uh was also some research on uh the most relevant and and and irrelevant uh f functions. Uh most irrelevant and less used were audio settings, mono, stereo, uh pitch, bass. Um screen settings for brightness and colour and stuff like that. Um but they are used. I mean the {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: So they do need to be in the {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Yeah.
Marketing: Yeah they do need to be on the on the remote control.
Industrial Designer: Alright.
Marketing: I mean if you can't control the the sound settings {disfmarker} I mean if you dislike a very uh loud bass or something, you you need to change that.
Project Manager: {vocalsound} {gap} often.
Marketing: So um yeah we have to.
Industrial Designer: By the way my T_V_ doesn't have an equ equaliser but
Marketing: We c we c Yeah I mean w we can't {disfmarker}
Project Manager: {vocalsound} Next generation does. {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: {disfmarker} okay.
Marketing: my my T_V_ has,
Industrial Designer: No. {vocalsound} Alright.
Marketing: but we we can leave them uh away. Uh most relevant, uh most used functions, uh they speak for themselves I guess. Uh power button, uh channel, volume selection. Uh teletext but we can skip that because I saw the newsflash, and teletext is so outdated that it it's i should not be used uh any more in the future.
Project Manager: N not used anymore.
Marketing: So forget this one.
User Interface: Okay.
Marketing: Uh channel settings, so for programming uh your channels in in the right order.
Project Manager: Yeah.
Industrial Designer: By the way where did you guys get that newsflash from?
User Interface: Yeah. {vocalsound} I was wondering uh {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: I didn't get anything.
Marketing: Yeah, {vocalsound} on on the project uh {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Yeah. Not by mail. I receiv the mail but you don't. So {disfmarker}
User Interface: But you you've got more information than {disfmarker} uh.
Marketing: No so it's a text file n in the project folder. So teletext can be skipped.
Project Manager: That's in the presentation, so {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Alright.
Marketing: Um there was some research on new features in a remote control. Uh about an L_C_D_ screen uh and speech recognition. Well we got an update for the for the audience. Or the the the targeted group. So it's above forty I guess.
Project Manager: Uh below I believe.
Marketing: The new product? Or below {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Yeah below forty.
Marketing: because that's pretty relevant.
Project Manager: Mm-hmm.
Marketing: I thought I read a {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Our current customers are in the age group forty plus.
Marketing: Yeah?
Project Manager: And the new product should reach new markets, which is the customers below forty.
Marketing: Below? Okay well {vocalsound}
User Interface: But where did you get uh that information?
Project Manager: That's in a newsflash.
Marketing: that's that's in the newsfla
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
User Interface: Okay. {vocalsound}
Marketing: okay that's a good to know. Um because you see see a clear distinction between the age groups, concerning the features.
User Interface: Yeah.
Marketing: I mean uh above forty people are not so interested uh not so interested in a screen or speech recognition. Uh but below that age they uh they pretty much are. So I think we can build that in. Um {disfmarker} Yeah well we can skip this part as well, because I thought I read above forty so we could skip the features, but we just have to build them in because uh they find it very interesting. Um well we have to keep all the classic functions but make the buttons as user-friendly as possible. Um and and also there's {disfmarker} so not only the design of the bus uh buttons but o how you can push them, and stuff like that. So the physical uh aspect of it. Um {disfmarker} And I think {disfmarker} and certainly for for the for the lower age groups, uh nice design, which uh does not make the remote control {gap} in your room.
User Interface: Yeah.
Marketing: It's it's actually a part of your interior, of of your design in your room. So it's {vocalsound} the people can say, well what's that, well that's my remote control, so it's d it has to look nice and feel nice, and and have all the functions that uh {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Yeah. But it also needs to have corporate identity.
Marketing: Yeah so the the logo has to be
Project Manager: Present and the colours.
Marketing: uh present yeah, and the colours as well.
Project Manager: {vocalsound} So we can't change much of that.
Industrial Designer: Do we have {disfmarker} uh yeah {gap}.
Marketing: Yeah so but I I don't think that's that's a problem because the thing has to have a colour anyway, and most of the times there is a brand present on it.
Project Manager: Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah.
Marketing: So I think that's not gonna gonna affect it very uh very much.
Project Manager: Okay.
Marketing: Well that are the the consequences uh on a marketing uh part.
Project Manager: {vocalsound}'Kay.
Industrial Designer: Alright.
Marketing: Yes.
User Interface: Okay.
Project Manager: It's open already so you can use {gap} to
Marketing: {gap}.
Project Manager: find yours.
User Interface: Mm. It's {disfmarker}
Project Manager: F_ five.
User Interface: F_ five. Okay.
Project Manager: {vocalsound} Go Jurgen.
User Interface: Oh. What is this?
Marketing: {vocalsound}
User Interface: Oh no. {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
User Interface: How do I uh {disfmarker}
Project Manager: {vocalsound} You pressed alt F_ four? {vocalsound}
User Interface: No no no. I pressed the mouse button.
Project Manager: Oh great. {vocalsound}
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: It's {disfmarker} th that's the self-destruct button.
Project Manager: {vocalsound} Yeah.
User Interface: Yeah. Okay.
Project Manager: Uh maybe you can do it from your computer so talk us through it.
User Interface: Okay. Um if you all go stand around uh {disfmarker}
Marketing: Yeah. Just {disfmarker} yeah.
Project Manager: Yeah. {vocalsound}
User Interface: Computer {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Alright.
Marketing: Sure.
User Interface: Um {disfmarker} {vocalsound}
Project Manager: That's nice. {vocalsound}
User Interface: No.
Project Manager: F_ five. Yeah.
Marketing: Yeah.
User Interface: Okay.
Marketing: Alright.
User Interface: I uh had uh two examples.
Project Manager: Mm-hmm.
User Interface: Um this one is the the yeah the advanced one with a lot of options and functions and buttons.
Project Manager: Mm-hmm.
User Interface: This the easy one
Marketing: Yeah.
User Interface: I think we have to to combine them. And uh yeah merge the best functions of all examples.
Project Manager: Mm-hmm.
Marketing: Yeah.
Industrial Designer: Mm-hmm.
Project Manager: Yeah.
User Interface: Um but yeah the the age is uh under forty?
Project Manager: The mm yeah.
Marketing: Yeah and and and marketing research stated that that that kind of users are not afraid of of a lot of functions.
User Interface: So we {disfmarker} Okay so so we have the option for more functions.
Marketing: So not not too much but {disfmarker} yeah.
User Interface: Um {disfmarker} yeah.
Industrial Designer: And we do have to integrate the screen and the the speech {disfmarker}
Marketing: And the speech recognition yeah.
Project Manager: {vocalsound} Yeah.
User Interface: Yeah.
Industrial Designer: alright.
User Interface: Uh yeah this this one we can remove for kids. It's just only for adults so uh we can uh use some advanced options. But {disfmarker}
Marketing: Yeah from age of sixteen so yeah.
User Interface: Yeah but I prefer we we uh use the the basic options uh yeah. We have to to make them very easy so for just uh zapping around the channels you can just push one button.
Marketing: Mm.
Industrial Designer: Mm-hmm.
Project Manager: Mm-hmm.
User Interface: But if you want to to use your your video recorder or something else, you should use use an uh an advanced option.
Marketing: Yeah but uh the the newsflash also stated that it should control only one device, only your television.
User Interface: Okay one device.
Project Manager: Yeah. So n it's very easy.
User Interface: Okay. I didn't see {gap}.
Marketing: So w
Project Manager: Now yeah it's okay.
User Interface: {vocalsound} Okay and I also uh yeah. W yeah.
Marketing: So there are not extra options in this case, but uh {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Okay.
User Interface: We have to make it fashionable. Like you uh said uh before.
Project Manager: Yeah.
Marketing: Yeah.
User Interface: Uh yeah the basic functions. Um yeah only use a extra function if they are really needed.
Project Manager: Yeah so maybe you can hide them or something.
Marketing: Yeah.
User Interface: Yeah.
Marketing: Yeah well what what we can do with the screen is is all the the configuration options, you can put that in the screen.
Project Manager: Yeah you make a screen menu or something.
Marketing: And the and the {disfmarker} yeah screen menu to to to uh to do that,
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
User Interface: Yeah.
Marketing: and then the basic function just on the device itself.
Project Manager: Mm-hmm.
Marketing: So it looks very simple and all the advanced features are hidden in the screen, uh with a clear menu.
Project Manager: Yeah and the other oth other uh functionality is the screen.
User Interface: Yeah.
Project Manager: What does the screen do?
User Interface: {vocalsound} Did I uh {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Alright.
Marketing: Uh. {vocalsound} What are {disfmarker} wh
Project Manager: Yeah. It's low power.
User Interface: did I break it? {vocalsound}
Marketing: What {gap}.
Project Manager: So what does the screen do? They said they needed it but what does it do? What do they want with the screen?
User Interface: For for the advanced functions I think.
Project Manager: Yeah that's what we make it up.
Marketing: Yeah well it {gap} yeah it didn't
Project Manager: So but what did the marketing {disfmarker}
Marketing: it didn't say what they want to do with the screen.
Project Manager: No.
Marketing: Well I, my guess is it's it's pretty handy for advanced uh advanced functions.
Project Manager: Yeah okay it's handy. With no predefined uh {disfmarker}
User Interface: Like searching for channels and {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Ah look.
Marketing: Yeah searching for channels, programming them.
User Interface: Yeah.
Industrial Designer: We have your uh {disfmarker} oh never mind. {vocalsound}
Project Manager: We're back online. {vocalsound}
User Interface: Okay. That's uh {disfmarker} I'm al I'm almost finished so {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Okay. {vocalsound}
User Interface: {vocalsound} Um the {disfmarker} we have to to to watch out for the {disfmarker} i if we make it f very fashionable, it it the functional functionality will go down. So we have to make uh a compromise between functionality and fashional fashionable
Project Manager: Mm-hmm. Content and form.
User Interface: yeah content and form.
Industrial Designer: {gap}.
Marketing: Yeah.
Project Manager: Yeah.
User Interface: {vocalsound} Now that that was uh was the end.
Project Manager: {vocalsound} That was the end. Okay.
User Interface: Yes.
Industrial Designer: Okay.
Marketing: Yeah.
Industrial Designer: Well my presentation is a bit uh sucky. {vocalsound}
Marketing: {vocalsound} Well you can improvise right?
Project Manager: Uh which one is it? Technical functions?
Industrial Designer: Yeah a little bit.
Project Manager: This one?
Industrial Designer: Uh no. No no. {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Functional requirements?
Industrial Designer: Yeah I think that would be it then. {gap}
Project Manager: No.
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: You didn't put it in? Or {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: I have no idea.
Marketing: So we we can go for {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: That w {gap}.
Project Manager: {gap} it's not really English. {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: Let me check. I know.
Project Manager: Uh kick off. Oh working design I got it.
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
Marketing: So we can go for the look-and-feel of the the left example, and then a screen on top of it.
Project Manager: Here you go.
Industrial Designer: Alright how do I uh skip pages?
Project Manager: Just uh press uh {disfmarker} yeah. Yeah.
Industrial Designer: The keys yeah?
Marketing: Yeah.
Industrial Designer: Alright. Um yeah well I was working on this before I got my information. So I was just working off the top of my head and using my colin common knowledge about uh remote controls.
Project Manager: Mm-hmm.
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: And well the info on the website which came too late.
Project Manager: Mm-hmm.
Industrial Designer: Um so I didn't really know what kind of functions we had to put into it yet.
Project Manager: Mm-hmm.
Industrial Designer: So uh uh this is basically an overview of what we discussed in our last uh meeting. Those were my uh starting points.
Project Manager: Mm-hmm.
Industrial Designer: Uh I was working on a s yeah on a schedule, and I was supposed to do it like this. But um yeah then uh the information came and it was kind of exact with all the steps in the remote control that I had to follow, so I was trying to organise them for myself.
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Mm.
Industrial Designer: And then make the
Project Manager: Design yeah.
Industrial Designer: the design, a the actual design,
Marketing: Design? Yeah.
Industrial Designer: but I never came around to do that. So I'm not really sure what I'm supposed to say about it.
Marketing: Okay.
Industrial Designer: I mean everything speaks for itself I guess. Mean you press a button um {vocalsound} the it tru goes, it sends a signal to a chip,
Project Manager: Mm-hmm.
Industrial Designer: which uh translates it into infrared signal of certin spatial frequencies.
Project Manager: Mm-hmm.
Marketing: Yeah frequency. Yeah.
Industrial Designer: And uh or temporal fr frequencies actually. And then uh through a uh transformer, it the signal gets boosted and then sent to the to the receiver on the T_V_
Project Manager: Yeah decoder.
Industrial Designer: and the T_V_ will translate it into a function. Um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Yeah well this was actually {vocalsound} all I got around to do.
Project Manager: {vocalsound} Blank. Yeah okay.
User Interface: {vocalsound} Yeah.
Marketing: {vocalsound} Yeah.
Industrial Designer: I mean I dunno if I'm too slow for this stuff, but uh {disfmarker}
Project Manager: {vocalsound} Work harder.
Marketing: {vocalsound}
User Interface: Okay shou should we make a list of the of all the functions we want uh {disfmarker}
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: Yeah. Whatever.
Project Manager: Yeah. Uh {disfmarker}
Marketing: Yeah we want to incorporate in uh into it.
User Interface: Yeah.
Project Manager:'Kay. Um for those that didn't see yet um the basic new requirements of the management were no teletext, only for T_V_. Uh it should be designed for a use g uh group below forty, but I don't think it's w wrong if we can uh target the current customer group as well.
Marketing: Mm.
Project Manager: And uh the corporate identity should be clear in the design of the remote control. And we have to decide on the functions, and on the, let's see what was it, uh the target group. We have to make be clear what that is.
Marketing: {gap} group of users, or {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Yeah users.
Marketing: because it says below forty I mean. {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Yeah so I think it's easy but {disfmarker}
Marketing: I guess that's that's the tar yeah uh or male and female {disfmarker}
User Interface: But uh it's it's also for children or just uh {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Yeah it's below forty so we can decide where to {disfmarker}
Marketing: Uh six {disfmarker} the marketing research started on s on the age of sixteen.
User Interface: Okay. Okay.
Marketing: Sixteen to twenty five, twenty five to thirty five, thirty five to forty five, something like that.
Project Manager: Okay. So below forty is okay.
Marketing: So um {disfmarker}
Project Manager: But we need an {disfmarker} lower level which to s uh focus.
Marketing: How do you mean?
Project Manager: So is it from sixteen to forty? Is it from twenty to forty? Is it from thirty?
Marketing: Uh sixteen to forty.
Project Manager: Yeah?'Kay.
User Interface: Yeah. We we have to {disfmarker}
Marketing: Well I I guess people of sixteen are are quite used to technology.
Project Manager: Yeah.
Marketing: So they they adapt to it pretty soon I guess.
User Interface: And if we have a larger public we have uh yeah more options to to uh sell our product.
Marketing: Yeah.
Industrial Designer: Yeah so what we might wanna do is uh yeah cust I have customised the screen functions, if you know what I mean.
Project Manager: Mm-hmm.
Industrial Designer: The uh younger users are more acquainted with these kind of machines so they can use more advanced functions. But maybe elderly people don't understand it so well, so they need a simpler remote.
Project Manager: Design. Mm.
Industrial Designer: And yeah that you can choose what the design displays, or wha whatever.
User Interface: Yeah that's that's why uh I wanted to to make yeah two uh different uh yeah groups of functions. The the simple functions for for the the whole public, and the the advanced options for the younger people yeah who are more yeah experienced with uh {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
Project Manager: Mm-hmm. {vocalsound} And maybe y
Industrial Designer: Experienced yeah.
Marketing: But uh all incorporated in the screen or or just on the remote itself?
User Interface: Na I w I should uh put uh the the yeah the extra advanced options on the onto the onscreen display.
Marketing: Yeah
Project Manager: Yeah.
Marketing: like like you have a visual of the of the brightness with with a kind of sliding bar and a bus and and stuff like that for sound and and vis and and visuals?
Project Manager: Yeah.
User Interface: Yeah.
Project Manager: Yeah. So is {disfmarker} you should have a menu for all the the functions you don't use regular and which are {disfmarker}
Marketing: Uh you can make a {disfmarker} if you make a drawing.
User Interface: Yeah.
Project Manager: Yeah. Aye yeah.
Marketing: Uh {disfmarker} Uh {gap}.
Project Manager: Shall I uh {disfmarker}
Marketing: Uh black's okay. {vocalsound} And draw it very big.
Project Manager: Yeah. It's okay.
Marketing: Oh. {vocalsound} Yeah.
Project Manager: {gap} no, it doesn't have line control, so {disfmarker}
Marketing: Yeah. {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Yeah we get the {disfmarker} {vocalsound}
Marketing: {vocalsound} Yeah well, this is basically uh it's {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: The remote?
Project Manager: The remote, yeah?
Marketing: alright the remote? Um well usually the power button is on top I guess.
Project Manager: Basic. Is on top. Which should be easy, easily reached with the thumb.
Marketing: Yeah so it should fit right in into your hand.
User Interface: Yeah. L left top or right uh top?
Project Manager: T I s should said right.
Marketing: Right. Right.
User Interface: Yeah, right.
Industrial Designer: Right top.
Marketing: I most people are right-handed so {vocalsound}
User Interface: Okay.
Industrial Designer: Yeah definitely.
Marketing: maybe left-handed special addition, but okay.
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Marketing: If you put it like like here. Or something. I dunno. Um then you could put a screen, like on a mobile phone, also on top I guess.
Project Manager: Mm-hmm.
User Interface: Yeah but if you are using the the normal functions, the the basic functions, you normally press them on the u yeah.
Project Manager: Do the also with the thumb. So it should be a little bit longer so that you can put your uh thumb, also reach the middle. Or you should screen at the bottom and then you can see it very clearly.
Marketing: Okay so y yeah you have you have it in your hand, and the screen is below, and the buttons are in the middle.
Project Manager: You you need to be able to hold it so {disfmarker}
User Interface: Yeah.
Project Manager: Yeah.
Marketing: Okay for example {vocalsound} if you put the screen here, it's more about the functions now than the than the layout.
Project Manager: Yeah okay that's true. Layout. That's for the {disfmarker}
Marketing: Doesn't work too well. It's uh it's bent.
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: I can't help it. {vocalsound}
Marketing: {gap}.
User Interface: You broke it. {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Yeah. {vocalsound}
Marketing: Yeah.
Industrial Designer: {gap}.
Project Manager: Man. {vocalsound}
Marketing: {vocalsound} Right.
Project Manager: Yeah okay. {vocalsound}
Marketing: Okay you get it. Uh for example if y if you put all the {disfmarker}
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
Marketing: {vocalsound} Right.
Project Manager: {vocalsound} You want the normal piece of paper? And you have a pen?
Marketing: Yeah.
Industrial Designer: And might be easier huh?
Marketing: Maybe this. {gap} kind of works.
Project Manager: Yeah?
Marketing: Like if you have like uh ten buttons for for all the for all the channels,
Project Manager: Mm-hmm. Uh.
Marketing: um and here one for for
Project Manager: And the for flipping up and down.
User Interface: Yeah yeah. And volume control.
Marketing: Yeah that that usually uh {disfmarker} like here, here, here, here.
Industrial Designer: Yeah I {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Yeah.
User Interface: Yeah.
Marketing: So you have up and down for the for the channels, and left and right for the volume uh {disfmarker}
Project Manager: And left to right. And those can also be used for the menu.
Industrial Designer: Yeah exactly. I thought {disfmarker} but this is really your department, that we need just the functional display and four cursors.
Marketing: Yeah.
Project Manager: Yeah.
Marketing: Yeah.
Project Manager: Yeah okay but this is function so if you can use them for multiple things {disfmarker}
Marketing: And you you have {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: And {disfmarker}
Marketing: most of the time you have one button in the middle. It says menu,
Industrial Designer: Yeah okay.
Project Manager: For the menu. Yeah.
Marketing: and then if you press it you {disfmarker} the screen gets activated and then you can use these buttons to scroll up and down and left and right to go into functon
Project Manager: Mm-hmm.
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
Marketing: and then just {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Yeah.
Marketing: mo most of the time this menu button is also like okay, to to confirm a a kind of action.
Project Manager: Yeah.
Marketing: So you scroll into it, okay. You select a function like v like uh bass. You just adjust it with these two buttons.
Project Manager: Yeah.
Marketing: Then okay to confirm, and then uh on on each on each screen there's there should be an option to go back to a to a upper level.
Industrial Designer: Mm-hmm.
Marketing: And then finally say okay, exit. Or or one button to exit it.
User Interface: Yeah.
Marketing: Uh in one time I dunno, that's not really my department.
User Interface: {vocalsound} And do we need a a logo on our uh remote control, or {disfmarker}
Marketing: {vocalsound} That's more your uh your department to to uh to {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Yeah.
Marketing: Yeah. But it should be {disfmarker} if the screen is here then the logo should be like on on top,
User Interface: On the left uh top yeah.
Marketing: yeah. I mean it's uh {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Yeah but that depends on where you put the screen.
User Interface: Okay.
Project Manager: But it's essential that there is a screen.
Marketing: Yeah. Yeah I mean the position of the screen is also more essential than {disfmarker} I mean we we look where we have space left and then put the logo over there.
Project Manager: Yeah. And for the speech uh recognition part, if we want to incorporate that, we need a microphone.
Marketing: But um {disfmarker} Yeah so it should be {disfmarker} I mean if you have it in your hand here, should be on top somewhere, maybe.
Project Manager: Yeah. This would be uh {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Why did we wanna put the display in the bottom?
Marketing: I mean i
Project Manager: No that's not s sure so {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Okay.
Marketing: That's not sure
Project Manager: uh we need a display.
Marketing: but it's {disfmarker}
User Interface: Yeah may maybe because you're {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Because yeah if you use the functions your hand will block the display.
User Interface: Yeah okay but {gap} only for the basic functi if you're going to use the advanced option, you're going to press the the menu button and then {disfmarker} yeah.
Marketing: Yeah I mean a screen on top looks more lo logical to me.
Industrial Designer: Normal for logical t
Project Manager: Yeah.
User Interface: Yeah.
Marketing: Also because people use m mobile phones and they also have the screen on top.
Project Manager: Yeah they're used to it.
User Interface: Okay the {disfmarker} yeah. That's possible.
Marketing: So you you just have to reach a little bit for the power button.
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
Marketing: I mean if you grab it.
Industrial Designer: On once it's on it's on. You don't need the power button.
Marketing: But most most of the times if a if if a T_V_'s on standby people just press a channel to put it on.
User Interface: Yeah, okay. Okay we put it on top.
Marketing: So we put this on top, and then make the corporate logo
User Interface: Yeah.
Marketing: like over here. R_R_. And j and the microphone, I mean it can be very small. If you look at your mobile phones {gap} are some stripes, {vocalsound} little little holes.
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
Project Manager: Mm-hmm.
Industrial Designer: Maybe on the top or even on the side.
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
Marketing: Yeah maybe on the side. I mean if the if the microphone is good.
Project Manager: Yeah but then it's possible that you cover it with your hand so {disfmarker}
User Interface: Yeah.
Industrial Designer: True.
Marketing: Yeah okay. So on the on the top is better.
Project Manager: I think that top is the best option.
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} But if you uh if you hold the ma the remote like this, if you put it on the top on the side {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Yeah okay.
Industrial Designer: I dunno. Should be able to work.
Marketing: Yeah. {gap}.
Project Manager: Depends on the sensitivity of the microphone, but I think that's okay.
Industrial Designer: Never mind. Can we leave this up to you? {vocalsound}
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Marketing: Yeah it doesn't matter that much. So {disfmarker} but um the screen is on top? Which functions did we have left? I mean this is basically numbers, volume, uh channel up and down.
Project Manager: Volume. Up. Channel up and down, and the control of the advanced options.
Marketing: Screen is over there.
Project Manager: So maybe it, we should decide what advanced options we want to put in the L_C_D_ screen.
User Interface: Yeah. If we {disfmarker}
Marketing: Yeah. Yeah. That's uh that's a good one.
Industrial Designer: Yeah so we we needed to integrate the sound and uh and image options right?
Project Manager: Yeah so sounds?
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} Like uh bass uh {disfmarker}
Marketing: Yeah. Sound?
Industrial Designer: so we need kind of an equaliser. If you {disfmarker}
Marketing: Yeah. Equaliser. So if you have sound {disfmarker} But not too advanced. I mean most T_V_s use only treble and bass.
Project Manager: Yeah
User Interface: Yeah it it's just a remote control so {disfmarker}
Project Manager: and they're {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Yeah treble, middl middle, bass or something.
Project Manager: They're not used often so {disfmarker}
User Interface: Yeah.
Marketing: Yeah. It's uh pretty hard to write.
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: Ah as {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Yeah just {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: {gap}.
Marketing: {vocalsound} Mm. Okay but you have sound?
Project Manager: Yeah sounds.
Marketing: Yeah just {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Yeah.
Marketing: oh y you have digital uh {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: {gap}.
Marketing: better write it down over there yeah.
Project Manager: Of course. I'm just a {vocalsound} secretary.
Marketing: So you have sound.
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Marketing: Yeah.
Project Manager: {vocalsound} Coffee?
Marketing: {vocalsound} Uh yeah sound and then within sound I guess treble and bass?
Industrial Designer: Yes please.
Project Manager: Treble bass.
Industrial Designer: {gap} the mono stereo option?
Marketing: Yeah. Also.
Project Manager: Uh {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: And there there was something else also.
Project Manager: Pitch I believe, yeah.
Industrial Designer: And then pitch.
Marketing: Pitch. Yeah. But pitch, isn't that {disfmarker} yeah that's the the height of the tone.
Project Manager: Yeah.
Industrial Designer: The fr yeah the frequency of the tones, yeah.
Marketing: Yeah okay,
Project Manager: Yeah and mono stereo.
Marketing: wh why would you use that?
Industrial Designer: Yeah isn't that that depends on the on the signal of the of what program you're watching.
Marketing: If people like talk like uh {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Mm.
Marketing: Yeah.
Project Manager: And also the tuning part?
Marketing: Programming part.
Project Manager: Yeah programming. So channel programming?
Marketing: Uh so we have sound, yeah? Channel programming.
Industrial Designer: And yeah in the functionality of the
User Interface: Television uh itself uh {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: no no of the remote uh do do we want uh the buttons to make sound when you press them? As a confirmation or whatever you know?
User Interface: Mm.
Marketing: Mm.
Project Manager: Mm.
Industrial Designer: I dunno.
Marketing: I think it g it gets annoying.
Project Manager: Yeah.
Marketing: I mean most mobile phones used that in the beginning but {disfmarker}
User Interface: We we could make an option for it, but uh you can disable s
Industrial Designer: Under the a yeah advanced option menu you can put those things.
User Interface: Yeah. But uh the the television itself has also the the options {gap} brightness and uh screen colour etcetera. So {disfmarker}
Marketing: Yeah.
Project Manager: Contrast yeah.
User Interface: yeah.
Marketing: Yeah but people don't want to sit on their knees on their knees in front of their television with {gap} only three buttons then it's very hard to
Project Manager: Mm. No. Uh, so contrast,
Marketing: y yeah contrast and brightness?
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
Project Manager: bright,
Marketing: Yeah those are the most used I guess. If you look at your monitor.
Project Manager: uh {disfmarker} And the others were in your presentation right? So I can just copy those?
Marketing: Well {vocalsound} yeah well I guess that these were the only ones, I guess.
Project Manager: Okay. {vocalsound} It's easy. {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: But so we have we have T_V_ options, which is all this.
Marketing: Yeah. I will look it up.
Project Manager: Yeah the button options and the L_C_D_ options.
Industrial Designer: The sound, sound and image. And you have in that uh the indeed the remote control options.
Project Manager: Indeed.
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: {vocalsound} Yeah.
Industrial Designer: So we need two menus kind of thing.
Project Manager: Yeah you have basically a button menu, which you can use directly, uh according to the old principle.
Industrial Designer: Uh-huh.
Project Manager: And the L_C_D_ options are activated by some some software options, thats communicates with the infrared uh decoder yeah.
Marketing: Yeah with the chip and then {gap} I mean {disfmarker}
Project Manager: {vocalsound} So you {disfmarker} You have an additional processor and and software part.
Marketing: Uh {disfmarker} yeah. Well {disfmarker} yeah we have power button, whether that's present.
Project Manager: Compared to o
Industrial Designer: Alright.
Project Manager: Mm-hmm.
Marketing: Channel volume selection present. Uh numbers present. Yeah a audio settings, mono, stereo, pitch, bass, treble. Screen settings, brightness and colour.
Project Manager: L_ s Yeah. Colour. Yeah I I call it contrast.
Marketing: Yeah con contrast is {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Yeah I make it c colour.
Marketing: Yeah okay, colour and brightness.
Project Manager: Yeah.
Marketing: Um and what you say, channel settings or channel programming? So you you have an option to to start scanning all the frequencies, and when it encounters one, well it shows on your T_V_. And then you can um {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Yeah and automatically um {disfmarker} Mm-hmm. {vocalsound}
Marketing: Uh and then you can select uh a number in your remote on which you want to save it.
Project Manager: Yeah so I've g channel program is autoseek?
Marketing: Yeah, autoseek.
Project Manager: {vocalsound} Uh name a channel, or {disfmarker}
Marketing: Well most T_V_s automatically display the name, which they get through the cable.
Project Manager: Oh they get automatic names, okay.
Marketing: Yeah. So you only have to choose the position on your
Project Manager: {gap}.
Marketing: It only has to match the the channel frequency on your T_V_, with with the with the position on your T_V_ and and so your remote.
Project Manager: Yeah. Yeah but can you also say I want f uh Veronica on the channel number uh five or {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Help.
Marketing: If you already programmed it.
Project Manager: Yeah.
Marketing: If you want to move it. Yeah that should be possible too.
Project Manager: Yeah. How do you call that? {vocalsound}
Marketing: Yeah how do you call that? Mm? Wait you you should be able to to browse through a list or something, which w displays all the all the values, all the channels which are possible.
Project Manager: Channels? Yeah.
Marketing: I mean like one to f thirty of or ninety or whatever.
Project Manager: Ninety nine or something. Yeah.
Marketing: Just browse through it and then um in some kind of way see if it if it if it is programmed.
Project Manager: S swap channels? Can I call it that?
Marketing: Yeah. Swap channels.
Project Manager: Swap's good option. Okay. Uh other functions?
Marketing: So you {disfmarker} most of the time if you if you swap it {disfmarker} S uh let's say for example you have uh R_T_L_ five on on channel five. And Veronica on channel eight and you want to move Veronica to channel five, most of the times you override the previous uh the previous one.
Project Manager: Mm-hmm. {vocalsound} Okay. Well that's's up to uh Mister User Interface Designer.
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Marketing: Yeah. It's it's pretty uh {disfmarker}
User Interface: Okay.
Marketing: yeah I mean you have to look on on the menu
Industrial Designer: {gap} working design. Doch.
Project Manager: {vocalsound} Also.
Marketing: on the T_V_.
Project Manager: That's {disfmarker} you're {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} He only has to figure out how it has to look.
Project Manager: {vocalsound} Yeah but also, which buttons you have to press to get a certain result?
Industrial Designer: And how
User Interface: Yeah.
Industrial Designer: to use {disfmarker}
Project Manager: And the working design was to specify how ph the physical interation between the components was, as I believe.
Industrial Designer: Yeah okay. But {disfmarker} You did your homework. But um {disfmarker} yeah. Okay.
Marketing: Yeah.
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
Marketing: {vocalsound} Or or is it too hard to to ju to just do it all on your remote? To programme the channels?
Project Manager: No I don't think so.
Industrial Designer: No no. It should be able to do any remote.
User Interface: No that's {disfmarker}
Marketing: Uh.
Project Manager: But I think the communication with the television is difficult. But that's not our part.
Marketing: Yeah.
Project Manager: We don't have to design a protocol so {disfmarker}
Marketing: No.
Industrial Designer: No.
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
Marketing: That's true. That's true.
Industrial Designer: Thank god.
User Interface: Okay {disfmarker}
Marketing: Yeah. So we have a figure a figure out a way to to do that easily. I mean th the autoseek is is not a problem.
Project Manager: No that's the {disfmarker}
Marketing: I mean you uh you uh current channel and then then it just says, uh on which number do you want to save this, and you just press a number on your remote, and then say confirm, okay, and then it's it's saved. It's easier, {gap} it's it's it's harder to, if you have already programmed it, to to swap.
Project Manager: Yeah. So but {disfmarker}
Marketing: So we have to think of something for that.
Project Manager: Um {disfmarker} The User Interface Designer can design a menu for all these function I put them on the {vocalsound} {disfmarker}
Marketing: Yeah k kind of structure into layers.
User Interface: On the uh yeah can you i make a a map with with all the {disfmarker} yeah'cause it's now {disfmarker} there are lots and lots of documents
Project Manager: {gap}. Yeah. Yeah I can.
User Interface: and {disfmarker}
Project Manager: I'll just try to reorganise uh things. Um {disfmarker}
Marketing: So {disfmarker}
Project Manager: So you design the basic function menu for the L_C_D_ screen? Uh um {disfmarker} I think {vocalsound}
Marketing: And and the layout of of the thing itself.
Project Manager: th I think the yeah the layout of the screen
User Interface: The the layout of the remote control?
Project Manager: and I think you can concentrate more on the button placement and the placement of the uh screen itself on the {disfmarker}
Marketing: {gap}.
User Interface: Isn't that more the the u uh the user interface part?
Project Manager: {gap}. No I d I think that's more in {disfmarker} {gap}.
Industrial Designer: Uh all the functional uh aspects of the remote I think are in my department.
Marketing: Maybe more on {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Yeah.
User Interface: Yeah.
Industrial Designer: I have to know what it has to do, so if you wanna you know the changing the channels kind of s thing is, I have to integrate that in the design.
Project Manager: Okay. So he's layout and you're function.
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
Project Manager: Form function okay. {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: I think that's a that's a good separation.
Marketing: Okay.
User Interface: But do I have to to uh to yeah to make the the menu layout also? Or {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Yeah.
User Interface: Are you going to do that?
Industrial Designer: Mm.
Marketing: Yeah. Yeah I guess so.
User Interface: Yeah? I I'm going to make {disfmarker}
Project Manager: I think i that's your department yes,
User Interface: yeah o okay.
Project Manager: because w he already knows what {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Yeah we have to kind of work together.
Marketing: Yeah.
Project Manager: Yeah.
User Interface: Yeah.
Industrial Designer: If if I make the the the yeah the menu like, I have to state which function has to be in the menu,
Project Manager: But we're not allowed. {vocalsound}
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: and then you have to decide, it's, in a in a way that b is user-friendly.
User Interface: Yeah. Okay. Y you you are going to make a list of what functions are uh are going to to be on the the screen, the menu screen.
Project Manager: Yeah.
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
User Interface: And I'm going to make a a nice menu uh with with {gap} pages and yeah.
Marketing: Yeah.
Project Manager: Yeah.
Industrial Designer: I think {disfmarker} yeah.
Marketing: With with some l with some layers in it.
Project Manager: Yeah and also make clear which buttons to press to get certain result,
Marketing: So some menus.
Project Manager: because that's always the difficulty.
Marketing: Yeah.
Project Manager: Every device has its own {disfmarker}
User Interface: Yeah.
Marketing: Yeah. Well I guess this this button, the the the okay,
Project Manager: Menu okay.
Marketing: menu okay. Or you can incorporate two uh difference uh different buttons. Uh like uh for your mobile phone. Um so this is only for to get in the menu, or to exit it.
Project Manager: Mm.
Marketing: And then one to confirm, and one to go one step back.
Project Manager: Back. Yeah.
Marketing: So it's like the the save button on your your mobile phone, if you have a Nokia or like that. Or the or the no button.
Industrial Designer: Mm-hmm.
Marketing: To go one step back you {gap} it's only two extra buttons,
User Interface: Yeah. W we {disfmarker}
Marketing: but if it if it's very clear that they are for the screen {disfmarker}
User Interface: Uh I think we have to to group, to make two groups. Um the {disfmarker} one group for the for the display, and one group for the basic functions, and {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
Project Manager: Yeah but they're incorporated {gap}? Up and down is {disfmarker}
User Interface: Yeah okay but we we have a m
Marketing: Yeah because this this is used for both.
User Interface: yeah but maybe that's that's not uh {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Smart?
User Interface: yeah if you're if you're z zapping uh with your uh yeah remote control, you can press the the menu button, and then you are suddenly into the the yeah the display.
Marketing: Into your screen. Okay. So you
Industrial Designer: You wanna separate uh {vocalsound}
Marketing: l should leave the menu button out of here.
User Interface: Yeah.
Marketing: And {gap} and just put it under the screen, the screen {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Put it on top.
User Interface: Yeah j just just group group the {disfmarker} yeah we make these the advanced functions and these the basic functions.
Project Manager: Mm-hmm.
User Interface: So we make a yeah a line between them.
Marketing: Yeah. But we should place the screen on top, right?
Project Manager: Well {disfmarker}
User Interface: F oh yeah. Okay yeah we swap uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Okay.
Project Manager: But that's uh J Jurgen's department.
Marketing: Yeah.
User Interface: Yeah. So we make it a {disfmarker}
Marketing: Yeah. You just you just find out and {gap}.
Project Manager: You just make the layout. You {disfmarker}
User Interface: Okay.
Project Manager: do we do the extra two buttons or not?
User Interface: Uh {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: I think you should.
Project Manager: Yeah.
Industrial Designer: It's easier. If you put too many functions in one button it gets confusing.
Project Manager: Yeah okay. That's true.
Marketing: Yeah.
User Interface: Yeah. So we have a a menu button and a s
Project Manager: And to, okay and back, also.
User Interface: Okay. Okay and back button.
Marketing: Yeah. Yeah, or confirm and back. Whatever.
Project Manager: And of course the four arrows.
Marketing: Yeah.
Industrial Designer: No.
Project Manager: But those are still y doubly used. Both the L_C_D_ {disfmarker}
Marketing: Should we save this picture, or or you know what it looks like?
User Interface: Yeah I'm I'm not s clear about uh the the extra two buttons. We have a menu button and {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Yeah.
Marketing: Yeah. That that just to to activate the screen. So {disfmarker}
User Interface: That's the the one with the {disfmarker} yeah okay.
Project Manager: Menu button access the menu in the L_C_D_ screen.
Marketing: And then with these buttons, woa, y you navigate.
Project Manager: You can navigate.
User Interface: Okay.
Project Manager: But you can also navigate the channels. And the volume.
User Interface: Okay so that that's not uh {disfmarker} Yeah that {disfmarker} Those are
Project Manager: Those are both both {disfmarker}
User Interface: multifunctional.
Project Manager: yeah.
Industrial Designer: Hey is it interesting for users if we put LED lights under the buttons? So that if you uh press on the menu function that only the buttons that are used for the menu are ligh li light up.
Marketing: Yeah. L l litten up yeah.
User Interface: Yeah.
Project Manager: Oh five minutes.
Marketing: That's very good idea.
Industrial Designer: N
Marketing: Alright.
Project Manager: Light uh {disfmarker}
Marketing: Yeah that's a good idea because then it becomes clear which buttons are active now, which you can use.
Industrial Designer: Yeah and then it's also easier to integrate several functions in one button.
Project Manager: Yeah sure.
User Interface: Yeah.
Project Manager: Okay.
Marketing: Yeah.
Project Manager: Um {disfmarker}
Marketing: So {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Anything else?
Marketing: Those buttons are are lit up.
Industrial Designer: I think not.
Marketing: But just one thing. Should we use those two? Them? Or only this to to scroll?
Project Manager: I've {disfmarker}
Marketing: And then use the two functional buttons to confirm, to go into something? Oh no we have to use this to adjust some some bars?
Project Manager: Volume.
User Interface: Yeah. {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: Yeah keep it optional'cause maybe you can you know go left to right and up and down in a in one menu.
Marketing: Yeah. And maybe we should use this also as an okay button, still. And then just only a back button.
Project Manager: Well we have those buttons. We use all four.
User Interface: No {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: The pr the problem with the okay button in the middle is, sorry
Project Manager: Yeah okay go ahead.
Marketing: Yeah?
Industrial Designer: sorry, uh is uh if you're pressing up and down, you can easily press the okay once you, when you're not already at your choice.
User Interface: Yeah. So maybe make one uh one okay button and and one navigation button.
Marketing: Yeah.
Project Manager: Yeah that was already decided.
Marketing: And one back.
User Interface: Yeah the with with the the channel and the volume uh {disfmarker} yeah m a multifunctional navigation button.
Project Manager: Okay that's what we decided earlier on.
User Interface: Yeah okay. Yeah.
Project Manager: Right okay. So {disfmarker}
Marketing: Yeah.
Industrial Designer: You wanna close down huh? {vocalsound}
Project Manager: yeah I wanna close down.
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: I have to, sorry.
Marketing: Yeah.
Project Manager: it's not because I don't like you but {disfmarker}
Marketing: Yeah.
Industrial Designer: That's okay.
Project Manager: yh we have lunch break,
Industrial Designer: Already.
Project Manager: and then we can work for thirty minutes, and I have to write very fast to make the minich min minutes. And then uh we'll see {disfmarker}
Marketing: Yeah.
Industrial Designer: Alright. How m how long is the lunchbreak?
Project Manager: I don't know. Nobody told me. {vocalsound}
Marketing: We have to ask. {vocalsound}
User Interface: But do we have to write uh to write down uh the our stuff now? Or first lunchbreak?
Industrial Designer: Okay.
Project Manager: No I th believe there's first lunch break.
User Interface: Because I {disfmarker} I've everything in my head now {vocalsound} so {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Yeah. Or you can just {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Mm.
User Interface: Okay.
Project Manager: Yeah?
User Interface: Yeah.
Project Manager:'Kay.
Marketing: Yes.
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: I think you can put uh the laptop back in the room and {disfmarker}
User Interface:'Kay.
Industrial Designer: This is {disfmarker}
User Interface: Yeah.
Marketing: Yeah.
User Interface: Yes sir. {vocalsound}
Marketing: Time pressure.
Project Manager: {vocalsound}'Kay. Yeah it's a lot of pressure.
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: Yeah. Sorry for my uh not finished presentation uh.
Project Manager: That's okay. Oh yeah. {vocalsound}
User Interface: Oh no no. {vocalsound}
Marketing: Yeah we'll kick your ass later. No. {vocalsound} Uh.
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} Bring it on.
Project Manager: I don't know if it works but it should be saved.
Marketing: Aye {disfmarker} Y you saved it? Does it save automatically in the project folder? Or {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Yeah. It's uh {disfmarker}
Marketing: Okay. We'll see.
Project Manager: Should be here. Smart board.
Marketing: Just put back my laptop.
Project Manager: Don't know if you can use it but {disfmarker}
Marketing: Alright.
User Interface: Okay.
Marketing: Yeah you can open it with the picture preview or stuff like that.
User Interface: And uh we have to make uh some maps with uh with the all the the data we uh gathered.
Project Manager: Yeah. I try to organise it by these three.
User Interface: {vocalsound} {gap}. It's it's just my own map so I put everything into the {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Yeah {gap} yeah yeah.
Marketing: {vocalsound} {vocalsound}
Project Manager: I don't really mind. I just put the minutes here and we'll see.
User Interface: But you got some extra information uh {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Yeah that's in the functional design uh folder.
User Interface: Okay.
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Yeah. Yeah that's just basically what I just showed.
User Interface: But where do you did you get the newsflash?
Project Manager: Yeah. Yeah I got it by {disfmarker}
User Interface: You're the only one uh {disfmarker} okay.
Project Manager: yeah. I'm gonna get kicked if I don't do it so {disfmarker} {vocalsound}
Marketing: {gap} internet.
User Interface: Okay.
Industrial Designer: Alright.
Marketing: Alright.
User Interface: Yeah.
Project Manager: {vocalsound} Make me proud.
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} I'll try to.
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: So first we have a lunchbreak now?
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Yeah.
Industrial Designer: Alright.
Project Manager: I believe so. {gap} just ask. {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: Mm-hmm. I dunno where she {gap}.","The whole meeting was about what the group should do for the remote control, from a good-looking appearance to a joyful user experience. At the beginning, the group had individual presentations about their previous research findings. Through those presentations, all of the four got a general idea about the target market, the functions and the layout. They talked about the functions carefully as well as the interface design of the remote control later on. Finally, under the leadership of the Project Manager, all the members got some assignments for their next detailed design.",qmsum
"Summarize the specific questions and answers on the impact on education.
Lynne Neagle AM: Okay. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to the Children, Young People and Education Committee. We've received apologies for absence from Suzy Davies and Jack Sargeant and I'm very pleased to welcome Jayne Bryant back, who is substituting for Jack today. Are there any declarations of interest from Members, please? No. Okay, thank you. Item 2, then, this morning, is our sixth scrutiny session on the Children (Abolition of Defence of Reasonable Punishment) (Wales) Bill. I'm very pleased to welcome our witnesses this morning: Sally Jenkins, who is chair of All Wales Heads of Children's Services and is here representing the Association of Directors of Social Services; Alastair Birch, who is senior system leader for equalities and safeguarding at Pembrokeshire County Council, who is here representing the Association of Directors of Education Wales; and Councillor Huw David, who is the Welsh Local Government Association spokesperson for health and social care and leader of Bridgend County Borough Council. So, thank you all for attending this morning. We're very pleased to have you here. We've got a lot of ground to cover, so, if you're happy, we'll go straight into questions and I'll start just by asking about your general support for the Bill, which is outlined in the evidence. Can you just explain why you think the current law is ineffective or unclear?
Alastair Birch: Bore da--bore da, bawb. So, I'm Alastair Birch. The statement, really, from ADEW is that the rights of the child should be educated and achieved, really, under the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child. The current legislation has been criticised, obviously, by the UN concerning the defence of reasonable punishment still being within our current legislation. So, we will always--ADEW will always--advocate that the rights of the child be upheld, so that is really the fundamental aspect in terms of the statement from ADEW, and the position of ADEW is that the rights of the child are fundamental in this process. And there are certain articles--. I know that the Rights of Children and Young Persons (Wales) Measure 2011 made sure that article 3 and article 4, article 12 and article 37 were a focus in terms of making sure that the best interests of the child were put first, that children expressing their views and opinions was a priority. And we know, for safeguarding purposes, that the express opinions of the child and the voice of the child are a fundamental aspect of any safe environment, whether it be a school or college. So, that is--the position is really following that legal position under the Rights of Children and Young Persons (Wales) Measure.
Lynne Neagle AM: Okay, thank you. Nothing to add at this stage, no?
Sally Jenkins: I'll just add, on behalf of ADSS and on behalf of children's services and social services more widely, for us, this is not a change in our position, this is not new; this is a position that we, on behalf of the leaders of social services across Wales, have taken over many years, going back 20,25 years. I think what we would say is that we really welcome this Bill and we welcome the proposed change for the clarity it would bring--the clarity that it would bring for children, for parents and for professionals. I think what we would recognise is that this is a very little-used piece of legislation, so it's rare, it's not as if this is something that is going to cast great change across the scene for children and families in Wales, but what it will do is represent a change in the reality of how we care and nurture our children. I would echo absolutely what Alastair has said in terms of the rights of the child, but equally, in terms of all of our policies in Wales in terms of promoting well-being for children, this has to be key. So, for us, this is about a natural progression of change in how we care for our children in Wales. For children's services at the very sharp end of this world, for us, it brings a true clarity. This continues with an ambiguity in how we treat our children and how we care for our children, and the shift for us brings that very much needed clarity.
Lynne Neagle AM: Okay, thank you. The committee has already heard different views about whether there's clear evidence that physical punishment is harmful to children. What evidence does the work of social services provide about whether physical punishment is actually harmful?
Sally Jenkins: Obviously, what you'll all be aware of is that, as part of the consultation for this Bill, the Public Policy Institute did a further piece of research to look at the impact of physical punishment on children. A number of things that we know--we know from across the world that the evidence is that introducing legislation or changing legislation in this way improves children's positions within their families. What we know is that children themselves, as Alastair has already referred to, really find physical punishment demeaning and harmful, and for children it is an emotionally damaging experience. Now, there may be disagreement about that, there will be different views on that, but that's the voice of the child in this debate. The voice of the child is very clear that physical punishment is for them harmful. I think what we would also say is that, in the world that we work in, it's part of a continuum, and, whilst this is an element of how children are cared for, what we see is a continuum where an acceptance of how we treat children in a particular way perpetuates throughout our work. By changing this, it helps that shift to that absolute recognition that our children must be cared for in a way that is physically safe in all dimensions for them.
Lynne Neagle AM: Okay, thank you. We've had evidence from the equal protection network that the reasonable punishment defence undermines child protection and fails to protect children because it permits an arbitrary level of violence, which invades children's physical integrity, making it a potential pathway to more serious physical or sexual abuse, and you did refer to that just now. Is there anything you want to add on that?
Sally Jenkins: I would echo that. I think there is something in this that is about our culture, about how we see our children. It is about how we see our smallest and most vulnerable people, and if it is acceptable it opens the door to those other, more extreme versions of violence, which then complicates the issue for us. This is about clarity, and, whilst there is an argument that this is a small episode for a child, it's not a small episode for a child, it is a major episode for a child, and I think absolutely, as you said, the potential for it then to lead on, and over gradation and time to increase the risk for children, is clearly there.
Lynne Neagle AM: Okay, thank you. The final question from me: your written evidence emphasises the need for greater clarity around the definition of what constitutes corporal punishment, but that contrasts with what we've been told by the children's commissioner and the equal protection network, who've emphasised the importance of simplicity in the Bill. How do you respond to that view, and is what you're calling for essential to be on the face of the Bill?
Sally Jenkins: It's not essential for it to be on the face of the Bill. What we would like to see is discussion within the implementation phase for that nuancing. Absolutely agree in terms of simplicity--I think that is really important--and I've already mentioned clarity. What we don't want to do is further confuse the position. We know that the legislation in different countries has done that, and there are ways that you can do it, but what we would welcome is an opportunity during the implementation phase for discussion.
Lynne Neagle AM: Okay. Thank you.
Huw David: And, as a principle, obviously we would welcome full involvement, and we know there's the commitment from Welsh Government to full involvement in the implementation, because, as with every piece of legislation, implementation is the most important part, and we would want to ensure there is that commitment to a major awareness-raising campaign, and there is that from Welsh Government, because we need to take families, carers and parents with us on this. Also we need to ensure that there is that support available to parents and carers that do sometimes struggle with parenting, and that needs to be a universal offer across Wales. If we're to progress with this, that has to be an option that is offered to every parent in Wales.
Lynne Neagle AM: Okay. Thank you.
Sally Jenkins: Local authorities have already been very heavily involved in terms of looking at this Bill and exploring what the issues are and the discussions and looking at what the implications from a local authority perspective will be, as Huw describes, both in terms of the awareness raising, early support and intervention and prevention services for families against the backdrop of the current issues that we have in local government, but also awareness raising--because absolutely it is key that families come with us on this journey. This is not an imposition. This is embracing a culture and a value system for our children.
Lynne Neagle AM: Okay, thank you. I've got some questions now from Dawn Bowden on the implementation of the Bill.
Dawn Bowden AM: Thank you, Chair. So, you've pre-empted me, Huw.
Huw David: Right. Sorry. I've got good eyesight; I can't see--. [Laughter. ]
Dawn Bowden AM: You've already said, obviously, that you're looking towards working with Welsh Government in terms of its implementation. What's been your role so far in terms of the implementation of the Bill--local authorities generally, now? Have you had a role? Has Welsh Government been involving you in discussions around the introduction of the Bill so far?
Huw David: Yes. So, obviously we were consulted--a key consultee--but also our officials have worked very closely with Welsh Government officials to make sure this is implemented successfully, if it is progressed.
Sally Jenkins: Our involvement with this, from a social services perspective, goes back over two years, directly in working towards this point, never mind the history in terms of work towards this area. But, very directly in relation to this Bill, we were first involved at least two years ago, to recollect, and that was in a series of workshops with other agencies, for example Children and Family Court Advisory and Support Service Cymru and the police, and looking in real depth at what the implications would be for us as agencies to look at what the likely trajectory would be in terms of our pathways for referral into our services and what that might mean for us. And then particularly, for example, with CAFCASS Cymru in relation to private law, what the fallout might be, and then what, if anything--and that's the discussion that we need to have--that could mean for children's services in particular, given the pressures that we're already under. So, we've been in constant, I suppose, involvement in terms of the Bill already, as part of the consultation, in terms of the focus groups and in terms of direct work with Welsh Government officials to take this forward. And we are absolutely committed to continuing with that work.
Dawn Bowden AM: Okay. You touched there on the pressures that you're already under, which we fully appreciate, but you also mentioned in answers to Lynne Neagle earlier on that you welcomed the Bill in terms of its clarity. So, are you confident that the Bill can be implemented without any major impact on your capacity to deal with it?
Sally Jenkins: We've done--. A number of local authorities--my own included, Newport City Council, has done some work to look at what the likely impact would be and then actually to look at what some of that costing would need to be. Further work is needed on that area, and that needs to be carried out during the implementation phase. I think what we've done is we've looked internationally at what the impact has been elsewhere when similar legislation has been introduced to try and gauge, but that's difficult to do in terms of comparable nations and size and also different systems. And obviously our approach in terms of children and pedagogy is very different from some of the nations that have already done this. I wouldn't like to say one way or the other, because I think, in terms of that culture shift, it could be a double impact on us in terms of increased referrals because of increased awareness, but it could also be, I suppose, as Huw alludes to, that, if we're looking at ensuring greater awareness of preventative services and support services for parents, actually people coming to the fore and asking us for those services as well. So, at this stage, I think what we would want to say is that we continue to be fully involved in the implementation phase, to look at what the cost implications for that could be, and not just for the local authorities but also the police, CAFCASS Cymru, for third sector organisations involved in preventative services. I don't think any of that should undermine the position in terms of children and their rights within our society. So, a difficult answer, in the sense that--
Dawn Bowden AM: No, I understand. What you're saying is that this is a piece of legislation that, in your view, is a good piece of legislation. It's setting out to, hopefully, achieve what the purpose of it is and you will deliver what you need to. Can I ask you whether, then, you've also given thought to the impact on--we've talked about social services, but the impact on other services, like housing, education and so on? You're obviously coming at it from slightly different angles in other sections.
Alastair Birch: We are part of the universal service for children, and we very much work in co-operation with the WLGA and our social care colleagues, and we've been part of that consultation. In terms of education, the main changes, or adaptations, would be around training and awareness. And, in terms of the Bill, there needs to be the clarity--ambiguity would be bad--in terms of making sure that safeguarding leads within all schools have the right training and support. So, really, that's the key element there, and then obviously the preventative services for the parents that schools can signpost, and sometimes possibly even host, in terms of being community schools. These positive parenting approaches that--. I have colleagues who have worked in that area for many years and see the benefits in how those positive parenting approaches make a difference to families.
Dawn Bowden AM: So, from your point of view, it's awareness raising, is it?
Alastair Birch: It's awareness raising; it's making sure that professionals are fully briefed on necessary changes, that there's very little ambiguity, that we are aware that--. We still have that duty to report whenever there is any safeguarding concern. That'll still be part of the all-Wales child protection procedures. That won't change, and that duty is always going to be there for all our professionals. But that awareness raising and training will be the key, and then, obviously, working in co-operation with our colleagues.
Dawn Bowden AM: Okay, I understand that. Have you been given an indication of how long you've got between Royal Assent and implementation, and whether you've thought through any of the key milestones that need to be implemented?
Sally Jenkins: There's a group proposed that would be a strategic leadership group in the steering group that we're part of, which is now laying out what would happen after Royal Assent if that is given. So, we will work towards that.
Dawn Bowden AM: Okay. My final question, Chair, is about some of the responses we've had to this committee that say that the state should not get involved in family life--I'm sure you've heard those views--unless it's in the most serious circumstances. To what extent do you think that this Bill undermines the existing local authority responsibilities, or don't you?
Huw David: The state's paramount role is to protect children from harm. That is our legal responsibility, it's our moral responsibility, and we will discharge that. And there is obviously a view--it's a view that is enshrined in the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child--that physical punishment, physical harm to a child is harm to a child, and we should be preventing that and act to prevent that. That would be the position of the Welsh Local Government Association, and we also respect the mandate that Members of the National Assembly for Wales have too. And we believe that children can be raised by parents without recourse to physical punishment, effectively, and we'd support parents in that. We do not believe that in the 50 nations across the world where such legislation exists that the state is interfering in family life unnecessarily. We believe this action reflects a cultural change, a sea change that's taken place in Wales over the last 30 to 40 years, where the vast majority of parents now say that they do not use it themselves, they do not support it, and we believe this is actually a reflection of what has happened in Welsh society. We support Assembly Members in the view that the natural progression of that is that children's rights are protected across Wales.
Dawn Bowden AM: So, I've got largely positive feedback from you in terms of the Bill and its intentions, and so on. Do you foresee any unintended consequences for this Bill?
Huw David: If we implement it carefully, if we implement it with the right resources, then I hope not. I think not. But as with every piece of legislation, it is about the implementation, it is about the cultural change as well, and that's why I cannot overstress the importance of making sure that resources are made available, because our social services departments--children's social services in particular--are overstretched. They are at breaking point--make no bones about it--and they are dealing with children who are facing serious harm and neglect. We are having record numbers of contacts from police, from teachers, from doctors and, of course, from children themselves who are experiencing that harm and neglect. And obviously, we want to focus our energy and our attention on those children. Equally, though, we don't want to lose sight of those families and children that are experiencing significant problems, but who we want to support through our early intervention and prevention programmes, and that is why it is important that there is investment in those programmes, so that children do not end up in that terrible position where we have to, for their safety, take them from their birth families to protect them. And the reality is, in Wales, that we are doing that to more children than we've done for a long time, and the numbers are growing across Wales. And that is only because of the most appalling neglect and abuse, because there is no way that any judge would permit us to act to make a child safe if it was not for that fact, and the facts are there. So, I don't want that focus to be lost, but, of course, we welcome and understand the need to progress this piece of legislation.
Dawn Bowden AM: That rise that you talk about here, is that due to more interventions, greater awareness, more incidents? I'm trying to link this to the Bill in terms of whether the Bill is actually going to give you more work to do in those areas.
Sally Jenkins: On the reasons for the rise in the numbers of looked-after children in Wales, which are higher than those in England, and also the numbers of contacts that we have across the local authorities, the work of the care crisis review, which was completed last year; the work of Isabelle Trowler, who's the chief social worker in England; countless research and reports that have taken place in the last 18 months; and currently the public law working group, under the auspices of the president of the family court, would all indicate that it's multifactorial. So, what you have is a range of reasons that have led to the increasing numbers of children becoming looked after across England and Wales. What you can't do is identify a single reason. There have been headlines that have said,'Is it increased austerity?'That is clearly a part of this. Is it in Wales an increased awareness of adverse childhood experiences and the emphasis of the impact on children of, for example, domestic abuse? Is it because of our understanding of what happens to children in those households? All of that research would say it's all of those things. And then, when you also add in changes in our practice with our colleagues in the judiciary, changes in our police service, but also changes in our preventative services, you've got that whole range of elements. And there is going on across the local authorities and Welsh Government a huge amount of work to try to address and understand that, and then to ameliorate that. Children who need to be in care for safety need to be in care, but what we have to do is get to a point where fewer children come into care and we're able to protect them, firstly, and secondly where those children who are in care are cared for in a way that delivers the best possible outcomes for them. So, there is no simple answer unfortunately. I think, in terms of this Bill and unintended consequences, I agree absolutely with everything that Huw has said. My job is around children at that far end, but what this Bill does is it brings clarity. It brings a clarity even for those children at that very far end. It takes away even that point of discussion that this could possibly be okay, and I think that's important to hang on to.
Dawn Bowden AM: Thank you, Chair. Sorry.
Alastair Birch: One unintended consequences is that I think that there will be an increased focus on the UNCRC. And, in terms of children having a discussion around this point, children need to be part of that discussion. It's something that affects them. And a key aspect of education is the voice of the child. It has become significantly--. It's changed completely in the last 10 years, and it is one of the key things in terms of us driving improvements.
Dawn Bowden AM: Would that be something that you would be looking to do in schools?
Alastair Birch: Anything that improves the voice of the child in any educational context is good and it's very powerful for the children. And it improves their educational experiences, encouraging the opportunities for them to discuss the issues, the adverse childhood experiences that they encounter, which are significant, and it's our educational professionals that are facing this day-in, day-out. They've become a very highly trained workforce, they're ACE aware, they're trauma aware, and anything that focuses, even increases, their professionalism and understanding around a particular point, and also--. So it's a positive unintended consequence, shall we say, that it could reinvigorate some of the voice of the child discussion within various contexts.
Dawn Bowden AM: Okay. Thank you, Chair.
Lynne Neagle AM: We've got some specific questions now on implementation for social services, from Janet Finch-Saunders.
Janet Finch-Saunders AM: Thank you, Chair. If this Bill becomes law, would you encourage members of the public to contact social services departments if they do see a child being smacked?
Sally Jenkins: We already encourage members of the public to contact social services or the police, depending on the circumstances. Interestingly, I'm picking--
Janet Finch-Saunders AM: What, if a child is being smacked now?
Sally Jenkins: Yes. If a child is being smacked now, we would ask that people contact. We have a duty to report, as professionals. But if you were walking out, and you saw something happening to a child, in the same way as if you saw something to an adult.
Janet Finch-Saunders AM: Right.
Sally Jenkins: So, I think that the challenge is about--we've all probably, sadly, witnessed incidents in the doctor's reception, or in a supermarket, and we've failed to do something about it. And I think we then walk away and feel pretty guilty about that, realistically, when you see something happening to a child in a particular circumstance. I think we can't ignore the fact that a child is being assaulted in those circumstances.
Janet Finch-Saunders AM: Okay. Thank you. A campaign opposing this Bill, Be Reasonable Wales, have said that'If the law is changed, the consequences for parents will be considerable.'It also says,'Anyone accused or convicted of assaulting a child--under the new definition--'so, I suppose you could argue, a minor tap--'will be subject to long-term social services involvement in their family and social stigma.'To what extent is this accurate, and, also, will thresholds for social services intervention change if the Bill is enacted?
Sally Jenkins: There are a number of parts to that. Firstly, in terms of long-term social services intervention in a family's life, I think, for people to be fully aware of the very few numbers of families where we have long-term intervention currently, even where there is what would be perceived as very significant abuse. What we do is we go in for short periods in families'lives, to support them to work with their strengths, to work with them and their family members. It's not about us going into families, whatever some of the public perception may be. Our aim is to get in and get out. So, in terms of long-term intervention, what we want is for families to find their own solutions. We want families to be able to work with each other, and together, and local community support, and preventative services, to be able to address issues. This is not about punitive approaches from social services. So, that's the first element. In terms of thresholds for children's services, we would not be anticipating a huge number of referrals to us. There may be a small number of referrals that come through. What we know from other nations is that it will peak and then settle. We recognise that's likely to happen. Because we also know that this is actually quite a rare occurrence currently; this is not a defence that's being used with great frequency, this is not something that is happening. And if we look at the data, we know that the incidents of children, and the number of parents who now recognise this as an acceptable form of punishment, has steadily declined over the last 15 to 20 years. So it's diminishing as it is.
Janet Finch-Saunders AM: So, on that one then, is there a need for legislation that will--obviously there'll be resources for the Welsh Government and there'll be resources out of hours and things like that--is there a need for legislation if, as you say, natural behaviour and the culture is changing? Let's be honest, as you've rightly pointed out, in social services--I know in my own authority--in your own authority, you're saying that even now you're working with the police, on systematic failings within the system.
Sally Jenkins: Two things. Firstly, we want legislation that reflects our society--we don't want the two to be out of kilter. That would be my first natural response: surely our legislation should be reflective of what our world is. It shouldn't be that we've got these rather confusing elements running in parallel, and that continues to perpetuate a lack of clarity and the ambiguity that we currently see. I think the other element is that, again, this is about potentially an accelerating of that awareness and that culture in our society, about how we care for our children. We've got there naturally; we've got there by the change that's happened in Wales over the last 15 to 20 years. What this does is to continue with that change and continue with that awareness and understanding of how we positively, from a strength-based approach, should care for our children, bearing in mind what's required of us in terms of the UNCRC.
Janet Finch-Saunders AM: Okay. Are there any comments from anyone else?
Huw David: Simply to say that I think that, in terms of that clarity for the very vulnerable children out there who are currently being assaulted--seriously assaulted and abused by their parents, which goes on on a daily basis--that is already covered by existing legislation. But at the moment, they don't know, because they could be being told--and they probably are being told--by their parents that's it's okay, that they can smack their child and that that's acceptable. They don't know the difference. A young child is not going to know that difference and there is confusion about what is--. And if you asked most parents, and in fact lots of professionals, they would not be able to tell you, and probably most of you wouldn't be able to tell me exactly where is the threshold--
Janet Finch-Saunders AM: Yes, where's that line.
Huw David: Well, at the moment, we don't know where that line is. That vulnerable child, at home, being abused by their parents, does not know where that line is. And they should know where that line is because then they can pick up the phone to Childline or they can talk to a professional and ask them where that line is. So, that would be a step forward. I do recognise, though, that what we don't want to do--and the last thing any of us want to do--is criminalise parents who are bringing up their children. That is why we're saying there needs to be an emphasis on the support programmes that are available to parents. And to be clear, there is no way that we want long-term involvement in any child's life, but particularly not in the lives of children who have been smacked by their parents. That is not going to be the result of this legislation, trust me, because we don't want to be involved in--we haven't got the resources to be involved in children's lives. The social worker or the police officer--if they become involved, then there would be a proportionate response to that, and there'll also be a test about whether or not that is progressed. So, if there is an allegation--if this legislation is passed--then that will be looked into and a consideration will be made about whether any action will be taken, and as with any allegation of the law being broken, there would be a proportionate response, as there is now.
Lynne Neagle AM: And the next question does relate to the practical response to that. Janet.
Janet Finch-Saunders AM: Yes. Can you outline the practical ways in which social services'interaction with parents will change as a result of this proposed law and do you envisage that all referrals to the police will be automatically referred to social services for an assessment? Who's going to make those decisions?
Sally Jenkins: That will be part of the implementation phase about that decision making. Interestingly, the number of referrals that we currently get from the police that we take absolutely no action on is extraordinary. So, we get a very, very large number of--. It will be happening now; sitting in the civic centre in Newport City Council will be a whole host of social workers taking in the public protection notifications from overnight. It's 10 o'clock, so they're assessing them now, as we speak. And an awful lot of those will have no further action from the local authority.
Janet Finch-Saunders AM: But will they be investigated?
Sally Jenkins: No. There will be no action. There are countless referrals made by agencies to local authorities that we take no action on.
Janet Finch-Saunders AM: So, if there's an increase as a result of greater awareness--
Sally Jenkins: What happens is there is a paper assessment of them. There's a look at what's happened, who's involved, what the police have reported, and there's work being done with the police to improve that. Because one of the things that we want to get to is actually where we're not using huge amounts of time to look at that, but what comes to us is what we act on. So, there is work going on with a number of police authorities to look at how you improve that process. But I suppose, to pick up, each incident will be looked at, each one will be assessed in a way that is proportionate, as Huw says, to look at what's happened and then investigated.
Lynne Neagle AM: Sally, can you give us a couple of examples of what kind of things might have come in that you would then take no action on?
Sally Jenkins: We get countless referrals, for example, where there's been a domestic abuse incident overnight where a child wasn't present in the property and we then haven't taken action. It'll be where the level of harm that's perceived to happen to that child is below the threshold for intervention from children's services.
Janet Finch-Saunders AM: I'm pretty cynical about assessment, because, you know, I have people come in who are benefit claimants where, when they've been assessed, the whole process has been very flawed and I've had to fight and fight and fight on their behalf. So--
Sally Jenkins: Assessment processes within social--
Janet Finch-Saunders AM: But if you're struggling now with those assessments--
Sally Jenkins: Assessment processes within social services are as laid out in the Social Services and Well-being (Wales) Act 2014. So, we have within what we carry out, I suppose, that kind of initial look, that look at the information, what else do we know about that family--
Janet Finch-Saunders AM: And are they qualified people that are doing this?
Sally Jenkins: Yes, absolutely.
Huw David: And, in fact, in lots of places in Wales now, it's a multi-agency assessment. So, it's a joint assessment carried out with police professionals and health professionals.
Janet Finch-Saunders AM: So, what proportion currently would you not be taking any action on, if a report came in of some domestic abuse where a child had perhaps been smacked?
Sally Jenkins: If something came in to us where a child had been smacked and there was something clearly there, we would look at it. We would clearly look at it and we would take some sort of action.
Janet Finch-Saunders AM: Even now, before the legislation?
Sally Jenkins: Yes.
Lynne Neagle AM: Can you ask a final question? And I'm going to have to appeal for brief answers, because we've got a lot of ground to cover.
Huw David: Just very quickly, there may be no action from social services, but it doesn't mean that we don't offer support. So, the expectation is that support is offered in those circumstances from family support services, for example--
Sally Jenkins: Or prevention.
Huw David: --or prevention services. So, we would not say, if we were aware, for example, that there was domestic abuse at a home,'There's no role for children's social services', because there may be an assessment that that child may not be at immediate risk of harm, but we would obviously recognise that there are causes for concern there and we would offer that support. So, just to be clear about that. And that's a process that happens in every social services department in the UK, and it's happened for a very long time, and, in fact, it's reflective of the legislation that you have laid down as Assembly Members.
Lynne Neagle AM: And are those services there, Huw? Because I'm very acutely aware of the pressure on local government. Are the services there? Is there sufficient resource in things like Families First? Because what I'm hearing on the ground is that eligibility is changing for even those preventative services.
Huw David: There's not enough of those services, and, obviously--you may have heard me saying this before--I think we need to invest more in those services, and I hope you invest more in the services, because, obviously, prevention is better than cure. And those pressures that Sally talked about earlier are pressures that are not going away; they're only increasing by the day, actually, and I would want us to be able to offer those services now. Because that example of a child that perhaps is in a home where there is domestic abuse--we'll probably have another referral off them in a couple of months'time, and that could escalate. And what I'd rather do is provide support to that family and try and stop that family breaking down so that, in six months, we're not going back and saying that we've got to take this child into care because the domestic abuse has worsened and that child is at risk. But those services need additional investment.
Sally Jenkins: I appreciate that time is of the essence, but, just really quickly in relation to that, it's not just social services. So, for example, there are developments like Encompass, which is a piece of work that is being rolled out across Gwent and across other areas, which is where the police automatically notify the school overnight of an incident, not expecting the school to do anything per se, but to be aware, to be able to offer care for that child.
Alastair Birch: Can I add to that? Operation Encompass I know in Gwent has been operational, and we started it in Pembrokeshire 18 months ago. We as a local authority--and it'll be education that will contact the school around the domestic incident happening, and the school as part of that protocol will provide a level of universal service support for that child when they come in, before 9 o'clock, so that professionals are aware of the needs of the welfare of that child at that point. So, you know, schools play a key role in the universal service of this and we work very closely with our social care colleagues on that.
Lynne Neagle AM: Okay. Janet, your last question, please.
Janet Finch-Saunders AM: The Bill's explanatory memorandum refers to an estimate of 274 offences annually where lawful chastisement was used as a defence or considered. It says there is also potential to create extra demand on out-of-hours social services teams due to the time that the offences were reported, and in order to support safeguarding measures. Have you assessed how this Bill will impact on emergency and out-of-hours local authority services?
Sally Jenkins: We have considered that, and again I think that's something that we would very much want to look at as part of implementation. We have out-of-hours provision, we have emergency duty teams already across Wales that operate 24/7. There's no doubt that they exist and they work very closely with our police colleagues.
Janet Finch-Saunders AM: Are they overstretched at the moment?
Sally Jenkins: I think in the same way as all of social services is. If we were offered additional resource, we are going to take that. But are they working in a way that protects children day in, day out, and vulnerable adults? Yes, they are, and they will continue to do so.
Lynne Neagle AM: Thank you very much. We've got some specific questions now on the impact on education from Jayne Bryant.
Jayne Bryant AM: Thank you, Chair. Good morning. Alastair, you've already mentioned about awareness raising and training, which will be key with educational professionals. How confident are you that teachers and others working in those educational settings will be clear about how to support the implementation of this Bill, if enacted?
Alastair Birch: Training requirements for all professionals in education settings are clear. The universal tier 1 training is there, and all local authorities in Wales will implement that. In that level of general safeguarding awareness and training, the infinite emphasis is on the duty to report. That will remain the same. The thresholds for social care, that's their responsibility. That duty to report will always be there. It says in'Keeping learners safe', which is the bible in terms of education professionals, that there's a responsibility on the professional to make that referral and for that universal service. So, the more specialist safeguarding leads within the schools, who have become highly skilled professionals in terms of understanding what might be significant harm--because that's what we're talking about--they understand the legalities when a referral needs to be made. There's always the collation of safeguarding information, where there might be just general concerns about neglect and other areas, which combined would create a picture that there might be significant neglect or significant harm to the child, and then that referral would be made to the child care assessment team or the police. So, that awareness--it needs to be clear for educational professionals that that duty to report is always there. If they believe that that significant harm has happened then that report then goes to the child care assessment team. They will make the judgment on the threshold because they are the professionals. They have the multi-agency awareness of how that meets the threshold. But in terms of education, it'll be that awareness, making sure that there's clarity. If there's anything that professionals need to be trained additionally on, it'll need to go into'Keeping learners safe', which at the moment is being rewritten. So, there would have to be some new possible information there relating to this. But as long as there's clarity, and once that implementation phase and the discussion has happened, as long as it's clear for professionals that the duty is always there and they feel a significant harm, then that report will always be there and will always need to be made. It's making sure--and I'll echo what my colleague said, Huw--that the services are key for families. Schools are absolutely fundamental in that support for the families. They have those relationships with the families. I know there was discussion around professional trust. On a daily basis, professionals are working on that trust with parents, because they are the ones that can engage with those families. The family support officers that are working on the ground with highly complex families, with multiple leads and supporting the children--they are fundamental, and investment in that level of support would also help our colleagues as well. So, anything that's preventative. That is already happening in schools and is effective, and is shown to be effective, and has an evidence base--we'd always support that that would continue to be invested in. So, that's really my answer.
Jayne Bryant AM: Okay. And you were saying about how important trust is as well, but do you think that there's a risk that those in education settings will have a key role in referring more parents to social services, which some have said could cause potential harm to relationships and cause mistrust?
Alastair Birch: I don't think it's a matter of mistrust--it's a matter of, you know, if a professional believes, based on the evidence that they have, because they're working with that child every day, that there is significant harm to that child, they are under a duty to report that to social care. So, part of the work is with families, and most of the referrals we make are with parental consent. That consent is a key element of this, and conversation with our social care colleagues is usually,'You need to speak to the parents again and have a conversation with them.'Some of the NFAs--the ones that don't get referred at threshold--it will come back to school for, possibly, some support from the family or a team around the family or some other aspect. So, I don't think--. The trust in the professionals--it's actually more important that we are seen to be upholding our duties under the all-Wales safeguarding procedures. That's what engenders trust in a professional workforce.
Jayne Bryant AM: Okay, thank you.
Lynne Neagle AM: Thank you very much. We're going to move on now to some questions about the importance of awareness raising from Sian Gwenllian.
Sian Gwenllian AM: Good morning. In looking at your written evidence, you say that we must make it very clear to parents, guardians and the public that this legislation is not trying to criminalise parents, and that is clearly very important for you. How do you think we should do that and who should be doing that work?
Sally Jenkins: I think that's really broad. Obviously, colleagues in education, colleagues in social care, colleagues in preventative services, but also Welsh Government and the National Assembly, in terms of those drivers in relation to that awareness raising are really, really key. If you look at some of the other campaigns that have been run, notably in relation to violence against women, domestic abuse and sexual violence, and echoing some of those building campaigns that have been done to raise awareness--I think those would be really good models to begin to consider in terms of how this is taken forward with awareness. We also know that there are a number of routes that we can go through in terms of raising awareness. We have existing preventative services, we have all our universal services, we have the regional safeguarding boards and the national safeguarding boards. So, there are a number of avenues that we could then explore. In terms of not wishing to criminalise, I think if we look at the numbers, they are very, very small. And I think one of the things we need to hold on to in this is a sense of proportion about what is or isn't likely to happen once or if this Bill ever gets to the point of Royal Assent--they are small numbers who currently use this defence. It is about that wider issue of awareness raising, and using all of those avenues will help us to do that in the broadest sense.
Sian Gwenllian AM: Do you, therefore, believe that this needs to be on the face of the Bill? That is, you don't say this in your evidence. I'd like to know your opinion on that. Scotland is going to be making it a duty for Scottish Ministers to raise awareness of the impact of the Bill. So far, the Welsh Government says that we don't need to do that in Wales. Wouldn't it make it clearer for you if it was a clear duty on the face of the Bill, for example as it was with the Human Transplantation (Wales) Act 2013? There was a duty in that Act for Ministers to promote transplantation. Surely, that awareness raising aspect would be clearer for everyone if it was on the face of the Bill. Do you have an opinion on that?
Huw David: Well, Welsh Government have given that commitment, and I know the Welsh Government honour every commitment that they make--[Laughter. ]
Sian Gwenllian AM: That's why I'm asking.
Huw David: I don't know whether that is necessary--I'm not a legislator. I think that there's obviously an inherent interest in Welsh Government raising awareness, because we have to raise awareness effectively for this to be successful, otherwise we will have parents who feel that they're being criminalised, and that's the last thing we want. I think it's worthy of consideration, but, as I say, I'm not a legislator or a lawyer, so I don't know what implications that will have long term. But to be fair to Welsh Government, I think that commitment is one that I'm sure will be honoured, because Welsh Government will want to make a success of this Bill if it does receive Royal Assent.
Sian Gwenllian AM: Okay. But is it clear who would pay for all of that?
Huw David: I've suddenly changed my mind--[Laughter. ] I think it should be a duty on Welsh Government Ministers--absolutely. I don't need to check with lawyers or legislators. There we go. And that's the WLGA position; I don't need to ask the other 21 leaders on that either. [Laughter. ]
Sian Gwenllian AM: Wouldn't it make it clearer if there was a clear duty on the face of the Bill that awareness raising had to happen? It would be clearer, then, for local authorities and people in the front-line services what needs to happen.
Sally Jenkins: I'm going to echo Huw. [Laughter. ]
Sian Gwenllian AM: I thought you might. Okay, fine.
Lynne Neagle AM: Okay. We're moving on now, then, to the contentious issue of resources and we've got some questions from Hefin.
Hefin David AM: Sally Jenkins, you said that the purpose of the Bill is to bring clarity and to remove what is a little-used defence. Isn't this an expensive way of doing that?
Sally Jenkins: I don't think so, no. I think that our children deserve the best legislation.
Hefin David AM: But introducing this legislation diverts finances from other areas of children's services--or doesn't?
Sally Jenkins: Well, I would say, no, I don't think it will divert resources from children's services. Firstly, going back to the comment made, I think, proportionally, this is a very small number of cases. It's a very small number of existing cases that go through in terms of prosecution, or consideration for prosecution. We know that it's likely, from some of the work that we've already done, that it's not opening floodgates for a sudden sea of referrals to children's services--that's not the way this is going to be, because the numbers are not out there because of the changes that have already happened in Welsh family life and Welsh society. So, I think as part of the implementation phase, we need to have a really clear understanding of the trajectory of those costs and what's likely to happen over the first six months, 12 months in terms of people's awareness and understanding and what is referred and how that's worked. But in terms of a huge number, no, I don't anticipate it being that.
Hefin David AM: But the costs wouldn't just be directed to the number of referrals and the number of cases raised, it's the cost around that, with training of staff, awareness--all those extra additional costs that always come with legislation. Is it too much? Is it--?
Sally Jenkins: No. And I agree with that--that there clearly are--but if you think, many of those things will be aligned with work we are already doing, but it brings a clarity to that work. So, our teachers, our social workers, our health workers, our police officers already get substantial training around child protection, around safeguarding, around adverse childhood experiences and around a trauma-informed approach to children. What this does is it layers a clarity on that. But rather than having a part of that training, which has to deal with this as an aspect--that is no longer there; it is a clear message for all professions.
Hefin David AM: I fully appreciate that, and in the briefing note you've given us, you've outlined the pressures on social services. So, do you think this is another way of getting money into social services?
Sally Jenkins: If this was a way of getting money into--. I can think of better ways, but I don't think this is it. No, I mean, I absolutely do not think that. I think this is a clear commitment to the rights of children in Wales; this is not about levering additional resources into children's services. Oh that it was so simple.
Hefin David AM: Okay. And, do you think those costs are quantifiable?
Sally Jenkins: I think we are currently looking at work and are doing work across my own local authority and across two others to look at breaking down those costs, not just for local authority, but also for health, for police and for Children and Family Court Advisory and Support Service Cymru. So, there is work currently taking place to try to quantify those costs.
Hefin David AM: Okay. I think there was a bit about local authorities that Sian--
Lynne Neagle AM: Okay. Sian Gwenllian has got a question on resources.
Sian Gwenllian AM: Yes, just to carry on from that, in a way. The explanatory memorandum that accompanies the Bill talks about the unknown costs for different agencies. You mentioned there that you're doing work around trying to identify some of those costs, but wouldn't it be useful if the explanatory memorandum did explain more about any unknown or unidentified costs, partly in order to calm some of those fears around that? Giving a title'unidentified costs'--is that good enough?
Sally Jenkins: I think, clearly, that is a challenge, and that is work that we are participating in and are committed to completing with Welsh Government, to look at what those costs are.
Sian Gwenllian AM: And then they can be added into this.
Huw David: I think this is where it would be helpful in the committee's deliberations and where our concern would be, because the reality is we're not going to know what the costs are until it's actually implemented, because we haven't implemented this before. And, therefore, I think there needs to be a commitment that, whatever the costs are, those costs are met because it is legislation that is being led by the National Assembly for Wales. And whilst we don't see it as levering in additional resources, we don't think it should be at the expense of current service provision to vulnerable families in Wales, and therefore it's important that it is properly and fully resourced.
Sian Gwenllian AM: What I would argue on that is that you have to try and forecast. You say it's difficult to forecast how much this is going to cost, but we have to try and forecast that, and part of the argument for trying to have projections is to show that, perhaps, it's not going to cost that much, and that would add to the argument that,'Okay, this is going to be fine to do and it's not going to put too much pressure on us'. Or we need to know that this is going to cost a lot to do it effectively, and therefore you have to make your argument, then,'Well, we can't afford that, the money has to come from somewhere else.'We have to get the costs, surely.
Huw David: Yes, and we will work very closely with Welsh Government to try and establish those costs as quickly as possible. There will be some costs that we will be able to identify. So, for example, a campaign, an awareness-raising campaign, the marketing, if you like, but some of the other costs will be more difficult to establish in terms of the resource implications for front-line workers. I expressed a view that we need to see some additional investment in some of those programmes that are not targeted directly at families that would be impacted by this but support all families across Wales that have different needs, and some of that provision is universal. Obviously, my view is the more we put into that, the better. So, there's no limit to that, but I suspect Welsh Government will take a very different view to that. But I think that is something where we need to see a commitment to some additional resources. But I don't put an upper limit on that, because I don't think there's an authority in Wales, and I don't think there's a charity, a police service or a health board in Wales that doesn't think that we need to do more of that and could offer more of that if the resources were available.
Sian Gwenllian AM: Okay, thank you.
Lynne Neagle AM: Okay. We've come to the end of our time, so can I thank you all for attending and for answering all of our questions? It's been a really useful and informative discussion. As usual, you'll be sent a transcript to check for accuracy following the meeting, but thank you again, all of you, for coming.
Huw David: And thank you for your questions and engagement. We welcome the opportunity.
Alastair Birch: Thank you very much.
Sally Jenkins: Thank you very much.
Lynne Neagle AM: Okay, item 3 is papers to note. Paper to note 1 is a letter from the Minister for Housing and Local Government--additional information for our inquiry into school funding. Paper to note 2 is a letter from the Minister for Health and Social Services on in-patient child and adolescent mental health services provision, and I would like to briefly return to that when we go into private. Are Members happy to note those? Thank you. Item 4, then: can I propose a motion under Standing Order 17. 42 to resolve to exclude the public for the remainder of the meeting? Are Members content? Thank you.","There were totally two questions proposed on impact on education. First, Jayne Bryant asked how confident they were that teachers and others working in those educational settings would be clear about how to support the implementation of this Bill. Alastair Birch responded that training requirements for all professionals in education settings were clear. The awareness needed to be clear for educational professionals that the duty to report was there. The second question was about whether there was a risk that those in education settings would have a key role in referring more parents to social services, which could cause potential harm to relationships and cause mistrust. Alastair Birch disagreed that this was a matter of mistrust. He thought if a professional believed there was significant harm to that child, they were under a duty to report that to social care.",qmsum
"Summarize the discussion about an interactive evaluation in terms of the user requiremnets and the hot trends.
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Um almost, there's one more thing I have to get out of the {disfmarker} I have to make sure that this attachment will open.
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} I keep forgetting whether I've done this. {gap}.
Project Manager: Ah-ha. Okay. We'll open that when the time is right. In the meantime {disfmarker} Closing things down, okay. Let's see what this thing does. Does it come up together or disappear one of them or what? Ah, we came up together, we're good. Okay. Are we ready to start? Okay. It's now quarter of four. This is a f another forty minute one so it will end at four twenty five. Okay. Right. Our agenda is, as before, for me to open the meeting, for us to go over the previous minutes, then for the two of you to present your prototype and for you to g um Sarah present the evaluation criteria. We then have a finance aspect, which is a spreadsheet, an Excel spreadsheet. And I know what you're all thinking of, oh my, um because we're only given a forty minute time period to get it all in, including the production evaluation. So we're going to make a very fast track. Okay. Um and as you can see that's what we do next on this thing. So the first thing I have to do is close this so that I can get to {disfmarker} Where is it? {vocalsound}
Marketing: Red.
Project Manager: I need to open mine. Not the agenda.
Marketing: Agenda three.
Project Manager: No that th I want the minutes from the previous {disfmarker} minutes.
Marketing: Mm.
Project Manager: That should be there, minutes. Yeah. Okay. Uh from meeting three, is it alright with you if I don't switch it to show, just use it as is?'Cause this way I can more easily flip it. Okay, um obviously all of us were here for the last meeting, we reviewed the previous minutes before that, um each of you made your presentations. {vocalsound} Um we discussed the various possibilities based on what was presented in those presentations. The market trend of fruit and veg, mm spongy, uh fancy and elegant more than technologically innovative and that more than easy. Um we decided chip on print would be used. Um we would use plastic with a rubber casing, I think was the consensus, powered by kinetic energy. There was no decision made on the curvatures or double curvature or straight. Um perhaps the prototype will give us an inkling of that. Um looking like a scroll, but it's really a push button technology, excuse my spelling um that was actually in use, that is uh behind the scenes is push button which we uh according to Kate have a very good uh grasp on doing that in production. Um we decided that separate fashionable covers covering your fruit and veg might be a separate product that could be suggested to management. Um and as suggested um yellow with black buttons with the company logo, a slogan and image might be a good idea based on the requirements that have been provided to us. Um we did have a few production issues and coordination of the various bits and we had some conflict of ideas and cost constraints and we ran out of time. Um we had to follow that up and prepare for the last one. And uh we closed as it ran out of time. Is that a fair presentation of what happened?
Industrial Designer: Yep.
User Interface: Yes.
Project Manager: Okay, back to this meeting. Um we're down to the prototype presentation.
Industrial Designer: Ta-da.
User Interface: Alright.
Project Manager: Over to you.
Industrial Designer: Right.
User Interface: Well.
Project Manager: Ooh, two.
User Interface: Yeah, well you see, each made one, we didn't have enough yellow dough.
Project Manager: Ah.
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
User Interface: This is the one that I made.
Project Manager: Uh-huh.
User Interface: It is uh curved, easy to hold, hand-held, nice and small with big easy buttons. This is like a scroll, but they are push buttons and they enter {disfmarker} takes you into the different menus. Of course we need someone who's experienced with the television {gap}. I mean this is the infrared thing that's gonna zap at the television. Uh I'm not quite sure how to make that, but I'm sure it will work. Uh this is on off switch,'cause I think we do need that, and I think it gives it a nice balance.
Project Manager:'Kay.
User Interface: And it's gonna have the logo imprinted on it uh in there.
Project Manager: Okay.
User Interface: Um as for what it's actually made of {disfmarker} well the function of these buttons is up, down, left and right {vocalsound} in the different menus.
Project Manager: Okay.
User Interface: Uh position, I presume that just means right right on it, easy to see. The main feature of it is just a simple design, simple, lack of uh buttons all over the place. Right? {vocalsound} Form curved, kind of smooth, hand-held, makes it feel nice to hold. Uh material, I think Kate's gonna tackle that quite a bit, but I think we have two different options, because we did make a another one, which wa uh is in the shape of banana, it's just {disfmarker} if you can imagine this as yellow with black buttons, like just like this but in the shape of a banana,
Project Manager: Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.
User Interface: which is also nice and easy to hold and feels good and has a similar sort of scroll push button technology, just a slightly different design.
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
User Interface: Also with on off switch and infrared {disfmarker} {vocalsound} uh I had envisioned it in hard smooth plastic. So like uh {disfmarker} well, I dunno, what's it like? I guess like an existing remote control, but molded and smooth. Whereas otherwise we'd thought, like with this one {disfmarker} or mix and match, just we were gonna see what you thought, the {disfmarker} uh a more spongy rubber cover with spongy buttons. So we have the two options we can follow, either the smooth hard plastic or the spongy rubber, depending on cost restraints. And what we well, what conclusion we reach when we discuss it. {vocalsound} Uh material {disfmarker} yeah, that's what I have to say about material. Can I scroll down on there and see what else {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Mm-hmm.
User Interface: Well colour, I think {disfmarker} I definitely have a preference towards bright yellow with black buttons, because that's the company colours, but if anybody's got any other suggestions, I'm quite willing to consider them as well. {vocalsound} So, it just depends what you think about these ideas and if I'm {disfmarker} yeah, maybe, Kate, you better say what you think about them.
Industrial Designer: Um well I don't have very much to add. Um the the case {disfmarker} oops, that's the uh on off button just come off our prototype.
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: The the case can be either um spongy rubber or hard plastic. We're not absolutely sure about a combination of the two, but it can be either of those. We have the technology to do that. Um and as for the the actual components um, uh Steph just said this is a {disfmarker} quite a cheap device to manufacture. We have simple rubber push buttons um which provide all the functionality we need. Um the um {vocalsound} the diode that actually does the um infrared is at the end, it's the stalk of the banana, or it's just the thing at the end of this version. Um so that's for material. Colour, well uh Steph's the expert on colour. Um we we don't have any particular restrictions on that. Yeah, I think that's all we've got to say really.
User Interface: I thin as for as for the fruit or organic theme, I guess this one is obviously fruit shaped.
Industrial Designer: A banana.
User Interface: This one has n banana, yeah. This one has no obvious connections to fruit, but because it's round and molded, it kinda makes you think sort of organic, touchy-feely, kiddie, it's more like {disfmarker} yeah, you'd expect it to be like a child's sorta toy remote control instead of a real one, which I quite like that sort of image.'Cause it's very big and chunky and child-friendly and
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} Would you care to examine the prototypes, see how they feel in the hand?
User Interface: {vocalsound} Hold them, you see, you know. Curvature, is it to your liking?
Project Manager: Oh I see, the on-off's in the back.
Industrial Designer: Yes, that's so that your index finger automatically goes straight to it.
User Interface: {vocalsound} If you don't wanna tire out your thumbs after all.
Project Manager: And then you can use your thumb. {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: And it was partly we thought the design looked better,
User Interface: Yeah. {gap}
Project Manager: I could see this thing, unless it's reinforced, having a problem with the you know {disfmarker}
User Interface: Breaking,
Project Manager: yeah.
User Interface: oh right. {vocalsound} Well you see, that's why hard plastic would be quite a good thing for it, because then it'd just be rigid.
Marketing: I like the fact that on both of them the keys play such a prominent role.
Project Manager: Hmm.
User Interface: Yeah, {gap} we really like we really like that design,
Marketing: It's really kind of a {disfmarker}
User Interface: I mean it looks just like a logo, that arrangement of the keys. Like a c like a compass point, you know,
Marketing: Mm-hmm mm-hmm.
User Interface: just up, down, left and right, and we think we could make that quite a good feature. And it's like the the iPod scroll wheel, {vocalsound} but better.
Marketing: Yeah. But it's also like texting,
User Interface: Yeah. Yeah, yeah,
Marketing: you don't {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Hmm.
User Interface: I mean it {disfmarker} that's what it makes me think of, mobile phones,
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
User Interface: I was try I was thinking, moving your thumb like this, what does that remind me of?
Industrial Designer: And it's a very simple design,
Marketing: Yeah.
User Interface: It's texting.
Industrial Designer: there's not a lot to wrong, the components are cheap to make.
Marketing: It's also in terms of um being lost it's it's quite {disfmarker} it looks quite different.
User Interface: Hmm.
Marketing: You know, I I d I have several {disfmarker} four remotes, and they all look the same until you get up close and you have to {disfmarker}
User Interface: Yeah.
Marketing: you know, this is really identifiable.
User Interface: {vocalsound} I mean the thing is we do need to develop our technology of {disfmarker} {vocalsound} I mean actually how to program the menus and what sort of, you know, text box is gonna appear at the bottom of the screen,
Marketing: Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.
User Interface: but we do definitely think that it's a viable option.
Project Manager: Okay. The next item is evaluation.
Marketing: No, okay.
Project Manager: Uh if that's {disfmarker} if you're finished.
User Interface: {vocalsound} Uh yeah, we're finished.
Marketing: Um {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Mm-hmm.
Marketing: shall I take your uh power?
Project Manager: Oh sorry.
Marketing: Oh.
Project Manager: {vocalsound} Try again.
Marketing: Okay. This is going to be a heavily interactive evaluation, and the method here is to evaluate the new remote control in terms of the user requirements and the hot trends introduced by the marketing department. So, this means we're going to go over the priorities that were raised by uh the consumers a as well as incorporate all of our insight into this uh evaluation exercise. So I'm going to go and use the whiteboard, and I've made a list of criteria to look at, and so I'm gonna I'm gonna leave this up as the last thing, but for the evaluation it's going to be one is true and seven is false, going over these different criteria, so one true seven false and I'm gonna now use the um the board. Okay. So um fancy, technologically innovative, easy to use, trendy, buttons, excess buttons, good buttons, ugly, sellable, and other. And in fact I hope that uh you all introduce some additional terms, because these are things that um have been brought up, some of them seem rather close,
User Interface: Yeah, what about price, is that gonna go on there as well? Price of materials.
Marketing: like they overlap. Mm, yeah, price.
Project Manager: Hmm.
Marketing: We'll put price up at the top.
User Interface: {vocalsound} Not that we actually know anything about it,
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
User Interface: but we can we can pretend.
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Well we will soon, unfortunately.
Marketing: Um Okay, so {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Come on.
Marketing: Did you say {gap}?
Project Manager: No, {gap}.
Marketing: Uh okay, so wha how do we feel in terms of is this fancy?
User Interface: It depends what what you mean by fancy really,'cause when I think of fancy, I think of it's got lots of extra sort of fripperies and, you know, like baroque curliness and {disfmarker} which
Marketing: {vocalsound} Mm-hmm.
User Interface: I'd call these quite uh minimalist,
Industrial Designer: Yes, a plain, simple, clean design.
User Interface: simple and plain, but I mean I do see what {disfmarker} {vocalsound} it is heavily reliant on appearance instead of pure functionality,
Marketing: Mm-hmm.
User Interface: so in that respect it is quite fancy.
Marketing: {vocalsound} I {disfmarker} yeah, so in that respect {disfmarker} I think we'll go with that respect.
User Interface: I think just maybe we need a different word other than fancy, I'd say maybe aesthetic.
Marketing: Yeah.
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} Well we have got s trendy further down,
Project Manager: Elegant.
Industrial Designer: but {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Elegant.
Marketing: Elegant.
Industrial Designer: Elegant, I don't know if I'd call them elegant.
Marketing: Yeah, no these aren't the exact terms that the um {disfmarker}
User Interface: {gap} like stylish or aesthetic.
Industrial Designer: Stylish, yeah.
Marketing: Yeah. Elegant. We're gon let's use elegant, although the the the people, the word on the street is is {vocalsound} {disfmarker}
User Interface: Fancy.
Marketing: Yeah. {vocalsound} N that {disfmarker} um
User Interface: Did you just break the pen?
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
Marketing: yeah uh {disfmarker} the uh {disfmarker} is fancy. So let's let's take it to the next level.
User Interface: Well d we'll just call it fancy then.
Marketing: Well okay, so in terms of elegant, fancy. we'll call it E_F_ um, do we do we think that perhaps {disfmarker} and maybe we should say the yellow? Should we go with the yellow in terms of {disfmarker} I think that's a really superior {disfmarker}
User Interface: Yeah, I think we n we need to {disfmarker}
Marketing: they're both {disfmarker}
User Interface: they're both yellow with black buttons, it's just that we didn't have any more dough to represent uh that,
Marketing: Yeah.
Project Manager: Mm.
User Interface: but if you can just imagine banana shape with these bits as black.
Marketing: Yeah.
User Interface: So what we re really need to decide is whether we want the actual banana shape or just a a purely blob or some sort of abstraction in between the two
Marketing: Yeah.
User Interface: that isn't {disfmarker} that is more curved, like a banana, but that isn't actually recognisable as a banana, you know, with the grooves and the stalk and stuff,
Marketing: As a banana.
User Interface: so.
Marketing: I think that many of us are abstract enough to look at the yellow one and say we'll call it the banana.
Project Manager: Yeah.
Marketing: And of the two I really like I m I like the banana,
Project Manager: The chunk.
Marketing: but I I do like the chunk.
User Interface: So that's maybe not something we have to decide just right now, is it.
Marketing: No,
User Interface: Just somewhere a long the scale of in between these two.
Marketing: but I mean in terms {disfmarker} we have to evaluate one of them. Unless {disfmarker} do you guys wanna evaluate both?
Project Manager: I think between the two, somewhere between the two is true.
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} Yeah, I'd {disfmarker}
Project Manager: It's more true than false, about a two.
Marketing: Okay. So we say true. {vocalsound} technologically innovative.
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: I d I don't think that's what we're aiming at with this concept.
Marketing: Yeah.
Industrial Designer: I think we're using simple components that are gonna be robust but not particularly innovative.
Marketing: So we'll say {disfmarker} we'll say uh false. Easy to use.
Industrial Designer: Very.
User Interface: Yes.
Marketing: {vocalsound} One,
Project Manager: Mm-hmm.
Marketing: is that inappropriate?
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
Marketing: Okay. Oh, pardon me. Um
Project Manager: Trendy.
User Interface: Oh yes.
Marketing: trendy, s {vocalsound} and I say specifically spongy fruity.
Project Manager: Mm-hmm.
User Interface: Well, maybe only a two or a three then,'cause it's no we still haven't decided about specific sponginess or specific {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: We have the worry about how robust it will be if it's it's curved as a banana but spongy.
Project Manager: Hmm.
Industrial Designer: I think {disfmarker}
User Interface: Yeah, I don't really think that's gonna work,
Industrial Designer: yeah.
User Interface: but {disfmarker}
Marketing: {vocalsound} Okay, so two? Um
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
Project Manager: Excess buttons.
Marketing: are there excess buttons?
Project Manager: No.
Industrial Designer: No.
User Interface: No.
Marketing: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} That is false.
Industrial Designer: So that's false. {vocalsound}
Marketing: Um {vocalsound} good, well designed buttons, intuitive buttons.
Project Manager: Better, more intuitive buttons, yes.
Marketing: True. Ugly.
Industrial Designer: No.
User Interface: No. {vocalsound}
Project Manager: No.
Marketing: People don't respond well to ugly. Sellable, uh quirky, you know, something people {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Yeah, I think they're different, aren't they?
User Interface: Well it is quite it is quite quirky I think.
Marketing: like oh,
Project Manager: I like it.
Marketing: yeah. Yeah, I do too.
User Interface: It could be quite a good brand, like a good little object.
Marketing: Oh yeah. And I was I was thinking of other things um in terms of uh could we say it's cost saving? With the {disfmarker}
User Interface: Oh, we also need tho think about the energy. Is it the kinetic energy?
Marketing: Yeah, with the energy.
Industrial Designer: Mm. {vocalsound}
User Interface: If it's {disfmarker} it is gonna be environmentally friendly with the kinetic energy.
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
Marketing: It is going to be kinetic?
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
Project Manager: Mm-hmm.
Marketing: we'll c we'll say it's a cost saving enviro. Yeah, Uh so yes.
User Interface: Yeah, but we haven't completely developed that side of it yet, so we're not completely sure about that,
Marketing: Well {vocalsound}
User Interface: but yeah.
Marketing: you're still in the Play-Doh stage.
User Interface: Yeah.
Marketing: Anything else? Including price, do you have any idea about price or other features?
Industrial Designer: Well I think our instinct is that it should be pretty cheap to develop. We haven't got a lot of expensive components in there.
Project Manager: Yes, the instinct says true.
Marketing: Okay. So true one or should I go to two or three?
Industrial Designer: I'd put it at one I think, but {disfmarker} I dunno, what do you {disfmarker}
User Interface: I would say maybe a two,
Marketing: Okay.
User Interface:'cause we still {disfmarker} we need to uh get somebody in who is good with the programming for the menus and things.
Industrial Designer: Yeah, true,
User Interface: I mean it's not just like {disfmarker} I mean it's not like ev you know, on a normal chunky remote every button res I mean means something different,
Project Manager: Yeah, that's not a cheap thing to get.
Industrial Designer: it might be the {disfmarker} yeah, yeah, true. True.
User Interface: whereas this one has only got the four buttons and they all {disfmarker} they mean everything, depending on what menu you're in.
Project Manager: Hmm.
Industrial Designer: Yeah, that's a good point.
User Interface: {gap} uh we need somebody to develop that.
Marketing: Um other? Anything else you guys can thing of? And I'm gonna actually change a couple of these so then I'm gonna {disfmarker} instead of ugly I'm gonna say it's attractive and then make that true, so that {disfmarker}
User Interface: Yeah.
Marketing:'cause I have to do an average. {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} Right.
Marketing: And then um excess buttons.
User Interface: Just putting no excess buttons.
Marketing: Exactly. Wow we're doing really well. Yeah, be you know,
User Interface: As for {disfmarker}
Marketing: so it doesn't ruin the polarity.
User Interface: see if we're technologically innovative, I'd say it is quite innovative, because there aren't really many that have this menu idea instead of all the extra buttons.
Marketing: Mm-hmm.
User Interface: I mean I know we're not doing anything involving internet or speech recognition but but we are at the upper end of the push button market. {vocalsound}
Marketing: Or L_C_D_. Yeah. Well if you g uh let me know if if any of these {disfmarker} um if you if you all can think of any other um thing to change here {disfmarker} if you th if you think I should change the innovative or add other features. If not I'll average those.
Project Manager: I think we're good.
Marketing: {vocalsound} Okay. Mm.
Project Manager: Okay. We're a little over halfway through the meeting
Marketing: So {disfmarker}
Project Manager: and the next big thing is the finance. Okay.
Marketing: Um okay, how about if I uh pass this back to you
Project Manager: Yep.
Marketing: and I'll uh figure out the average here.
Project Manager: Right.
Marketing: Thank you for everyone's help with that.
Project Manager: Right. And as you can see it says the same thing, it had not lost itself, thank Goodness. And we're going to raise what's called a sp a spreadsheet that they provided to me. Um and it says fill in the number of components you plan to use in your device.
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Hand dynamo, battery, kinetic, solar cells. Okay.
User Interface: Well, just kinetic then, {gap}.
Project Manager: Yeah.
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} Yeah.
Project Manager: Um what's a hand dynamo?
Industrial Designer: That was the crank, wind-up crank on the side. {vocalsound}
User Interface: It's the wind-up.
Project Manager: Oh
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: shoot, forget that. Kinetic is um {disfmarker} and how many of those will we need per {disfmarker} we only need one.
Industrial Designer: Just one.
Project Manager: Okay. Electronic simple chip on print, and we'll need one of those.
Industrial Designer: Uh uh yeah, I think we can do it all with simple {disfmarker} Just checking that. Yeah, simple,'cause we've just got push buttons, so we can do it all with simple which is the ch should be the cheapest.
Project Manager: Okay, and we only need one of those.
Industrial Designer: Yep.
Project Manager: Okay, the case will be uncurved and flat or a single curve or a double curve. It looks like it {gap} single curve,'cause of th the chunkiness. It's {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Yeah, that that one is single curve,
Project Manager: that's uh uh one.
Industrial Designer: isn't it? Um do we have
Project Manager: And that's
User Interface: What does double curved mean, I don't understand.
Industrial Designer: I I think you {disfmarker} it means you reverse the curve.
Project Manager: uh that's the the one that goes like this.
Industrial Designer: Yeah. Yeah, I do I don't think we need that for either of them,
User Interface: Oh no, we don't need that. No.
Project Manager: Right.
Industrial Designer: you can do a banana in single curve,
Project Manager: No,
User Interface: Single-curved, I'd say.
Project Manager: single curve.
Industrial Designer: yeah.
Project Manager: Okay, case material supplements. Plastic, wood, rubber, titanium, special colour.
User Interface: I
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
User Interface: I just wanna say plastic.
Project Manager: We had the special colour. And did we say plastic?
Industrial Designer: Yeah, can we do some what ifs,'cause it may {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Yeah.
Industrial Designer: I mean I I still quite like the idea of combining plastic and rubber myself,
Marketing: One, two, three, four, five, six.
Industrial Designer: but it depends on the cost, I guess.
Project Manager: Okay. We'll come back, if we can, to the rubber being added at the moment, that's where we are. Interface button {disfmarker} push button interface. That's what we're using,
User Interface: It's just button.
Industrial Designer: Yes.
User Interface: Yeah.
Project Manager: isn't it?
Industrial Designer: Yep.
User Interface: Yeah.
Industrial Designer: Do we need to say how many buttons, or
Project Manager: Whoops, don't want that, not yet. Um {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: or d is it just one?
Project Manager: No, it just says push button interface. Button supplements, they'll be in a special colour of black.
Industrial Designer:'Kay.
Project Manager: And the buttons {disfmarker} Wha what is the buttons made of, rubber?
Industrial Designer: Uh they'll be rubber, yep.
Project Manager: So we need one of them. And are they any special form?
User Interface: Well yeah, like the compass point one.
Industrial Designer: Actually, does tha does special material mean that plastic is not a special material?'Cause I think they can be plastic.
Project Manager:'Cause the rate we're going we can put the rubber on top.
Industrial Designer: Yeah. They could be plastic, we don't have to have rubber buttons,
Project Manager: Oh.
Industrial Designer: because we haven't got a double curved case.
User Interface: Yeah, they could be plastic.
Project Manager: {vocalsound} Okay. Um let's put that rubber in then, of the case material supplement.
Industrial Designer: It's just one, isn't it?
Project Manager: Uh we only need one of them. Um and the total cost has been calculated as nine Pounds twenty out of the twelve and a half we were allowed.
Industrial Designer: What, we're in.
Marketing: Yeah.
Project Manager: We're in. {vocalsound} That's us.
Industrial Designer: More profit.
User Interface: Great.
Project Manager: Okay, I'm going to save this into our {vocalsound} desktop, project documents. Okay. As our project document bit.
Industrial Designer: Do you do you need to double click on that to open it?
Project Manager: Yeah. There we are. That's the only Excel document that will be in there, so it's there for all of us. Okay, so, are they under twelve fifty? Yes, go to the project evaluation, next slide.
User Interface: Yes.
Project Manager: Right. Um the project process, satisfaction with, for example, the room for creativity. Yeah, leadership, teamwork,
User Interface: Yeah.
Marketing: Sure. Yes.
Project Manager: means, of having whiteboard, the digital pens and all that kind of good things.
Marketing: {vocalsound}
User Interface: And Play-Doh.
Project Manager: Uh-huh.
Industrial Designer: Yeah, yeah, the Play-Doh was best, I thought. {vocalsound}
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
User Interface: Yeah well,'cause I mean it's so hard to describe what you mean just with words and pointing at photographs and saying, well we quite want this, but imagine it rounder. So much better just to go and, you know, this is it, this is what we want. {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} Yep.
Project Manager: Okay. {vocalsound} So, we went over all those things and we're satisfied with all the above.
Marketing: Yep.
Project Manager: Um did we find any new ideas?
Marketing: I think with the marketing element of uh fruit shaped I I mean I {disfmarker} that really opened my eyes.
User Interface: Yeah. {vocalsound} Spongy.
Marketing: I I only speak for myself though.
User Interface: And I'd never heard of the kinetic energy before,
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} Yeah.
User Interface: so. Good work as a design team,
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} Yeah, I think we're a good team actually.
User Interface: because we {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: I'm not sure all the wires are really great though.
Project Manager: So we actually worked well as a group.
Industrial Designer: I thought so.
Project Manager: Right. Are the costs within the budget? Yes.
User Interface: Oh yes.
Marketing: Yes.
Project Manager: Is the project evaluated?
Industrial Designer: Yes.
Project Manager: Yes.
Industrial Designer: Yes.
User Interface: Yes.
Marketing: I can give you a number,
Industrial Designer: hang on, Oh we haven't heard. {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Uh-huh.
Marketing: um it's uh {disfmarker} the average evaluation score is one point eight eight, so it means w you know, I can I can spell it out. There were six true or ones, four um pardon me, two s almost true or close to true, so that was four points, and then uh one false, seven points, so seventeen divided by nine {disfmarker} we're between one and two. I would say that's ex excellent in terms of uh ho how much we adhere to the ideals of the uh market place.
User Interface: Yeah. And the the only false one is because we've chosen to keep a simple old technology,
Marketing: To maintain old technology, exactly.
Industrial Designer: Mm-hmm.
User Interface: which if it works perfectly well I see no point in improving on if it works,
Marketing: Yeah, yeah.
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} Absolutely, and it's kept us within budget.
User Interface: so. Yeah.
Marketing: Yes.
Project Manager: Mm-hmm.
User Interface: So we do count as I think excellent or one.
Project Manager: Alright.
User Interface: {gap}.
Project Manager: And we've therefore {disfmarker} we have to do the final questionnaire and do the meeting summary, I have a final report to present, um and then we're done.
Marketing: Okay.
Project Manager: We done good, and we're finished in time.
User Interface: Bring on the ice sculptures.
Marketing: Nice.
Industrial Designer: And then we get the product launch party.
Marketing: So we might have to wait.
Industrial Designer: Product launch party?
User Interface: Yeah.
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
User Interface: That's what I said, ice sculptures.
Marketing: Yeah.
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} Absolutely. {vocalsound}
Marketing: Um I {disfmarker} one thing I want to do is {disfmarker} oh, I think the meeting's done.
Project Manager: I believe that is the end of our meeting. Thank you, Melissa. {vocalsound}
Marketing: Yeah. Um one thing I wa I wanna do is save everything in the right files, because I don't think everything is saved. The right files. Final meeting market","The group made an interactive evaluation of the remote control in terms of the user requirements and the trends. They mainly focused on the evaluation of price, fancy, color and energy. They picked another word, elegant, other than fancy to describe to design of the new remote control. The group failed to make a choice between the shape of banana and chunk, but they reached a consensus to use kinetic as the source of energy.",qmsum
"What did the team think about having buttons for multiple operations in the discussion of functions of the remote?
Project Manager: Okay, is everybody ready?
Industrial Designer: Yeah?
Marketing: Yeah I'd to just put on my microphone here and I'll be right with you.
Project Manager: Mm-hmm.
Marketing: Okay?
Project Manager: Um {vocalsound} I take it you all have received instructions as to what you were supposed to do
Industrial Designer: Mm?
User Interface: Yes.
Project Manager: and um I think the Marketing Manager probably should go first, addressing the needs and desires.
Marketing: {vocalsound} Okay you want me to start right now?
Project Manager: Yeah, mm-hmm.
Marketing: Okay.
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
Marketing: Well, could you um put my slides up'cause I think it might be helpful if uh we looked at the slides at the same time.
Project Manager: Okay. You're participant four.
Marketing: I'm participant four I believe. Yes uh-huh.
Project Manager: Okay, and now I can uh full screen.
Marketing:'Kay.
Industrial Designer: Open.
Project Manager: Uh, okay, okay.
Marketing: There we go. Okay well I think we have introduced ourselves,
Industrial Designer: And then full screen.
Marketing: so the functional requirements are {disfmarker} is {vocalsound} is part of my goal but why don't we pass right to the second slide. Cause that's where m my discussion starts. Right well um since I'm in charge of trying to figure out what we should put on this thing since I have to try to sell it.
Industrial Designer: Mm-hmm.
Marketing: Um {vocalsound} I thought that the method I should follow would be gather suggestions from everybody, and th the reason I just put that there like that is that uh in the init in the initial stage I think I should just be open to lots of suggestions. You know you can say anything you want no matter how silly it sounds you know it should run your car, it should heat up your motor if should um turn on your C_D_ {vocalsound} whatever you want it to do {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer:'Kay.
Marketing: um and then as we go on what we'll have to do is accept and eliminate these suggestions according to um design and budget feasibility. So I'll be coming to you um frequently as the Industrial Expert to tell me how hard it's gonna be to add a feature or how expensive it's gonna be or if your time, if it takes five years to develop this it's just something we can't do.
Industrial Designer: Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Hmm hmm. Mm.
Marketing: So in the beginning just have a big puddle of things that we {disfmarker} anybody can th throw anything in
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
Marketing: and then just weed things out that can't be done for one reason or another, and then the things that seem the most attractive that to uh to a customer we'll try to then prioritise those.
Industrial Designer: Mm-hmm. Yeah.
Marketing: So that was um what I meant there, and as I said on the slide there consulting the Industrial Engineer about that and the other thing is timing is really gonna be as important as money, because if we're gonna sell this thing, I think the best time to sell it is as a Christmas present. Twenty five Euros makes a nice little present, and we want it to be an impulse purchase,
Industrial Designer: Mm.
Marketing: we want somebody to see it and think it's, gee I just gotta have that. And take out their wallet and buy it. So it's gotta be really attractive and it {disfmarker} but it's gotta go to market by September,'cause anything that you don't already have out there in September showing it around, isn't gonna sell for Christmas.
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
Marketing: Um {vocalsound} and then I'll be coming to you as the User Interface person to try to tell me from your point of view what are the most friendly features that we could put on it and try to prior help me with that prioritising of uh of the features and of the the look and the colour
User Interface: Okay.
Marketing: and I'll be coming back to you to help weed out those suggestions from that point of view.
User Interface: Okay.
Marketing: So I'll be coming to you for how much is it gonna cost us and how long is it gonna take you,
Industrial Designer: Mm mm-hmm.
Marketing: and I'll be coming to you to tell me what's gonna make somebody take out their wallet you know,
User Interface: What features.
Marketing: what what's what's gonna really be what they call a sizzle,
User Interface: S sellable. Yes {vocalsound}.
Marketing:'cause we gotta sell this sizzle {vocalsound}.
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Marketing: A lot of times the thing that works the best from an engineering point of view isn't the thing that somebody's really just gonna take out their wallet and buy for Christmas for for their child or for their husband or whatever.
User Interface: Yes.
Marketing: Okay can we go to the next slide please? Alright I I already did a little bit of research after our first meeting where we threw out some ideas and it looks to me that within the budget that we're looking at the uh the whole house idea really isn't gonna be possible. So I'd like your suggestions to come back to the other slide where I was saying we we could suggest anything.
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
Marketing: I'd like the suggestions to be really specific, so that we'll have a list of things we can cross off, not something like you know whole house control what'll be {vocalsound} {disfmarker} And then I found on the internet from from my research that some extended electronic entertainment control should be possible. At the budget that we're looking at and at the price point we're looking at, we should be able to make it work the T_V_, the V_C_R_, the stereo set um maybe something else cute like a coffee pot or one other appliance or maybe a lamp.
Project Manager: {vocalsound} Uh okay, can can I at this point interject um something?
Marketing: I have to wind up? Yeah, sure.
Project Manager: Um we have received instruction from higher up that certain things should not be uh considered. Um the one thing for example {disfmarker} something to eliminate maybe that's the teletext,
Marketing: Okay.
Project Manager: because that's sort of outdated with the internet,
Industrial Designer: Mm-hmm.
Marketing: Okay.
Project Manager: and according to to higher management the {disfmarker} it should only control the T_V_,
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: mostly because they feel that it's too comp complex a task to um to to include other things,
Industrial Designer: Complicated, yeah, of course.
Project Manager: and they are concerned with the time to market.
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
Marketing: Of course, yeah.
Project Manager: Okay.
User Interface: Okay.
Project Manager: Um and the {disfmarker}
Marketing: Okay, so that's something {disfmarker}
Project Manager: and the third thing that they wanna make sure um that their {disfmarker} that the corporate image is being maintained, and that the corporate colour and design are being used on the product, so that it's easy that that that they can be easily identified as a product of of of the company, and that there's no mistake that it could be somebody else who is bringing this out.
Industrial Designer: Mm-hmm.
Project Manager: So I just wanted to interject this here so we're not getting too much off track here with uh with the things we wanna look at. These were instructions from higher up so we have to eliminate uh these things, so it's only gonna be T_V_,
Marketing: Okay so {disfmarker}
Project Manager: but the one thing maybe that could be um eliminated is the teletext uh idea.
Marketing: Okay.
Project Manager: Mm'kay.
User Interface: Okay.
Marketing: Alright, thanks for that. Um alright now {vocalsound} other things that I found out on {disfmarker} in my research is that the complaints that people have about the remote controls that are out there now.'Cause a lot of them take too much time to learn how to use, and that was thirty four percent but even more important the thing that we did address in our last meeting that frequently it's lost somewhere in the room. Um so those are two things that we definitely do wanna address, uh we wanna s make it as simple as possible, we wanna make it um obvious and intuitive to use, and then the things about finding it we talked about the {disfmarker} a light emitting thing as well as uh maybe a beep, and I think that those are things after my research that we definitely wanna try to incorporate.'Kay can we go to the next slide please? Okay, so, my personal preferences in this um project are really have to concentrate on the sizzle. That is the selling point, the thing that's gonna make it an impulse purchase. Uh because once there's no be-back, well in sales they always say you know, be-backs don't come back.
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Marketing: If somebody says, oh I'll come back and get it next week you're dead. They're never gonna come back and buy it. You've gotta make it attractive enough so they buy it now now now w now is a big word in in my book for selling this thing. And, in order to make it really sellable we've gotta shorten the learning curve, make sure it's really intuitive and easy to use. We have to have as few buttons as possible, because more buttons is more confusion, so that's why I'm saying, simplicity is good. Finding it's important, obviously you can't use it if you can't find it. So we've gotta concentrate on the features that help you find it, and I've already said this several times but I put it down in writing here, it should be an attractive impulse purchase at twenty five Euros. So it has to have enough value that when somebody looks at it they say, uh twenty five Euros I'm not gonna take that. Has to be so great that they're gonna say, uh twenty five Euros isn't much. Um and then maybe a motto, like we put fashion in electronics might be something we can use in our marketing campaign.
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
Marketing: Okay that's uh about it for me right now.
Project Manager: {vocalsound} Okay. And uh who would be next, uh, I guess that would be you. Mm-hmm.
Industrial Designer: Yeah'kay.
Project Manager: You want me to get your slide show up?
Industrial Designer: Yeah yeah sure.
Project Manager: Mm-hmm.
Industrial Designer: Thank you.
Project Manager: And you are number three?
Industrial Designer: Number two,
Project Manager: Number two.
Industrial Designer: yeah. Yeah exactly.
Project Manager: Okay. Okay.
Industrial Designer: Uh can you make it uh full screen please?
Project Manager: Mm-hmm. Yep.
Industrial Designer: No, it's like a well you you have to press here. The cup cup shape here?
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Yeah yeah, uh-huh.
Industrial Designer: The thir third.
Project Manager: There, mm-hmm.
Industrial Designer: Yeah exactly. Uh so today I'm going to talk about the working design of the remote controller. Um can you go to the next sli slide please?
Marketing: Okay.
Project Manager: Mm-hmm.
Industrial Designer: The metal is like uh in a remote controller you have a chip integrated circuit which is like a brain of the remote controller. It takes the power from a battery say a battery it it can be a elec an electric supply like you have to uh like uh switch connec connect connect your remote controller to uh power supply from the you know electricity or something like that. It should be a battery because uh uh remote controller should be like you you you should take it t to wherever you want and then um uh th
Marketing: Mm-hmm.
Industrial Designer: this integrated circuitry takes energy from the power source and whatever like if you press a button it's like a input for the remote controller and it takes the input and it it transforms into a infro infrared bits and it sends it into the device, like a T_V_ or a air conditioner, something like that so. Uh a remote controller is specifically designed to a single device. If you want to design it for multiple devices then you should make all the devices compatible with the frequency like uh th the remote controller it sends some bits some uh waves like with a particular frequency the device should know what the frequency is. It should re re recognise the uh waves which are coming from the remote controller and it should take the action like if you press a button channel or something like that then uh the remote uh remote controller will send a send a se {vocalsound} send a signal,
Marketing: {vocalsound} Signal.
Industrial Designer: and the T_V_ it should translate that into like change the channel or something like that, change the volume control
User Interface: Receive.
Marketing: Mm-hmm.
Project Manager: Mm-hmm.
Industrial Designer: and uh so uh I think it's hard to design a remote controller for multiple uh devices.
User Interface: Multi-purpose.
Project Manager: Yo and it's {disfmarker}
Marketing: Yeah well that's already been eliminated by management, so we're off the hook {vocalsound}.
Project Manager: yeah {disfmarker} but it's so {vocalsound}.
Industrial Designer: Uh yeah. {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Yep.
Industrial Designer: Um. So uh user interface controls the chip and accordingly the messages like there should be a user user in interface like you know switch pad or something like that buttons should be there. So uh you can control whatever you want, you want to change the channel you want to control the volume you you want to uh mute uh mute the uh T_V_ or you want to have a child lock or you want to do some operations there's a {disfmarker} there should be some device to tell what to do to the uh in uh integrated circuit so that the integrated circuit can s send the signals and T_V_ can perform the actions.
Marketing: Mm okay.
Industrial Designer: So can you go to the next slide please?
Marketing: Okay.
Industrial Designer: So I I just would like to uh add some extra features to the remote controller um I think these are the very simple features and uh they don't take much uh uh much of the um um investment also,
Marketing: Mm-hmm.
Industrial Designer: it's like el the text or buttons which uh which are there on the uh remote controller they {disfmarker} those we can make uh um like fluorescent uh they'll be like light emitting if it is dark so that you can find your remote controller if it is dark.
Marketing: Mm-hmm.
Industrial Designer: And ther there should be a beep if many buttons are pressed if suppose a child is playing with the remote controller and a and she she or he is pressing the buttons all at the time then there should be a beep saying that it's {disfmarker} this this is not a a you know a a action, there can be no action taking to that so. And there should be a child lock, like uh uh you should be able to lock your remote controller so that uh um whatever buttons are pressed by a child they can't be like y you i you if you have ki kids and all then they'll be pl playing with the remote controllers so can lock the remote controller. If make it useable for more than one device it's a it's hard but I think it's possible
Project Manager: Yeah well {disfmarker} yeah well that has been e that has been eliminated, so that's that's unfortunately a moot point now. Mm-hmm.
Industrial Designer: but it uh
Marketing: Well we already eliminated that.
Industrial Designer: yeah yeah yeah
User Interface: Eliminated.
Industrial Designer: so it's it's okay, yeah, yeah. And uh different shapes that we can do like uh we can have you know a all animals shapes or you know comfortable uh whi which can fit into your hands
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: and um so that uh {disfmarker}
Marketing: Now that's good from a marketing point of view, the fun {disfmarker} the fun shape.
Industrial Designer: Yeah, yeah, yeah and colours also, different colours, and {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Yeah I {disfmarker}
User Interface: Mm-hmm colours.
Marketing: And that {disfmarker} you you say that won't add too much to the budget?
Industrial Designer: No no no, it won't uh I don't think it will be like,
Marketing: To d the shape is uh {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: you can have you know for uh if you want ther there to be more {disfmarker}
Project Manager: It just build a mould basically and uh you know.
Industrial Designer: Yeah yeah.
User Interface: Yes exactly.
Industrial Designer: It's it's just a s shape so it doesn't matter.
Project Manager: As the budget we're looking at if you build one mould I don't think that's going to make a big difference whether it's gonna be square or {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
Marketing: Do you think there's any chance of um having ser in {disfmarker} having basically the same machine with the same buttons but maybe several different shapes?
Industrial Designer: Yeah that is also possible I uh yeah I I yeah.
Project Manager: Oh yes.
Marketing: Is that gonna be a possible?
User Interface: Yes.
Project Manager: I think {disfmarker}
Marketing:'Cause that might help with the marketing.
Project Manager: I think we will have to look at the budget on that
Industrial Designer: Yeah that will be {disfmarker}
Project Manager: but I think in principle that that would be {disfmarker} that would be kind of fun, you know.
Industrial Designer: Yeah yeah.
Marketing: Because we had something sort of sexy for adults and we could have something sort of
Industrial Designer: Mm-hmm.
Project Manager: Yeah.
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Silly for children.
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: Yeah, for children, yeah exactly.
Marketing: silly for children
Project Manager: Like an animal or {disfmarker}
Marketing: or a little animal shape or in a {disfmarker} or a little elephant so they can remember where it is. {vocalsound}
User Interface: Like a doll, or {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Yeah, that's what, yeah.
Project Manager: Yeah.
Industrial Designer: Yeah, exactly. Yeah.
User Interface: Yes {vocalsound}.
Industrial Designer: And and the butto buttons also I think if you want to have more features in your remote controller then there should be more buttons. If there are more buttons then it will be more complicated. If you have less features then your remote controller won't be attractive, so I think uh we need to make some buttons which are {disfmarker} which are like um uh f in uh in intended for two or three operations, like if you press one button in one mode then it will change the channel, if you press the other button in another mode it will change the colour. So if you want to have less buttons we can have that option but I think it will complicate the matter more I think so.
Marketing: Mm. Well, I think {disfmarker} I think that that's something that we'll have to discuss um with the User Interface person
User Interface: Yes.
Industrial Designer: Yep, yeah.
Marketing: because I think there's a lot of argument to be made for one button for one feature. Because I think one of the things were complaining about in my {disfmarker} what I found out in my research is when they complained about how hard it is to learn a new one.
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: Mm-hmm.
Marketing: The changing modes was something {vocalsound} {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Yeah, it's like you know {vocalsound} yeah.
Marketing: I mean you and I, all f all four of us we work with computers all the time,
Industrial Designer: Yeah. Yeah, yeah.
User Interface: Okay.
Marketing: changing modes is nothing for us, but people who {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Yeah, a little elderly, a little arthritic hand you know,
Marketing: {vocalsound} N and {disfmarker}
Project Manager: and and it's a small button and and it {disfmarker} they don't press it exactly
Industrial Designer: Mm-hmm. Yeah.
Project Manager: you know something else happens n not their favourite channel comes up but something else
Industrial Designer: Yeah, yes.
Project Manager: and they're very frustrated you know.
User Interface: Something else.
Marketing: And that's {disfmarker} and that's the kind of thing people learn by feel, and um {vocalsound} you don't feel the mode change.
Industrial Designer: Yeah, yeah you don't {vocalsound} us yeah yeah, usually. Yeah.
Marketing: {vocalsound} So um maybe having buttons be various shapes might be a help too.
Industrial Designer: Yeah shapes also, different shapes.
Marketing: You know, like the {disfmarker} a triangle is for the volume and a square is for changing channels, so that people can uh develop a tactile sense of it.
Industrial Designer: Yeah that will {disfmarker} Mm-hmm.
User Interface: Channels.
Industrial Designer: Yeah. Yeah.
Project Manager: Mm, mm-hmm.
Industrial Designer: Yeah,
Marketing: But we'll get to that with you.
User Interface: Yes.
Industrial Designer: yeah, and also text should be very clear so that there there won't be any ambiguities and uh {disfmarker}
Marketing: That's right, yeah. Now that's a good point. Yeah.
User Interface: Yes.
Industrial Designer: So yeah.
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: And uh display clock i if you want more features then we can display a clock it I I don't think it will take any money extra money because anyway we have an integrated circuit I think we can just definitely fit that feature into the circuit so it's {disfmarker}
Marketing: Yeah, that's that's a good {disfmarker} that's a good one,
Project Manager: Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.
User Interface: Mm yeah.
Industrial Designer: Yeah, and we display a clock.
Marketing: because the clock would be really friendly,
Project Manager: Yes.
Marketing: and and when is your favourite show coming on
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
Project Manager: Yes.
Industrial Designer: Yeah, and then you can just see your remote controller yeah yeah yeah so {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Yeah you're sitting there already or maybe you have no other uh {disfmarker}
User Interface: Yes {gap}.
Marketing: {vocalsound} and {vocalsound} {disfmarker} Yeah, and a lot of time there's not a clock on the screen, and you have to go somewhere but you just wanna look at the news for a minute.
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
Marketing: Yeah that's that's good, the clock is good.
Project Manager: {vocalsound} Mm-hmm.
Industrial Designer: Yeah. Uh can you go to the next slide please?
Marketing: Okay.
Industrial Designer: Uh components uh the main components we need for uh it ha like buttons and uh underneath that there should be switch. And uh bulbs. Like uh we can have a bulb like whenever we are operating a remote controller or uh whenever the T_V_ is on suppose,
User Interface: Hmm.
Industrial Designer: then the remote controller should automatically have a b s light.
Marketing: Mm-hmm.
Industrial Designer: Then it will be like if you switch on your T_V_ through anoth another source, not from {disfmarker} through a remote remote controller and you you lost your remote controller maybe you can find with the light.
Marketing: Mm-hmm.
Industrial Designer: Maybe we can have that. Whenever the T_V_ is on, remote controller will have a light.
Marketing: Mm-hmm.
Industrial Designer: And then uh infrared bulbs. Um this is like uh when it is dark.
Marketing: Mm-hmm.
Project Manager: Yeah, mm-hmm.
Industrial Designer: And battery, there should be a battery for power supply,
Marketing: Mm-hmm.
Industrial Designer: and a chip,
Marketing: Mm-hmm.
Industrial Designer: chip which is like a brain to the remote controller which does all the operations,
Project Manager: Mm-hmm.
Industrial Designer: and wires connecting all chips, which is uh lights, everything,
Project Manager: Yeah.
User Interface: Okay.
Industrial Designer: so there should be wires. And uh uh of course there should be a case where we can keep all the things and, you know different shapes or whatever it is there should be a case to put to give a shape.
User Interface: To keep the remote? Yeah.
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
Marketing: Case.
User Interface: A case holder. A holder {disfmarker} remote holder.
Industrial Designer: Yeah, holder.
Project Manager: Holder, yeah, mm-hmm.
Industrial Designer: Um uh can you move onto the next slide. Um next sli slide please. Um I have referred the site uh the homepage of the um our website, uh from where I have uh uh I got s few points.
Project Manager: Mm-hmm.
Industrial Designer: That's it, that's it from me now.
Project Manager: Okay.
Marketing: So it {disfmarker} um we should visit this site and have a look at uh what's up there? Or {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} Um.
Project Manager: Well, you don't have to.
Industrial Designer: Uh it's not like that, I have referred the page to get new ideas or like what can be the working design to how it works and all and so and so.
Marketing: Okay. Okay. So it might be helpful if we had a look at that.
Industrial Designer: Yeah if you want. Yeah, it's okay.
Marketing: Okay, thank you. Could you go back to that slide where she had that uh s slide up Betsy?
Industrial Designer: Uh, it's actually there now, there on the screen.
Project Manager: This one?
Marketing: Yeah, okay, thank you.
Project Manager: And Francine?
User Interface: Participant two.
Project Manager: You are number two?
User Interface: Yes. No no, I'm three.
Project Manager: You're three. Would you want it full full screen?
User Interface: I can make it full? Yes yes yes.
Project Manager: Mm-hmm? Okay.
User Interface: Okay. As uh User Interface Designer I did a little research to find out what are the features which a user would like to have on their remote.
Project Manager: Mm-hmm.
User Interface: Yeah can you please go onto the next slide?
Project Manager: Mm-hmm.
User Interface: So I found out that uh but uh the main purpose of a remote is to uh f control the function of a television at a far off distance at remote distance. Now for that, uh a remote controller should have a switch on off button by which a user can sit anywhere in the room in front of the T_V_ and he can control the functionalities different functionalities of the T_V_.
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Mm-hmm.
User Interface: There should be a signal uh something like a radio wave or a infrared light or a LED which can be used to change the different functionalities in the television if the user wants to uh change the channels or increase the volume he can change it.
Marketing: Mm-hmm.
User Interface: Now there should be some timer to set for viewing a particular a particular programme or switching on and off a uh a particular programme according to the user choice.
Project Manager: On the on on the remote. Yeah, mm-hmm.
User Interface: Yes. Yes. So if if he want to view a particular programme at say nine o'clock he can set the time, and the T_V_ will automatically it will switch on at that particular time.
Project Manager: Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Right. Mm-hmm.
User Interface: So he can use that kind of uh uh properties of features and then there should be a child lock system if a particular channel is not to be viewed by a particular uh for a certain age, then the parents can lock that particular channel so that the ch children cannot view that channel.
Project Manager: Yes. By your child, mm-hmm.
Marketing: Mm-hmm.
Project Manager: Mm-hmm.
User Interface: And uh the uh the uh and the {disfmarker} one of the feature a user would like to have is the compactness of the co remote.
Project Manager: Mm-hmm.
Marketing: Mm-hmm.
User Interface: Uh t the remote should be compact and it should ha it should have as many buttons as possible for controlling different functionalities of the T_V_ television. And um uh as uh uh this is my personal preference that it should be in the shape of a T_ in alphabet for more compactability.
Project Manager: Mm-hmm.
User Interface: And uh and uh and it is one more point which I noted it down, like uh the material which which which is used for remotes should be human friendly it should not cause any skin disease or something some al allergy to either children or to um ad adult person.
Project Manager: Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.
Marketing: Mm,'kay.
Project Manager: Mm-hmm.
User Interface: And it should have an uh it can have an alarm clock a a person if some if somebody wants to get up at around eight eight P_M_ then he can set the time and it can be used as an alarm clock,
Industrial Designer: Mm.
Project Manager: Mm-hmm.
User Interface: and I don't think it will cost much to set an alarm clock inside a remote.
Industrial Designer: Yeah, sure.
Project Manager: Mm-hmm.
Industrial Designer: If there is a clock then there can be a alarm clock.
User Interface: Yes,
Marketing: And an alarm clock, yeah that should {disfmarker} that should be okay.
User Interface: and as John Reece said the buttons can be, uh can me we can use the fluorescence to light up the buttons so different uh buttons will glow differently. So in even in the dark the user can know what buttons to use to switch on a particular channel. And uh uh the design of the uh um remote should be in such a way that there should not be any sharp projections so that if a child plays with a remote, he uh he should not be harmed in any way.
Industrial Designer: Hmm.
User Interface: And findings, uh I found out uh y um on different sites that uh there are different remotes which can be used, there are remotes which use the infrared for controlling the different functionalities, there are remotes which use the radio waves to control the functions and there are uh {disfmarker} So uh there you have different uh types of remotes for different light source which are used {disfmarker} which can be used for controlling the different functionalities of a television. Next slide. And these are my few personal preferences like it can be used for a multipurpose use. Not, uh no uh like it can {disfmarker} it can be used as a T_V_ control as plus an alarm clock to set an alarm a timing and it should have a child lock, and then to save electricity uh there should not be uh much s move uh lots of circuits and all that. And if a person if if if parents wants the television to be switched off by ten o'clock then it should be switched off ten o at ten o'clock automatically, so that nobody else comes later and use it.
Industrial Designer: It's like a t okay, it's like a timer {gap} it's like a lock to the television.
Project Manager: Timer, yeah, mm-hmm, mm-hmm.
User Interface: Timer. Yeah and then you can use a timer as well. Yes. Yeah that's it.
Project Manager: Uh okay, now I have {disfmarker} On my slide show basically we already {disfmarker} we have already done the agenda, and uh on the closing uh basically there will be lunch break and all that. However uh the decision we have to take in this meeting is who is our target group. And uh what function, working design, how how does it work.
User Interface: {vocalsound} Okay.
Project Manager: So these are the two things we should come up wit with. So uh the first thing is pro maybe a little easier on uh who is our target group. Um. I guess in many ways everybody. Everybody who has a T_V_.
Industrial Designer: Mm, T_V_, yeah.
User Interface: T_V_ television we was.
Project Manager: Yeah, and I think today there are probably not many people who don't have a T_V_.
Industrial Designer: Don't T_V_, yeah.
Project Manager: There are a few but in general not. {vocalsound} Now, talking about the target group which is in a sense everybody, but I think within the target group we have subgroups. We have {disfmarker} we have earlier it was mentioned about um for example elderly people who have limited function with their fingers and hands,
User Interface: Mm-hmm.
Project Manager: so I think that's uh one group that's certainly important.
Industrial Designer: Hmm.
Project Manager: Um then we have just the nervous people who can never press a little button on anything um unless it's really very clear.
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
Project Manager: And uh I don't know how much we want to cater to children's use. I mean that's a question um whether that's important that children can really use it or not.
Industrial Designer: Mm.
Project Manager: So this {disfmarker} these are just some thoughts I have on it, and um I dunno what you feel about whether we can just say we have one target group and for this one target group we're gonna design this one thing {vocalsound}
Marketing: Mm-hmm.
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
Project Manager: or whether we're looking at what we like we we talking about different shapes, whether that different shape also includes maybe different uh buttons uh for different groups.
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Marketing: Mm-hmm.
Industrial Designer: Mm-hmm.
Marketing: Mm-hmm. Well you know there's the old motto, children under six never shop alone.
Project Manager: Mm-hmm.
Marketing: So if you've designed something that's very attractive to children um the mummy please mummy please um you know we want it now we wanna go to the store and see it um that has uh a lot of marketing pull.
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: {vocalsound} That has a lot of {disfmarker} that has a lot of appeal but I think uh I'm I'm talking about the functionality now on it whether we're looking at different groups.
Industrial Designer: Mm.
Project Manager: I think the children issue can be addressed with the shape and with colours.
Marketing: Mm-hmm.
Project Manager: You know, like you make it nice and pink, fluorescent, banana colour or whatever {vocalsound} you know
User Interface: Different colours.
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
Marketing: That's right.
User Interface: Yes.
Marketing: You can make a banana shaped one. {vocalsound}
Project Manager: yeah, for example you know.
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: Yeah. Mm.
Project Manager: But the question is really, who is our target group.
Marketing: Mm-hmm.
Project Manager: {vocalsound} Do we look at one target group? {vocalsound} And with the twenty five Euros you know can we can we afford to have uh I'm asking the technical people here whether um to look at sort of subgroups with maybe different buttons for each group how much would that throw us out of the cost we are supposed to respect?
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Marketing: Respect. Mm.
User Interface: Okay. No uh generally we can we can design a remote which is mainly for people with uh f age from ten to um forty
Project Manager: Right.
User Interface: and and then we can add on uh specific functional buttons for children as well as the elderly people or the people wit with who have nervous problems, yes.
Project Manager: With with {disfmarker} Mm-hmm.
Industrial Designer: We can design different remotes for different people, like for aged people there will be big buttons and you know.
Project Manager: Well that's that's {disfmarker}
User Interface: But in a family {disfmarker} in a family there will be a aged person, children and a middle aged but they cannot buy three different remotes.
Industrial Designer: {gap} yeah. Children and everybody, yeah.
User Interface: They would like to buy just one and um just one which can be used all the three uh {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Yeah of course that we can do, but specifically if y if like elderly people want big buttons then you can't really make a bi big remote controller so maybe specifically you can design a big con remote controller for elderly and for children, like in a different you know.
Marketing: What about the electronics? That's not really gonna change much, is it?
Project Manager: Yeah.
User Interface: Cost effective.
Industrial Designer: No, it it doesn't cost, yeah.
Project Manager: No {vocalsound}
Marketing: That {vocalsound} that w that won't change much, will it uh?
Industrial Designer: Yeah. Doesn't doesn't doesn't matter.
Project Manager: {vocalsound} The the quest the question to be addressed here is only who is the target group and how will it function,
Marketing: I d I wouldn't think so.
Project Manager: and I think the how will it function is probably the question of the buttons you know, within the target group or subgroups.
Marketing: Mm-hmm. Yeah.
Project Manager: The question is only whether our budget will allow to have more than one design in a sense. I mean the basic design I understand will be the same,
Marketing: Yeah.
Project Manager: but the question is how much will that set us back if let's say {vocalsound} uh forty percent we make large buttons and the rest we make regular buttons for example.
User Interface: Okay.
Industrial Designer: Yeah. {vocalsound}
Marketing: Yeah.
Project Manager: So that remains to s to be seen but {vocalsound} uh the target group as a whole is is basically everybody with a T_V_.
Marketing: That's right,
User Interface: Yes.
Marketing: and can we {disfmarker} can we is it even feasible to make one one remote control with something for everyone, or would we have to use the same electronics and make three different shapes?
Project Manager: Yeah, well that's that's the question.
Marketing: Um the same electronics and basically all that's gonna be different is the plastic case.
Industrial Designer: Hmm hmm.
Marketing: And in that case we could probabl moulded plastic isn't all that expensive is it?
Industrial Designer: Uh no. Mm, I I I don't think no. It's not.
Marketing: Um you as an industrial person?
Project Manager: Well maybe there's {disfmarker} there's an idea you know t the new for example new portable phones?
Marketing: Mm-hmm.
Project Manager: They have like removable plastic cases, so you can have a striped one or you can have a fluorescent blue one, or whatever,
Marketing: Yeah. Mm-hmm.
Project Manager: and maybe something like that,
User Interface: Okay.
Project Manager: that in each package you know you have {disfmarker} you you have {disfmarker} you have for example uh {vocalsound} you have let's say a fluorescent blue on it but then you have uh another colour or stripe whatever that already comes in a package.
Marketing: Well there's a real idea yeah. Mm-hmm.
Industrial Designer: Hmm.
Project Manager: And then if people really want more colours they can buy it separately.
Marketing: Yeah.
Project Manager: You know,
Industrial Designer: Yeah, like for mobile phones we have uh different you know covers, like designs and all so that w we can have that.
Marketing: Right.
User Interface: Um {disfmarker}
Project Manager: yes.
Marketing: Mm-hmm.
Project Manager: That's right,
User Interface: Yes.
Project Manager: and {disfmarker} but like if if then everybody is is is tired of the fluorescent blue and of the striped or whatever they have as another one in the package,
Marketing: Uh yeah.
Project Manager: then they can go to the store and for a few uh Francs or Euros whatever they can buy
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
Marketing: An alternate package.
Project Manager: an alternate package with another two colours in it you know for example you know.
Marketing: Yeah. Okay.
User Interface: But uh yeah I I have a doubt like will it be cost wise effective if we {disfmarker} if we design a remote having all the uh different features for different people or designing three different um remotes for three different categories of people.
Project Manager: Well I think {disfmarker} I think the idea here is to uh to to d design one remote
Industrial Designer: Yeah, but uh {disfmarker}
Marketing: Well I think we can only aff {gap}, yeah.
User Interface: Okay.
Project Manager: and what the only change is gonna be um
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
Project Manager: the funct d t yeah uh {vocalsound}
Marketing: Cosmetic.
User Interface: Of th okay.
Project Manager: the functional {vocalsound} functional cosmetics if you want to put it that way,
User Interface: Okay.
Project Manager: um having maybe larger buttons or buttons that light up or buttons that are slightly differently shaped for people uh either for children um {disfmarker}
User Interface: Mm-hmm.
Project Manager: Five minutes that was I guess tha that's the old message.
Marketing: Warning, finish meeting now. {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Finish meeting now. Um um.
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Marketing: Well we may have to come back to one or two of these points at our next meeting but um {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Yeah, maybe, yeah, yeah.
Project Manager: But I think {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: If we do some more research, maybe we {gap}.
Project Manager: I I think to sum it up the target group is basically everybody. If money permits we can address some features for some subgroups within that.
User Interface: Okay,
Marketing: Mm-hmm.
User Interface: mm-hmm.
Industrial Designer: Hmm yeah,
Project Manager: Do we agree, do we?
Industrial Designer: I think maybe seventy percent is a unique uh uh remote controller and thirty percent is yeah it's sort of like {disfmarker} yeah.
Marketing: Okay but we have to l
Project Manager: Do we agree on on that in principle, like money will tell whether we will be able to do that or not.
Industrial Designer: Yeah, yeah, of course, yeah.
User Interface: Yes.
Marketing: Okay, fair enough.
Project Manager: {vocalsound} Okay? So now I understand it's lunch break.
Industrial Designer: Mm-hmm.
Project Manager: And um. So that's what we will do.
Marketing: Okay.
User Interface: Okay.
Project Manager: So hank you very much.
Industrial Designer: Thank you.
Project Manager: And we'll see you after lunch.",Marketing said that there is a lot of argument to make one button for one feature because research results show that users complain about how hard it is to learn a new one. This idea might be suitable for people working with computers all the time but the elderly with an arthritic hand might find it difficult. User Interface suggested that it should have as many buttons as possible for controlling different functionalities and be in the shape of the letter T for more compatibility.,qmsum
"What is the product positioning of the remote?
Project Manager: Okay, is everybody ready?
Industrial Designer: Yeah?
Marketing: Yeah I'd to just put on my microphone here and I'll be right with you.
Project Manager: Mm-hmm.
Marketing: Okay?
Project Manager: Um {vocalsound} I take it you all have received instructions as to what you were supposed to do
Industrial Designer: Mm?
User Interface: Yes.
Project Manager: and um I think the Marketing Manager probably should go first, addressing the needs and desires.
Marketing: {vocalsound} Okay you want me to start right now?
Project Manager: Yeah, mm-hmm.
Marketing: Okay.
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
Marketing: Well, could you um put my slides up'cause I think it might be helpful if uh we looked at the slides at the same time.
Project Manager: Okay. You're participant four.
Marketing: I'm participant four I believe. Yes uh-huh.
Project Manager: Okay, and now I can uh full screen.
Marketing:'Kay.
Industrial Designer: Open.
Project Manager: Uh, okay, okay.
Marketing: There we go. Okay well I think we have introduced ourselves,
Industrial Designer: And then full screen.
Marketing: so the functional requirements are {disfmarker} is {vocalsound} is part of my goal but why don't we pass right to the second slide. Cause that's where m my discussion starts. Right well um since I'm in charge of trying to figure out what we should put on this thing since I have to try to sell it.
Industrial Designer: Mm-hmm.
Marketing: Um {vocalsound} I thought that the method I should follow would be gather suggestions from everybody, and th the reason I just put that there like that is that uh in the init in the initial stage I think I should just be open to lots of suggestions. You know you can say anything you want no matter how silly it sounds you know it should run your car, it should heat up your motor if should um turn on your C_D_ {vocalsound} whatever you want it to do {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer:'Kay.
Marketing: um and then as we go on what we'll have to do is accept and eliminate these suggestions according to um design and budget feasibility. So I'll be coming to you um frequently as the Industrial Expert to tell me how hard it's gonna be to add a feature or how expensive it's gonna be or if your time, if it takes five years to develop this it's just something we can't do.
Industrial Designer: Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Hmm hmm. Mm.
Marketing: So in the beginning just have a big puddle of things that we {disfmarker} anybody can th throw anything in
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
Marketing: and then just weed things out that can't be done for one reason or another, and then the things that seem the most attractive that to uh to a customer we'll try to then prioritise those.
Industrial Designer: Mm-hmm. Yeah.
Marketing: So that was um what I meant there, and as I said on the slide there consulting the Industrial Engineer about that and the other thing is timing is really gonna be as important as money, because if we're gonna sell this thing, I think the best time to sell it is as a Christmas present. Twenty five Euros makes a nice little present, and we want it to be an impulse purchase,
Industrial Designer: Mm.
Marketing: we want somebody to see it and think it's, gee I just gotta have that. And take out their wallet and buy it. So it's gotta be really attractive and it {disfmarker} but it's gotta go to market by September,'cause anything that you don't already have out there in September showing it around, isn't gonna sell for Christmas.
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
Marketing: Um {vocalsound} and then I'll be coming to you as the User Interface person to try to tell me from your point of view what are the most friendly features that we could put on it and try to prior help me with that prioritising of uh of the features and of the the look and the colour
User Interface: Okay.
Marketing: and I'll be coming back to you to help weed out those suggestions from that point of view.
User Interface: Okay.
Marketing: So I'll be coming to you for how much is it gonna cost us and how long is it gonna take you,
Industrial Designer: Mm mm-hmm.
Marketing: and I'll be coming to you to tell me what's gonna make somebody take out their wallet you know,
User Interface: What features.
Marketing: what what's what's gonna really be what they call a sizzle,
User Interface: S sellable. Yes {vocalsound}.
Marketing:'cause we gotta sell this sizzle {vocalsound}.
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Marketing: A lot of times the thing that works the best from an engineering point of view isn't the thing that somebody's really just gonna take out their wallet and buy for Christmas for for their child or for their husband or whatever.
User Interface: Yes.
Marketing: Okay can we go to the next slide please? Alright I I already did a little bit of research after our first meeting where we threw out some ideas and it looks to me that within the budget that we're looking at the uh the whole house idea really isn't gonna be possible. So I'd like your suggestions to come back to the other slide where I was saying we we could suggest anything.
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
Marketing: I'd like the suggestions to be really specific, so that we'll have a list of things we can cross off, not something like you know whole house control what'll be {vocalsound} {disfmarker} And then I found on the internet from from my research that some extended electronic entertainment control should be possible. At the budget that we're looking at and at the price point we're looking at, we should be able to make it work the T_V_, the V_C_R_, the stereo set um maybe something else cute like a coffee pot or one other appliance or maybe a lamp.
Project Manager: {vocalsound} Uh okay, can can I at this point interject um something?
Marketing: I have to wind up? Yeah, sure.
Project Manager: Um we have received instruction from higher up that certain things should not be uh considered. Um the one thing for example {disfmarker} something to eliminate maybe that's the teletext,
Marketing: Okay.
Project Manager: because that's sort of outdated with the internet,
Industrial Designer: Mm-hmm.
Marketing: Okay.
Project Manager: and according to to higher management the {disfmarker} it should only control the T_V_,
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: mostly because they feel that it's too comp complex a task to um to to include other things,
Industrial Designer: Complicated, yeah, of course.
Project Manager: and they are concerned with the time to market.
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
Marketing: Of course, yeah.
Project Manager: Okay.
User Interface: Okay.
Project Manager: Um and the {disfmarker}
Marketing: Okay, so that's something {disfmarker}
Project Manager: and the third thing that they wanna make sure um that their {disfmarker} that the corporate image is being maintained, and that the corporate colour and design are being used on the product, so that it's easy that that that they can be easily identified as a product of of of the company, and that there's no mistake that it could be somebody else who is bringing this out.
Industrial Designer: Mm-hmm.
Project Manager: So I just wanted to interject this here so we're not getting too much off track here with uh with the things we wanna look at. These were instructions from higher up so we have to eliminate uh these things, so it's only gonna be T_V_,
Marketing: Okay so {disfmarker}
Project Manager: but the one thing maybe that could be um eliminated is the teletext uh idea.
Marketing: Okay.
Project Manager: Mm'kay.
User Interface: Okay.
Marketing: Alright, thanks for that. Um alright now {vocalsound} other things that I found out on {disfmarker} in my research is that the complaints that people have about the remote controls that are out there now.'Cause a lot of them take too much time to learn how to use, and that was thirty four percent but even more important the thing that we did address in our last meeting that frequently it's lost somewhere in the room. Um so those are two things that we definitely do wanna address, uh we wanna s make it as simple as possible, we wanna make it um obvious and intuitive to use, and then the things about finding it we talked about the {disfmarker} a light emitting thing as well as uh maybe a beep, and I think that those are things after my research that we definitely wanna try to incorporate.'Kay can we go to the next slide please? Okay, so, my personal preferences in this um project are really have to concentrate on the sizzle. That is the selling point, the thing that's gonna make it an impulse purchase. Uh because once there's no be-back, well in sales they always say you know, be-backs don't come back.
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Marketing: If somebody says, oh I'll come back and get it next week you're dead. They're never gonna come back and buy it. You've gotta make it attractive enough so they buy it now now now w now is a big word in in my book for selling this thing. And, in order to make it really sellable we've gotta shorten the learning curve, make sure it's really intuitive and easy to use. We have to have as few buttons as possible, because more buttons is more confusion, so that's why I'm saying, simplicity is good. Finding it's important, obviously you can't use it if you can't find it. So we've gotta concentrate on the features that help you find it, and I've already said this several times but I put it down in writing here, it should be an attractive impulse purchase at twenty five Euros. So it has to have enough value that when somebody looks at it they say, uh twenty five Euros I'm not gonna take that. Has to be so great that they're gonna say, uh twenty five Euros isn't much. Um and then maybe a motto, like we put fashion in electronics might be something we can use in our marketing campaign.
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
Marketing: Okay that's uh about it for me right now.
Project Manager: {vocalsound} Okay. And uh who would be next, uh, I guess that would be you. Mm-hmm.
Industrial Designer: Yeah'kay.
Project Manager: You want me to get your slide show up?
Industrial Designer: Yeah yeah sure.
Project Manager: Mm-hmm.
Industrial Designer: Thank you.
Project Manager: And you are number three?
Industrial Designer: Number two,
Project Manager: Number two.
Industrial Designer: yeah. Yeah exactly.
Project Manager: Okay. Okay.
Industrial Designer: Uh can you make it uh full screen please?
Project Manager: Mm-hmm. Yep.
Industrial Designer: No, it's like a well you you have to press here. The cup cup shape here?
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Yeah yeah, uh-huh.
Industrial Designer: The thir third.
Project Manager: There, mm-hmm.
Industrial Designer: Yeah exactly. Uh so today I'm going to talk about the working design of the remote controller. Um can you go to the next sli slide please?
Marketing: Okay.
Project Manager: Mm-hmm.
Industrial Designer: The metal is like uh in a remote controller you have a chip integrated circuit which is like a brain of the remote controller. It takes the power from a battery say a battery it it can be a elec an electric supply like you have to uh like uh switch connec connect connect your remote controller to uh power supply from the you know electricity or something like that. It should be a battery because uh uh remote controller should be like you you you should take it t to wherever you want and then um uh th
Marketing: Mm-hmm.
Industrial Designer: this integrated circuitry takes energy from the power source and whatever like if you press a button it's like a input for the remote controller and it takes the input and it it transforms into a infro infrared bits and it sends it into the device, like a T_V_ or a air conditioner, something like that so. Uh a remote controller is specifically designed to a single device. If you want to design it for multiple devices then you should make all the devices compatible with the frequency like uh th the remote controller it sends some bits some uh waves like with a particular frequency the device should know what the frequency is. It should re re recognise the uh waves which are coming from the remote controller and it should take the action like if you press a button channel or something like that then uh the remote uh remote controller will send a send a se {vocalsound} send a signal,
Marketing: {vocalsound} Signal.
Industrial Designer: and the T_V_ it should translate that into like change the channel or something like that, change the volume control
User Interface: Receive.
Marketing: Mm-hmm.
Project Manager: Mm-hmm.
Industrial Designer: and uh so uh I think it's hard to design a remote controller for multiple uh devices.
User Interface: Multi-purpose.
Project Manager: Yo and it's {disfmarker}
Marketing: Yeah well that's already been eliminated by management, so we're off the hook {vocalsound}.
Project Manager: yeah {disfmarker} but it's so {vocalsound}.
Industrial Designer: Uh yeah. {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Yep.
Industrial Designer: Um. So uh user interface controls the chip and accordingly the messages like there should be a user user in interface like you know switch pad or something like that buttons should be there. So uh you can control whatever you want, you want to change the channel you want to control the volume you you want to uh mute uh mute the uh T_V_ or you want to have a child lock or you want to do some operations there's a {disfmarker} there should be some device to tell what to do to the uh in uh integrated circuit so that the integrated circuit can s send the signals and T_V_ can perform the actions.
Marketing: Mm okay.
Industrial Designer: So can you go to the next slide please?
Marketing: Okay.
Industrial Designer: So I I just would like to uh add some extra features to the remote controller um I think these are the very simple features and uh they don't take much uh uh much of the um um investment also,
Marketing: Mm-hmm.
Industrial Designer: it's like el the text or buttons which uh which are there on the uh remote controller they {disfmarker} those we can make uh um like fluorescent uh they'll be like light emitting if it is dark so that you can find your remote controller if it is dark.
Marketing: Mm-hmm.
Industrial Designer: And ther there should be a beep if many buttons are pressed if suppose a child is playing with the remote controller and a and she she or he is pressing the buttons all at the time then there should be a beep saying that it's {disfmarker} this this is not a a you know a a action, there can be no action taking to that so. And there should be a child lock, like uh uh you should be able to lock your remote controller so that uh um whatever buttons are pressed by a child they can't be like y you i you if you have ki kids and all then they'll be pl playing with the remote controllers so can lock the remote controller. If make it useable for more than one device it's a it's hard but I think it's possible
Project Manager: Yeah well {disfmarker} yeah well that has been e that has been eliminated, so that's that's unfortunately a moot point now. Mm-hmm.
Industrial Designer: but it uh
Marketing: Well we already eliminated that.
Industrial Designer: yeah yeah yeah
User Interface: Eliminated.
Industrial Designer: so it's it's okay, yeah, yeah. And uh different shapes that we can do like uh we can have you know a all animals shapes or you know comfortable uh whi which can fit into your hands
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: and um so that uh {disfmarker}
Marketing: Now that's good from a marketing point of view, the fun {disfmarker} the fun shape.
Industrial Designer: Yeah, yeah, yeah and colours also, different colours, and {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Yeah I {disfmarker}
User Interface: Mm-hmm colours.
Marketing: And that {disfmarker} you you say that won't add too much to the budget?
Industrial Designer: No no no, it won't uh I don't think it will be like,
Marketing: To d the shape is uh {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: you can have you know for uh if you want ther there to be more {disfmarker}
Project Manager: It just build a mould basically and uh you know.
Industrial Designer: Yeah yeah.
User Interface: Yes exactly.
Industrial Designer: It's it's just a s shape so it doesn't matter.
Project Manager: As the budget we're looking at if you build one mould I don't think that's going to make a big difference whether it's gonna be square or {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
Marketing: Do you think there's any chance of um having ser in {disfmarker} having basically the same machine with the same buttons but maybe several different shapes?
Industrial Designer: Yeah that is also possible I uh yeah I I yeah.
Project Manager: Oh yes.
Marketing: Is that gonna be a possible?
User Interface: Yes.
Project Manager: I think {disfmarker}
Marketing:'Cause that might help with the marketing.
Project Manager: I think we will have to look at the budget on that
Industrial Designer: Yeah that will be {disfmarker}
Project Manager: but I think in principle that that would be {disfmarker} that would be kind of fun, you know.
Industrial Designer: Yeah yeah.
Marketing: Because we had something sort of sexy for adults and we could have something sort of
Industrial Designer: Mm-hmm.
Project Manager: Yeah.
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Silly for children.
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: Yeah, for children, yeah exactly.
Marketing: silly for children
Project Manager: Like an animal or {disfmarker}
Marketing: or a little animal shape or in a {disfmarker} or a little elephant so they can remember where it is. {vocalsound}
User Interface: Like a doll, or {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Yeah, that's what, yeah.
Project Manager: Yeah.
Industrial Designer: Yeah, exactly. Yeah.
User Interface: Yes {vocalsound}.
Industrial Designer: And and the butto buttons also I think if you want to have more features in your remote controller then there should be more buttons. If there are more buttons then it will be more complicated. If you have less features then your remote controller won't be attractive, so I think uh we need to make some buttons which are {disfmarker} which are like um uh f in uh in intended for two or three operations, like if you press one button in one mode then it will change the channel, if you press the other button in another mode it will change the colour. So if you want to have less buttons we can have that option but I think it will complicate the matter more I think so.
Marketing: Mm. Well, I think {disfmarker} I think that that's something that we'll have to discuss um with the User Interface person
User Interface: Yes.
Industrial Designer: Yep, yeah.
Marketing: because I think there's a lot of argument to be made for one button for one feature. Because I think one of the things were complaining about in my {disfmarker} what I found out in my research is when they complained about how hard it is to learn a new one.
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: Mm-hmm.
Marketing: The changing modes was something {vocalsound} {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Yeah, it's like you know {vocalsound} yeah.
Marketing: I mean you and I, all f all four of us we work with computers all the time,
Industrial Designer: Yeah. Yeah, yeah.
User Interface: Okay.
Marketing: changing modes is nothing for us, but people who {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Yeah, a little elderly, a little arthritic hand you know,
Marketing: {vocalsound} N and {disfmarker}
Project Manager: and and it's a small button and and it {disfmarker} they don't press it exactly
Industrial Designer: Mm-hmm. Yeah.
Project Manager: you know something else happens n not their favourite channel comes up but something else
Industrial Designer: Yeah, yes.
Project Manager: and they're very frustrated you know.
User Interface: Something else.
Marketing: And that's {disfmarker} and that's the kind of thing people learn by feel, and um {vocalsound} you don't feel the mode change.
Industrial Designer: Yeah, yeah you don't {vocalsound} us yeah yeah, usually. Yeah.
Marketing: {vocalsound} So um maybe having buttons be various shapes might be a help too.
Industrial Designer: Yeah shapes also, different shapes.
Marketing: You know, like the {disfmarker} a triangle is for the volume and a square is for changing channels, so that people can uh develop a tactile sense of it.
Industrial Designer: Yeah that will {disfmarker} Mm-hmm.
User Interface: Channels.
Industrial Designer: Yeah. Yeah.
Project Manager: Mm, mm-hmm.
Industrial Designer: Yeah,
Marketing: But we'll get to that with you.
User Interface: Yes.
Industrial Designer: yeah, and also text should be very clear so that there there won't be any ambiguities and uh {disfmarker}
Marketing: That's right, yeah. Now that's a good point. Yeah.
User Interface: Yes.
Industrial Designer: So yeah.
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: And uh display clock i if you want more features then we can display a clock it I I don't think it will take any money extra money because anyway we have an integrated circuit I think we can just definitely fit that feature into the circuit so it's {disfmarker}
Marketing: Yeah, that's that's a good {disfmarker} that's a good one,
Project Manager: Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.
User Interface: Mm yeah.
Industrial Designer: Yeah, and we display a clock.
Marketing: because the clock would be really friendly,
Project Manager: Yes.
Marketing: and and when is your favourite show coming on
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
Project Manager: Yes.
Industrial Designer: Yeah, and then you can just see your remote controller yeah yeah yeah so {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Yeah you're sitting there already or maybe you have no other uh {disfmarker}
User Interface: Yes {gap}.
Marketing: {vocalsound} and {vocalsound} {disfmarker} Yeah, and a lot of time there's not a clock on the screen, and you have to go somewhere but you just wanna look at the news for a minute.
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
Marketing: Yeah that's that's good, the clock is good.
Project Manager: {vocalsound} Mm-hmm.
Industrial Designer: Yeah. Uh can you go to the next slide please?
Marketing: Okay.
Industrial Designer: Uh components uh the main components we need for uh it ha like buttons and uh underneath that there should be switch. And uh bulbs. Like uh we can have a bulb like whenever we are operating a remote controller or uh whenever the T_V_ is on suppose,
User Interface: Hmm.
Industrial Designer: then the remote controller should automatically have a b s light.
Marketing: Mm-hmm.
Industrial Designer: Then it will be like if you switch on your T_V_ through anoth another source, not from {disfmarker} through a remote remote controller and you you lost your remote controller maybe you can find with the light.
Marketing: Mm-hmm.
Industrial Designer: Maybe we can have that. Whenever the T_V_ is on, remote controller will have a light.
Marketing: Mm-hmm.
Industrial Designer: And then uh infrared bulbs. Um this is like uh when it is dark.
Marketing: Mm-hmm.
Project Manager: Yeah, mm-hmm.
Industrial Designer: And battery, there should be a battery for power supply,
Marketing: Mm-hmm.
Industrial Designer: and a chip,
Marketing: Mm-hmm.
Industrial Designer: chip which is like a brain to the remote controller which does all the operations,
Project Manager: Mm-hmm.
Industrial Designer: and wires connecting all chips, which is uh lights, everything,
Project Manager: Yeah.
User Interface: Okay.
Industrial Designer: so there should be wires. And uh uh of course there should be a case where we can keep all the things and, you know different shapes or whatever it is there should be a case to put to give a shape.
User Interface: To keep the remote? Yeah.
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
Marketing: Case.
User Interface: A case holder. A holder {disfmarker} remote holder.
Industrial Designer: Yeah, holder.
Project Manager: Holder, yeah, mm-hmm.
Industrial Designer: Um uh can you move onto the next slide. Um next sli slide please. Um I have referred the site uh the homepage of the um our website, uh from where I have uh uh I got s few points.
Project Manager: Mm-hmm.
Industrial Designer: That's it, that's it from me now.
Project Manager: Okay.
Marketing: So it {disfmarker} um we should visit this site and have a look at uh what's up there? Or {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} Um.
Project Manager: Well, you don't have to.
Industrial Designer: Uh it's not like that, I have referred the page to get new ideas or like what can be the working design to how it works and all and so and so.
Marketing: Okay. Okay. So it might be helpful if we had a look at that.
Industrial Designer: Yeah if you want. Yeah, it's okay.
Marketing: Okay, thank you. Could you go back to that slide where she had that uh s slide up Betsy?
Industrial Designer: Uh, it's actually there now, there on the screen.
Project Manager: This one?
Marketing: Yeah, okay, thank you.
Project Manager: And Francine?
User Interface: Participant two.
Project Manager: You are number two?
User Interface: Yes. No no, I'm three.
Project Manager: You're three. Would you want it full full screen?
User Interface: I can make it full? Yes yes yes.
Project Manager: Mm-hmm? Okay.
User Interface: Okay. As uh User Interface Designer I did a little research to find out what are the features which a user would like to have on their remote.
Project Manager: Mm-hmm.
User Interface: Yeah can you please go onto the next slide?
Project Manager: Mm-hmm.
User Interface: So I found out that uh but uh the main purpose of a remote is to uh f control the function of a television at a far off distance at remote distance. Now for that, uh a remote controller should have a switch on off button by which a user can sit anywhere in the room in front of the T_V_ and he can control the functionalities different functionalities of the T_V_.
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Mm-hmm.
User Interface: There should be a signal uh something like a radio wave or a infrared light or a LED which can be used to change the different functionalities in the television if the user wants to uh change the channels or increase the volume he can change it.
Marketing: Mm-hmm.
User Interface: Now there should be some timer to set for viewing a particular a particular programme or switching on and off a uh a particular programme according to the user choice.
Project Manager: On the on on the remote. Yeah, mm-hmm.
User Interface: Yes. Yes. So if if he want to view a particular programme at say nine o'clock he can set the time, and the T_V_ will automatically it will switch on at that particular time.
Project Manager: Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Right. Mm-hmm.
User Interface: So he can use that kind of uh uh properties of features and then there should be a child lock system if a particular channel is not to be viewed by a particular uh for a certain age, then the parents can lock that particular channel so that the ch children cannot view that channel.
Project Manager: Yes. By your child, mm-hmm.
Marketing: Mm-hmm.
Project Manager: Mm-hmm.
User Interface: And uh the uh the uh and the {disfmarker} one of the feature a user would like to have is the compactness of the co remote.
Project Manager: Mm-hmm.
Marketing: Mm-hmm.
User Interface: Uh t the remote should be compact and it should ha it should have as many buttons as possible for controlling different functionalities of the T_V_ television. And um uh as uh uh this is my personal preference that it should be in the shape of a T_ in alphabet for more compactability.
Project Manager: Mm-hmm.
User Interface: And uh and uh and it is one more point which I noted it down, like uh the material which which which is used for remotes should be human friendly it should not cause any skin disease or something some al allergy to either children or to um ad adult person.
Project Manager: Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.
Marketing: Mm,'kay.
Project Manager: Mm-hmm.
User Interface: And it should have an uh it can have an alarm clock a a person if some if somebody wants to get up at around eight eight P_M_ then he can set the time and it can be used as an alarm clock,
Industrial Designer: Mm.
Project Manager: Mm-hmm.
User Interface: and I don't think it will cost much to set an alarm clock inside a remote.
Industrial Designer: Yeah, sure.
Project Manager: Mm-hmm.
Industrial Designer: If there is a clock then there can be a alarm clock.
User Interface: Yes,
Marketing: And an alarm clock, yeah that should {disfmarker} that should be okay.
User Interface: and as John Reece said the buttons can be, uh can me we can use the fluorescence to light up the buttons so different uh buttons will glow differently. So in even in the dark the user can know what buttons to use to switch on a particular channel. And uh uh the design of the uh um remote should be in such a way that there should not be any sharp projections so that if a child plays with a remote, he uh he should not be harmed in any way.
Industrial Designer: Hmm.
User Interface: And findings, uh I found out uh y um on different sites that uh there are different remotes which can be used, there are remotes which use the infrared for controlling the different functionalities, there are remotes which use the radio waves to control the functions and there are uh {disfmarker} So uh there you have different uh types of remotes for different light source which are used {disfmarker} which can be used for controlling the different functionalities of a television. Next slide. And these are my few personal preferences like it can be used for a multipurpose use. Not, uh no uh like it can {disfmarker} it can be used as a T_V_ control as plus an alarm clock to set an alarm a timing and it should have a child lock, and then to save electricity uh there should not be uh much s move uh lots of circuits and all that. And if a person if if if parents wants the television to be switched off by ten o'clock then it should be switched off ten o at ten o'clock automatically, so that nobody else comes later and use it.
Industrial Designer: It's like a t okay, it's like a timer {gap} it's like a lock to the television.
Project Manager: Timer, yeah, mm-hmm, mm-hmm.
User Interface: Timer. Yeah and then you can use a timer as well. Yes. Yeah that's it.
Project Manager: Uh okay, now I have {disfmarker} On my slide show basically we already {disfmarker} we have already done the agenda, and uh on the closing uh basically there will be lunch break and all that. However uh the decision we have to take in this meeting is who is our target group. And uh what function, working design, how how does it work.
User Interface: {vocalsound} Okay.
Project Manager: So these are the two things we should come up wit with. So uh the first thing is pro maybe a little easier on uh who is our target group. Um. I guess in many ways everybody. Everybody who has a T_V_.
Industrial Designer: Mm, T_V_, yeah.
User Interface: T_V_ television we was.
Project Manager: Yeah, and I think today there are probably not many people who don't have a T_V_.
Industrial Designer: Don't T_V_, yeah.
Project Manager: There are a few but in general not. {vocalsound} Now, talking about the target group which is in a sense everybody, but I think within the target group we have subgroups. We have {disfmarker} we have earlier it was mentioned about um for example elderly people who have limited function with their fingers and hands,
User Interface: Mm-hmm.
Project Manager: so I think that's uh one group that's certainly important.
Industrial Designer: Hmm.
Project Manager: Um then we have just the nervous people who can never press a little button on anything um unless it's really very clear.
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
Project Manager: And uh I don't know how much we want to cater to children's use. I mean that's a question um whether that's important that children can really use it or not.
Industrial Designer: Mm.
Project Manager: So this {disfmarker} these are just some thoughts I have on it, and um I dunno what you feel about whether we can just say we have one target group and for this one target group we're gonna design this one thing {vocalsound}
Marketing: Mm-hmm.
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
Project Manager: or whether we're looking at what we like we we talking about different shapes, whether that different shape also includes maybe different uh buttons uh for different groups.
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Marketing: Mm-hmm.
Industrial Designer: Mm-hmm.
Marketing: Mm-hmm. Well you know there's the old motto, children under six never shop alone.
Project Manager: Mm-hmm.
Marketing: So if you've designed something that's very attractive to children um the mummy please mummy please um you know we want it now we wanna go to the store and see it um that has uh a lot of marketing pull.
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: {vocalsound} That has a lot of {disfmarker} that has a lot of appeal but I think uh I'm I'm talking about the functionality now on it whether we're looking at different groups.
Industrial Designer: Mm.
Project Manager: I think the children issue can be addressed with the shape and with colours.
Marketing: Mm-hmm.
Project Manager: You know, like you make it nice and pink, fluorescent, banana colour or whatever {vocalsound} you know
User Interface: Different colours.
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
Marketing: That's right.
User Interface: Yes.
Marketing: You can make a banana shaped one. {vocalsound}
Project Manager: yeah, for example you know.
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: Yeah. Mm.
Project Manager: But the question is really, who is our target group.
Marketing: Mm-hmm.
Project Manager: {vocalsound} Do we look at one target group? {vocalsound} And with the twenty five Euros you know can we can we afford to have uh I'm asking the technical people here whether um to look at sort of subgroups with maybe different buttons for each group how much would that throw us out of the cost we are supposed to respect?
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Marketing: Respect. Mm.
User Interface: Okay. No uh generally we can we can design a remote which is mainly for people with uh f age from ten to um forty
Project Manager: Right.
User Interface: and and then we can add on uh specific functional buttons for children as well as the elderly people or the people wit with who have nervous problems, yes.
Project Manager: With with {disfmarker} Mm-hmm.
Industrial Designer: We can design different remotes for different people, like for aged people there will be big buttons and you know.
Project Manager: Well that's that's {disfmarker}
User Interface: But in a family {disfmarker} in a family there will be a aged person, children and a middle aged but they cannot buy three different remotes.
Industrial Designer: {gap} yeah. Children and everybody, yeah.
User Interface: They would like to buy just one and um just one which can be used all the three uh {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Yeah of course that we can do, but specifically if y if like elderly people want big buttons then you can't really make a bi big remote controller so maybe specifically you can design a big con remote controller for elderly and for children, like in a different you know.
Marketing: What about the electronics? That's not really gonna change much, is it?
Project Manager: Yeah.
User Interface: Cost effective.
Industrial Designer: No, it it doesn't cost, yeah.
Project Manager: No {vocalsound}
Marketing: That {vocalsound} that w that won't change much, will it uh?
Industrial Designer: Yeah. Doesn't doesn't doesn't matter.
Project Manager: {vocalsound} The the quest the question to be addressed here is only who is the target group and how will it function,
Marketing: I d I wouldn't think so.
Project Manager: and I think the how will it function is probably the question of the buttons you know, within the target group or subgroups.
Marketing: Mm-hmm. Yeah.
Project Manager: The question is only whether our budget will allow to have more than one design in a sense. I mean the basic design I understand will be the same,
Marketing: Yeah.
Project Manager: but the question is how much will that set us back if let's say {vocalsound} uh forty percent we make large buttons and the rest we make regular buttons for example.
User Interface: Okay.
Industrial Designer: Yeah. {vocalsound}
Marketing: Yeah.
Project Manager: So that remains to s to be seen but {vocalsound} uh the target group as a whole is is basically everybody with a T_V_.
Marketing: That's right,
User Interface: Yes.
Marketing: and can we {disfmarker} can we is it even feasible to make one one remote control with something for everyone, or would we have to use the same electronics and make three different shapes?
Project Manager: Yeah, well that's that's the question.
Marketing: Um the same electronics and basically all that's gonna be different is the plastic case.
Industrial Designer: Hmm hmm.
Marketing: And in that case we could probabl moulded plastic isn't all that expensive is it?
Industrial Designer: Uh no. Mm, I I I don't think no. It's not.
Marketing: Um you as an industrial person?
Project Manager: Well maybe there's {disfmarker} there's an idea you know t the new for example new portable phones?
Marketing: Mm-hmm.
Project Manager: They have like removable plastic cases, so you can have a striped one or you can have a fluorescent blue one, or whatever,
Marketing: Yeah. Mm-hmm.
Project Manager: and maybe something like that,
User Interface: Okay.
Project Manager: that in each package you know you have {disfmarker} you you have {disfmarker} you have for example uh {vocalsound} you have let's say a fluorescent blue on it but then you have uh another colour or stripe whatever that already comes in a package.
Marketing: Well there's a real idea yeah. Mm-hmm.
Industrial Designer: Hmm.
Project Manager: And then if people really want more colours they can buy it separately.
Marketing: Yeah.
Project Manager: You know,
Industrial Designer: Yeah, like for mobile phones we have uh different you know covers, like designs and all so that w we can have that.
Marketing: Right.
User Interface: Um {disfmarker}
Project Manager: yes.
Marketing: Mm-hmm.
Project Manager: That's right,
User Interface: Yes.
Project Manager: and {disfmarker} but like if if then everybody is is is tired of the fluorescent blue and of the striped or whatever they have as another one in the package,
Marketing: Uh yeah.
Project Manager: then they can go to the store and for a few uh Francs or Euros whatever they can buy
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
Marketing: An alternate package.
Project Manager: an alternate package with another two colours in it you know for example you know.
Marketing: Yeah. Okay.
User Interface: But uh yeah I I have a doubt like will it be cost wise effective if we {disfmarker} if we design a remote having all the uh different features for different people or designing three different um remotes for three different categories of people.
Project Manager: Well I think {disfmarker} I think the idea here is to uh to to d design one remote
Industrial Designer: Yeah, but uh {disfmarker}
Marketing: Well I think we can only aff {gap}, yeah.
User Interface: Okay.
Project Manager: and what the only change is gonna be um
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
Project Manager: the funct d t yeah uh {vocalsound}
Marketing: Cosmetic.
User Interface: Of th okay.
Project Manager: the functional {vocalsound} functional cosmetics if you want to put it that way,
User Interface: Okay.
Project Manager: um having maybe larger buttons or buttons that light up or buttons that are slightly differently shaped for people uh either for children um {disfmarker}
User Interface: Mm-hmm.
Project Manager: Five minutes that was I guess tha that's the old message.
Marketing: Warning, finish meeting now. {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Finish meeting now. Um um.
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Marketing: Well we may have to come back to one or two of these points at our next meeting but um {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Yeah, maybe, yeah, yeah.
Project Manager: But I think {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: If we do some more research, maybe we {gap}.
Project Manager: I I think to sum it up the target group is basically everybody. If money permits we can address some features for some subgroups within that.
User Interface: Okay,
Marketing: Mm-hmm.
User Interface: mm-hmm.
Industrial Designer: Hmm yeah,
Project Manager: Do we agree, do we?
Industrial Designer: I think maybe seventy percent is a unique uh uh remote controller and thirty percent is yeah it's sort of like {disfmarker} yeah.
Marketing: Okay but we have to l
Project Manager: Do we agree on on that in principle, like money will tell whether we will be able to do that or not.
Industrial Designer: Yeah, yeah, of course, yeah.
User Interface: Yes.
Marketing: Okay, fair enough.
Project Manager: {vocalsound} Okay? So now I understand it's lunch break.
Industrial Designer: Mm-hmm.
Project Manager: And um. So that's what we will do.
Marketing: Okay.
User Interface: Okay.
Project Manager: So hank you very much.
Industrial Designer: Thank you.
Project Manager: And we'll see you after lunch.","It would be an attractive impulse purchase which would be out in the market by September as a Christmas present of twenty five Euros. It would be for everybody who has a TV, mainly aged ten to forty. In the subgroups of the target group, there are elderly people who have limited functions with their fingers and hands and nervous people who cannot press a little button unless it is very clear. To make the remote sellable, it should be intuitive and easy to use in order to shorten the learning curve. It could be sold with a slogan.",qmsum
"What are the main components and working design of the remote?
Project Manager: Okay, is everybody ready?
Industrial Designer: Yeah?
Marketing: Yeah I'd to just put on my microphone here and I'll be right with you.
Project Manager: Mm-hmm.
Marketing: Okay?
Project Manager: Um {vocalsound} I take it you all have received instructions as to what you were supposed to do
Industrial Designer: Mm?
User Interface: Yes.
Project Manager: and um I think the Marketing Manager probably should go first, addressing the needs and desires.
Marketing: {vocalsound} Okay you want me to start right now?
Project Manager: Yeah, mm-hmm.
Marketing: Okay.
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
Marketing: Well, could you um put my slides up'cause I think it might be helpful if uh we looked at the slides at the same time.
Project Manager: Okay. You're participant four.
Marketing: I'm participant four I believe. Yes uh-huh.
Project Manager: Okay, and now I can uh full screen.
Marketing:'Kay.
Industrial Designer: Open.
Project Manager: Uh, okay, okay.
Marketing: There we go. Okay well I think we have introduced ourselves,
Industrial Designer: And then full screen.
Marketing: so the functional requirements are {disfmarker} is {vocalsound} is part of my goal but why don't we pass right to the second slide. Cause that's where m my discussion starts. Right well um since I'm in charge of trying to figure out what we should put on this thing since I have to try to sell it.
Industrial Designer: Mm-hmm.
Marketing: Um {vocalsound} I thought that the method I should follow would be gather suggestions from everybody, and th the reason I just put that there like that is that uh in the init in the initial stage I think I should just be open to lots of suggestions. You know you can say anything you want no matter how silly it sounds you know it should run your car, it should heat up your motor if should um turn on your C_D_ {vocalsound} whatever you want it to do {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer:'Kay.
Marketing: um and then as we go on what we'll have to do is accept and eliminate these suggestions according to um design and budget feasibility. So I'll be coming to you um frequently as the Industrial Expert to tell me how hard it's gonna be to add a feature or how expensive it's gonna be or if your time, if it takes five years to develop this it's just something we can't do.
Industrial Designer: Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Hmm hmm. Mm.
Marketing: So in the beginning just have a big puddle of things that we {disfmarker} anybody can th throw anything in
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
Marketing: and then just weed things out that can't be done for one reason or another, and then the things that seem the most attractive that to uh to a customer we'll try to then prioritise those.
Industrial Designer: Mm-hmm. Yeah.
Marketing: So that was um what I meant there, and as I said on the slide there consulting the Industrial Engineer about that and the other thing is timing is really gonna be as important as money, because if we're gonna sell this thing, I think the best time to sell it is as a Christmas present. Twenty five Euros makes a nice little present, and we want it to be an impulse purchase,
Industrial Designer: Mm.
Marketing: we want somebody to see it and think it's, gee I just gotta have that. And take out their wallet and buy it. So it's gotta be really attractive and it {disfmarker} but it's gotta go to market by September,'cause anything that you don't already have out there in September showing it around, isn't gonna sell for Christmas.
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
Marketing: Um {vocalsound} and then I'll be coming to you as the User Interface person to try to tell me from your point of view what are the most friendly features that we could put on it and try to prior help me with that prioritising of uh of the features and of the the look and the colour
User Interface: Okay.
Marketing: and I'll be coming back to you to help weed out those suggestions from that point of view.
User Interface: Okay.
Marketing: So I'll be coming to you for how much is it gonna cost us and how long is it gonna take you,
Industrial Designer: Mm mm-hmm.
Marketing: and I'll be coming to you to tell me what's gonna make somebody take out their wallet you know,
User Interface: What features.
Marketing: what what's what's gonna really be what they call a sizzle,
User Interface: S sellable. Yes {vocalsound}.
Marketing:'cause we gotta sell this sizzle {vocalsound}.
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Marketing: A lot of times the thing that works the best from an engineering point of view isn't the thing that somebody's really just gonna take out their wallet and buy for Christmas for for their child or for their husband or whatever.
User Interface: Yes.
Marketing: Okay can we go to the next slide please? Alright I I already did a little bit of research after our first meeting where we threw out some ideas and it looks to me that within the budget that we're looking at the uh the whole house idea really isn't gonna be possible. So I'd like your suggestions to come back to the other slide where I was saying we we could suggest anything.
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
Marketing: I'd like the suggestions to be really specific, so that we'll have a list of things we can cross off, not something like you know whole house control what'll be {vocalsound} {disfmarker} And then I found on the internet from from my research that some extended electronic entertainment control should be possible. At the budget that we're looking at and at the price point we're looking at, we should be able to make it work the T_V_, the V_C_R_, the stereo set um maybe something else cute like a coffee pot or one other appliance or maybe a lamp.
Project Manager: {vocalsound} Uh okay, can can I at this point interject um something?
Marketing: I have to wind up? Yeah, sure.
Project Manager: Um we have received instruction from higher up that certain things should not be uh considered. Um the one thing for example {disfmarker} something to eliminate maybe that's the teletext,
Marketing: Okay.
Project Manager: because that's sort of outdated with the internet,
Industrial Designer: Mm-hmm.
Marketing: Okay.
Project Manager: and according to to higher management the {disfmarker} it should only control the T_V_,
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: mostly because they feel that it's too comp complex a task to um to to include other things,
Industrial Designer: Complicated, yeah, of course.
Project Manager: and they are concerned with the time to market.
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
Marketing: Of course, yeah.
Project Manager: Okay.
User Interface: Okay.
Project Manager: Um and the {disfmarker}
Marketing: Okay, so that's something {disfmarker}
Project Manager: and the third thing that they wanna make sure um that their {disfmarker} that the corporate image is being maintained, and that the corporate colour and design are being used on the product, so that it's easy that that that they can be easily identified as a product of of of the company, and that there's no mistake that it could be somebody else who is bringing this out.
Industrial Designer: Mm-hmm.
Project Manager: So I just wanted to interject this here so we're not getting too much off track here with uh with the things we wanna look at. These were instructions from higher up so we have to eliminate uh these things, so it's only gonna be T_V_,
Marketing: Okay so {disfmarker}
Project Manager: but the one thing maybe that could be um eliminated is the teletext uh idea.
Marketing: Okay.
Project Manager: Mm'kay.
User Interface: Okay.
Marketing: Alright, thanks for that. Um alright now {vocalsound} other things that I found out on {disfmarker} in my research is that the complaints that people have about the remote controls that are out there now.'Cause a lot of them take too much time to learn how to use, and that was thirty four percent but even more important the thing that we did address in our last meeting that frequently it's lost somewhere in the room. Um so those are two things that we definitely do wanna address, uh we wanna s make it as simple as possible, we wanna make it um obvious and intuitive to use, and then the things about finding it we talked about the {disfmarker} a light emitting thing as well as uh maybe a beep, and I think that those are things after my research that we definitely wanna try to incorporate.'Kay can we go to the next slide please? Okay, so, my personal preferences in this um project are really have to concentrate on the sizzle. That is the selling point, the thing that's gonna make it an impulse purchase. Uh because once there's no be-back, well in sales they always say you know, be-backs don't come back.
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Marketing: If somebody says, oh I'll come back and get it next week you're dead. They're never gonna come back and buy it. You've gotta make it attractive enough so they buy it now now now w now is a big word in in my book for selling this thing. And, in order to make it really sellable we've gotta shorten the learning curve, make sure it's really intuitive and easy to use. We have to have as few buttons as possible, because more buttons is more confusion, so that's why I'm saying, simplicity is good. Finding it's important, obviously you can't use it if you can't find it. So we've gotta concentrate on the features that help you find it, and I've already said this several times but I put it down in writing here, it should be an attractive impulse purchase at twenty five Euros. So it has to have enough value that when somebody looks at it they say, uh twenty five Euros I'm not gonna take that. Has to be so great that they're gonna say, uh twenty five Euros isn't much. Um and then maybe a motto, like we put fashion in electronics might be something we can use in our marketing campaign.
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
Marketing: Okay that's uh about it for me right now.
Project Manager: {vocalsound} Okay. And uh who would be next, uh, I guess that would be you. Mm-hmm.
Industrial Designer: Yeah'kay.
Project Manager: You want me to get your slide show up?
Industrial Designer: Yeah yeah sure.
Project Manager: Mm-hmm.
Industrial Designer: Thank you.
Project Manager: And you are number three?
Industrial Designer: Number two,
Project Manager: Number two.
Industrial Designer: yeah. Yeah exactly.
Project Manager: Okay. Okay.
Industrial Designer: Uh can you make it uh full screen please?
Project Manager: Mm-hmm. Yep.
Industrial Designer: No, it's like a well you you have to press here. The cup cup shape here?
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Yeah yeah, uh-huh.
Industrial Designer: The thir third.
Project Manager: There, mm-hmm.
Industrial Designer: Yeah exactly. Uh so today I'm going to talk about the working design of the remote controller. Um can you go to the next sli slide please?
Marketing: Okay.
Project Manager: Mm-hmm.
Industrial Designer: The metal is like uh in a remote controller you have a chip integrated circuit which is like a brain of the remote controller. It takes the power from a battery say a battery it it can be a elec an electric supply like you have to uh like uh switch connec connect connect your remote controller to uh power supply from the you know electricity or something like that. It should be a battery because uh uh remote controller should be like you you you should take it t to wherever you want and then um uh th
Marketing: Mm-hmm.
Industrial Designer: this integrated circuitry takes energy from the power source and whatever like if you press a button it's like a input for the remote controller and it takes the input and it it transforms into a infro infrared bits and it sends it into the device, like a T_V_ or a air conditioner, something like that so. Uh a remote controller is specifically designed to a single device. If you want to design it for multiple devices then you should make all the devices compatible with the frequency like uh th the remote controller it sends some bits some uh waves like with a particular frequency the device should know what the frequency is. It should re re recognise the uh waves which are coming from the remote controller and it should take the action like if you press a button channel or something like that then uh the remote uh remote controller will send a send a se {vocalsound} send a signal,
Marketing: {vocalsound} Signal.
Industrial Designer: and the T_V_ it should translate that into like change the channel or something like that, change the volume control
User Interface: Receive.
Marketing: Mm-hmm.
Project Manager: Mm-hmm.
Industrial Designer: and uh so uh I think it's hard to design a remote controller for multiple uh devices.
User Interface: Multi-purpose.
Project Manager: Yo and it's {disfmarker}
Marketing: Yeah well that's already been eliminated by management, so we're off the hook {vocalsound}.
Project Manager: yeah {disfmarker} but it's so {vocalsound}.
Industrial Designer: Uh yeah. {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Yep.
Industrial Designer: Um. So uh user interface controls the chip and accordingly the messages like there should be a user user in interface like you know switch pad or something like that buttons should be there. So uh you can control whatever you want, you want to change the channel you want to control the volume you you want to uh mute uh mute the uh T_V_ or you want to have a child lock or you want to do some operations there's a {disfmarker} there should be some device to tell what to do to the uh in uh integrated circuit so that the integrated circuit can s send the signals and T_V_ can perform the actions.
Marketing: Mm okay.
Industrial Designer: So can you go to the next slide please?
Marketing: Okay.
Industrial Designer: So I I just would like to uh add some extra features to the remote controller um I think these are the very simple features and uh they don't take much uh uh much of the um um investment also,
Marketing: Mm-hmm.
Industrial Designer: it's like el the text or buttons which uh which are there on the uh remote controller they {disfmarker} those we can make uh um like fluorescent uh they'll be like light emitting if it is dark so that you can find your remote controller if it is dark.
Marketing: Mm-hmm.
Industrial Designer: And ther there should be a beep if many buttons are pressed if suppose a child is playing with the remote controller and a and she she or he is pressing the buttons all at the time then there should be a beep saying that it's {disfmarker} this this is not a a you know a a action, there can be no action taking to that so. And there should be a child lock, like uh uh you should be able to lock your remote controller so that uh um whatever buttons are pressed by a child they can't be like y you i you if you have ki kids and all then they'll be pl playing with the remote controllers so can lock the remote controller. If make it useable for more than one device it's a it's hard but I think it's possible
Project Manager: Yeah well {disfmarker} yeah well that has been e that has been eliminated, so that's that's unfortunately a moot point now. Mm-hmm.
Industrial Designer: but it uh
Marketing: Well we already eliminated that.
Industrial Designer: yeah yeah yeah
User Interface: Eliminated.
Industrial Designer: so it's it's okay, yeah, yeah. And uh different shapes that we can do like uh we can have you know a all animals shapes or you know comfortable uh whi which can fit into your hands
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: and um so that uh {disfmarker}
Marketing: Now that's good from a marketing point of view, the fun {disfmarker} the fun shape.
Industrial Designer: Yeah, yeah, yeah and colours also, different colours, and {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Yeah I {disfmarker}
User Interface: Mm-hmm colours.
Marketing: And that {disfmarker} you you say that won't add too much to the budget?
Industrial Designer: No no no, it won't uh I don't think it will be like,
Marketing: To d the shape is uh {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: you can have you know for uh if you want ther there to be more {disfmarker}
Project Manager: It just build a mould basically and uh you know.
Industrial Designer: Yeah yeah.
User Interface: Yes exactly.
Industrial Designer: It's it's just a s shape so it doesn't matter.
Project Manager: As the budget we're looking at if you build one mould I don't think that's going to make a big difference whether it's gonna be square or {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
Marketing: Do you think there's any chance of um having ser in {disfmarker} having basically the same machine with the same buttons but maybe several different shapes?
Industrial Designer: Yeah that is also possible I uh yeah I I yeah.
Project Manager: Oh yes.
Marketing: Is that gonna be a possible?
User Interface: Yes.
Project Manager: I think {disfmarker}
Marketing:'Cause that might help with the marketing.
Project Manager: I think we will have to look at the budget on that
Industrial Designer: Yeah that will be {disfmarker}
Project Manager: but I think in principle that that would be {disfmarker} that would be kind of fun, you know.
Industrial Designer: Yeah yeah.
Marketing: Because we had something sort of sexy for adults and we could have something sort of
Industrial Designer: Mm-hmm.
Project Manager: Yeah.
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Silly for children.
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: Yeah, for children, yeah exactly.
Marketing: silly for children
Project Manager: Like an animal or {disfmarker}
Marketing: or a little animal shape or in a {disfmarker} or a little elephant so they can remember where it is. {vocalsound}
User Interface: Like a doll, or {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Yeah, that's what, yeah.
Project Manager: Yeah.
Industrial Designer: Yeah, exactly. Yeah.
User Interface: Yes {vocalsound}.
Industrial Designer: And and the butto buttons also I think if you want to have more features in your remote controller then there should be more buttons. If there are more buttons then it will be more complicated. If you have less features then your remote controller won't be attractive, so I think uh we need to make some buttons which are {disfmarker} which are like um uh f in uh in intended for two or three operations, like if you press one button in one mode then it will change the channel, if you press the other button in another mode it will change the colour. So if you want to have less buttons we can have that option but I think it will complicate the matter more I think so.
Marketing: Mm. Well, I think {disfmarker} I think that that's something that we'll have to discuss um with the User Interface person
User Interface: Yes.
Industrial Designer: Yep, yeah.
Marketing: because I think there's a lot of argument to be made for one button for one feature. Because I think one of the things were complaining about in my {disfmarker} what I found out in my research is when they complained about how hard it is to learn a new one.
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: Mm-hmm.
Marketing: The changing modes was something {vocalsound} {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Yeah, it's like you know {vocalsound} yeah.
Marketing: I mean you and I, all f all four of us we work with computers all the time,
Industrial Designer: Yeah. Yeah, yeah.
User Interface: Okay.
Marketing: changing modes is nothing for us, but people who {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Yeah, a little elderly, a little arthritic hand you know,
Marketing: {vocalsound} N and {disfmarker}
Project Manager: and and it's a small button and and it {disfmarker} they don't press it exactly
Industrial Designer: Mm-hmm. Yeah.
Project Manager: you know something else happens n not their favourite channel comes up but something else
Industrial Designer: Yeah, yes.
Project Manager: and they're very frustrated you know.
User Interface: Something else.
Marketing: And that's {disfmarker} and that's the kind of thing people learn by feel, and um {vocalsound} you don't feel the mode change.
Industrial Designer: Yeah, yeah you don't {vocalsound} us yeah yeah, usually. Yeah.
Marketing: {vocalsound} So um maybe having buttons be various shapes might be a help too.
Industrial Designer: Yeah shapes also, different shapes.
Marketing: You know, like the {disfmarker} a triangle is for the volume and a square is for changing channels, so that people can uh develop a tactile sense of it.
Industrial Designer: Yeah that will {disfmarker} Mm-hmm.
User Interface: Channels.
Industrial Designer: Yeah. Yeah.
Project Manager: Mm, mm-hmm.
Industrial Designer: Yeah,
Marketing: But we'll get to that with you.
User Interface: Yes.
Industrial Designer: yeah, and also text should be very clear so that there there won't be any ambiguities and uh {disfmarker}
Marketing: That's right, yeah. Now that's a good point. Yeah.
User Interface: Yes.
Industrial Designer: So yeah.
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: And uh display clock i if you want more features then we can display a clock it I I don't think it will take any money extra money because anyway we have an integrated circuit I think we can just definitely fit that feature into the circuit so it's {disfmarker}
Marketing: Yeah, that's that's a good {disfmarker} that's a good one,
Project Manager: Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.
User Interface: Mm yeah.
Industrial Designer: Yeah, and we display a clock.
Marketing: because the clock would be really friendly,
Project Manager: Yes.
Marketing: and and when is your favourite show coming on
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
Project Manager: Yes.
Industrial Designer: Yeah, and then you can just see your remote controller yeah yeah yeah so {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Yeah you're sitting there already or maybe you have no other uh {disfmarker}
User Interface: Yes {gap}.
Marketing: {vocalsound} and {vocalsound} {disfmarker} Yeah, and a lot of time there's not a clock on the screen, and you have to go somewhere but you just wanna look at the news for a minute.
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
Marketing: Yeah that's that's good, the clock is good.
Project Manager: {vocalsound} Mm-hmm.
Industrial Designer: Yeah. Uh can you go to the next slide please?
Marketing: Okay.
Industrial Designer: Uh components uh the main components we need for uh it ha like buttons and uh underneath that there should be switch. And uh bulbs. Like uh we can have a bulb like whenever we are operating a remote controller or uh whenever the T_V_ is on suppose,
User Interface: Hmm.
Industrial Designer: then the remote controller should automatically have a b s light.
Marketing: Mm-hmm.
Industrial Designer: Then it will be like if you switch on your T_V_ through anoth another source, not from {disfmarker} through a remote remote controller and you you lost your remote controller maybe you can find with the light.
Marketing: Mm-hmm.
Industrial Designer: Maybe we can have that. Whenever the T_V_ is on, remote controller will have a light.
Marketing: Mm-hmm.
Industrial Designer: And then uh infrared bulbs. Um this is like uh when it is dark.
Marketing: Mm-hmm.
Project Manager: Yeah, mm-hmm.
Industrial Designer: And battery, there should be a battery for power supply,
Marketing: Mm-hmm.
Industrial Designer: and a chip,
Marketing: Mm-hmm.
Industrial Designer: chip which is like a brain to the remote controller which does all the operations,
Project Manager: Mm-hmm.
Industrial Designer: and wires connecting all chips, which is uh lights, everything,
Project Manager: Yeah.
User Interface: Okay.
Industrial Designer: so there should be wires. And uh uh of course there should be a case where we can keep all the things and, you know different shapes or whatever it is there should be a case to put to give a shape.
User Interface: To keep the remote? Yeah.
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
Marketing: Case.
User Interface: A case holder. A holder {disfmarker} remote holder.
Industrial Designer: Yeah, holder.
Project Manager: Holder, yeah, mm-hmm.
Industrial Designer: Um uh can you move onto the next slide. Um next sli slide please. Um I have referred the site uh the homepage of the um our website, uh from where I have uh uh I got s few points.
Project Manager: Mm-hmm.
Industrial Designer: That's it, that's it from me now.
Project Manager: Okay.
Marketing: So it {disfmarker} um we should visit this site and have a look at uh what's up there? Or {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} Um.
Project Manager: Well, you don't have to.
Industrial Designer: Uh it's not like that, I have referred the page to get new ideas or like what can be the working design to how it works and all and so and so.
Marketing: Okay. Okay. So it might be helpful if we had a look at that.
Industrial Designer: Yeah if you want. Yeah, it's okay.
Marketing: Okay, thank you. Could you go back to that slide where she had that uh s slide up Betsy?
Industrial Designer: Uh, it's actually there now, there on the screen.
Project Manager: This one?
Marketing: Yeah, okay, thank you.
Project Manager: And Francine?
User Interface: Participant two.
Project Manager: You are number two?
User Interface: Yes. No no, I'm three.
Project Manager: You're three. Would you want it full full screen?
User Interface: I can make it full? Yes yes yes.
Project Manager: Mm-hmm? Okay.
User Interface: Okay. As uh User Interface Designer I did a little research to find out what are the features which a user would like to have on their remote.
Project Manager: Mm-hmm.
User Interface: Yeah can you please go onto the next slide?
Project Manager: Mm-hmm.
User Interface: So I found out that uh but uh the main purpose of a remote is to uh f control the function of a television at a far off distance at remote distance. Now for that, uh a remote controller should have a switch on off button by which a user can sit anywhere in the room in front of the T_V_ and he can control the functionalities different functionalities of the T_V_.
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Mm-hmm.
User Interface: There should be a signal uh something like a radio wave or a infrared light or a LED which can be used to change the different functionalities in the television if the user wants to uh change the channels or increase the volume he can change it.
Marketing: Mm-hmm.
User Interface: Now there should be some timer to set for viewing a particular a particular programme or switching on and off a uh a particular programme according to the user choice.
Project Manager: On the on on the remote. Yeah, mm-hmm.
User Interface: Yes. Yes. So if if he want to view a particular programme at say nine o'clock he can set the time, and the T_V_ will automatically it will switch on at that particular time.
Project Manager: Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Right. Mm-hmm.
User Interface: So he can use that kind of uh uh properties of features and then there should be a child lock system if a particular channel is not to be viewed by a particular uh for a certain age, then the parents can lock that particular channel so that the ch children cannot view that channel.
Project Manager: Yes. By your child, mm-hmm.
Marketing: Mm-hmm.
Project Manager: Mm-hmm.
User Interface: And uh the uh the uh and the {disfmarker} one of the feature a user would like to have is the compactness of the co remote.
Project Manager: Mm-hmm.
Marketing: Mm-hmm.
User Interface: Uh t the remote should be compact and it should ha it should have as many buttons as possible for controlling different functionalities of the T_V_ television. And um uh as uh uh this is my personal preference that it should be in the shape of a T_ in alphabet for more compactability.
Project Manager: Mm-hmm.
User Interface: And uh and uh and it is one more point which I noted it down, like uh the material which which which is used for remotes should be human friendly it should not cause any skin disease or something some al allergy to either children or to um ad adult person.
Project Manager: Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.
Marketing: Mm,'kay.
Project Manager: Mm-hmm.
User Interface: And it should have an uh it can have an alarm clock a a person if some if somebody wants to get up at around eight eight P_M_ then he can set the time and it can be used as an alarm clock,
Industrial Designer: Mm.
Project Manager: Mm-hmm.
User Interface: and I don't think it will cost much to set an alarm clock inside a remote.
Industrial Designer: Yeah, sure.
Project Manager: Mm-hmm.
Industrial Designer: If there is a clock then there can be a alarm clock.
User Interface: Yes,
Marketing: And an alarm clock, yeah that should {disfmarker} that should be okay.
User Interface: and as John Reece said the buttons can be, uh can me we can use the fluorescence to light up the buttons so different uh buttons will glow differently. So in even in the dark the user can know what buttons to use to switch on a particular channel. And uh uh the design of the uh um remote should be in such a way that there should not be any sharp projections so that if a child plays with a remote, he uh he should not be harmed in any way.
Industrial Designer: Hmm.
User Interface: And findings, uh I found out uh y um on different sites that uh there are different remotes which can be used, there are remotes which use the infrared for controlling the different functionalities, there are remotes which use the radio waves to control the functions and there are uh {disfmarker} So uh there you have different uh types of remotes for different light source which are used {disfmarker} which can be used for controlling the different functionalities of a television. Next slide. And these are my few personal preferences like it can be used for a multipurpose use. Not, uh no uh like it can {disfmarker} it can be used as a T_V_ control as plus an alarm clock to set an alarm a timing and it should have a child lock, and then to save electricity uh there should not be uh much s move uh lots of circuits and all that. And if a person if if if parents wants the television to be switched off by ten o'clock then it should be switched off ten o at ten o'clock automatically, so that nobody else comes later and use it.
Industrial Designer: It's like a t okay, it's like a timer {gap} it's like a lock to the television.
Project Manager: Timer, yeah, mm-hmm, mm-hmm.
User Interface: Timer. Yeah and then you can use a timer as well. Yes. Yeah that's it.
Project Manager: Uh okay, now I have {disfmarker} On my slide show basically we already {disfmarker} we have already done the agenda, and uh on the closing uh basically there will be lunch break and all that. However uh the decision we have to take in this meeting is who is our target group. And uh what function, working design, how how does it work.
User Interface: {vocalsound} Okay.
Project Manager: So these are the two things we should come up wit with. So uh the first thing is pro maybe a little easier on uh who is our target group. Um. I guess in many ways everybody. Everybody who has a T_V_.
Industrial Designer: Mm, T_V_, yeah.
User Interface: T_V_ television we was.
Project Manager: Yeah, and I think today there are probably not many people who don't have a T_V_.
Industrial Designer: Don't T_V_, yeah.
Project Manager: There are a few but in general not. {vocalsound} Now, talking about the target group which is in a sense everybody, but I think within the target group we have subgroups. We have {disfmarker} we have earlier it was mentioned about um for example elderly people who have limited function with their fingers and hands,
User Interface: Mm-hmm.
Project Manager: so I think that's uh one group that's certainly important.
Industrial Designer: Hmm.
Project Manager: Um then we have just the nervous people who can never press a little button on anything um unless it's really very clear.
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
Project Manager: And uh I don't know how much we want to cater to children's use. I mean that's a question um whether that's important that children can really use it or not.
Industrial Designer: Mm.
Project Manager: So this {disfmarker} these are just some thoughts I have on it, and um I dunno what you feel about whether we can just say we have one target group and for this one target group we're gonna design this one thing {vocalsound}
Marketing: Mm-hmm.
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
Project Manager: or whether we're looking at what we like we we talking about different shapes, whether that different shape also includes maybe different uh buttons uh for different groups.
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Marketing: Mm-hmm.
Industrial Designer: Mm-hmm.
Marketing: Mm-hmm. Well you know there's the old motto, children under six never shop alone.
Project Manager: Mm-hmm.
Marketing: So if you've designed something that's very attractive to children um the mummy please mummy please um you know we want it now we wanna go to the store and see it um that has uh a lot of marketing pull.
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: {vocalsound} That has a lot of {disfmarker} that has a lot of appeal but I think uh I'm I'm talking about the functionality now on it whether we're looking at different groups.
Industrial Designer: Mm.
Project Manager: I think the children issue can be addressed with the shape and with colours.
Marketing: Mm-hmm.
Project Manager: You know, like you make it nice and pink, fluorescent, banana colour or whatever {vocalsound} you know
User Interface: Different colours.
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
Marketing: That's right.
User Interface: Yes.
Marketing: You can make a banana shaped one. {vocalsound}
Project Manager: yeah, for example you know.
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: Yeah. Mm.
Project Manager: But the question is really, who is our target group.
Marketing: Mm-hmm.
Project Manager: {vocalsound} Do we look at one target group? {vocalsound} And with the twenty five Euros you know can we can we afford to have uh I'm asking the technical people here whether um to look at sort of subgroups with maybe different buttons for each group how much would that throw us out of the cost we are supposed to respect?
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Marketing: Respect. Mm.
User Interface: Okay. No uh generally we can we can design a remote which is mainly for people with uh f age from ten to um forty
Project Manager: Right.
User Interface: and and then we can add on uh specific functional buttons for children as well as the elderly people or the people wit with who have nervous problems, yes.
Project Manager: With with {disfmarker} Mm-hmm.
Industrial Designer: We can design different remotes for different people, like for aged people there will be big buttons and you know.
Project Manager: Well that's that's {disfmarker}
User Interface: But in a family {disfmarker} in a family there will be a aged person, children and a middle aged but they cannot buy three different remotes.
Industrial Designer: {gap} yeah. Children and everybody, yeah.
User Interface: They would like to buy just one and um just one which can be used all the three uh {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Yeah of course that we can do, but specifically if y if like elderly people want big buttons then you can't really make a bi big remote controller so maybe specifically you can design a big con remote controller for elderly and for children, like in a different you know.
Marketing: What about the electronics? That's not really gonna change much, is it?
Project Manager: Yeah.
User Interface: Cost effective.
Industrial Designer: No, it it doesn't cost, yeah.
Project Manager: No {vocalsound}
Marketing: That {vocalsound} that w that won't change much, will it uh?
Industrial Designer: Yeah. Doesn't doesn't doesn't matter.
Project Manager: {vocalsound} The the quest the question to be addressed here is only who is the target group and how will it function,
Marketing: I d I wouldn't think so.
Project Manager: and I think the how will it function is probably the question of the buttons you know, within the target group or subgroups.
Marketing: Mm-hmm. Yeah.
Project Manager: The question is only whether our budget will allow to have more than one design in a sense. I mean the basic design I understand will be the same,
Marketing: Yeah.
Project Manager: but the question is how much will that set us back if let's say {vocalsound} uh forty percent we make large buttons and the rest we make regular buttons for example.
User Interface: Okay.
Industrial Designer: Yeah. {vocalsound}
Marketing: Yeah.
Project Manager: So that remains to s to be seen but {vocalsound} uh the target group as a whole is is basically everybody with a T_V_.
Marketing: That's right,
User Interface: Yes.
Marketing: and can we {disfmarker} can we is it even feasible to make one one remote control with something for everyone, or would we have to use the same electronics and make three different shapes?
Project Manager: Yeah, well that's that's the question.
Marketing: Um the same electronics and basically all that's gonna be different is the plastic case.
Industrial Designer: Hmm hmm.
Marketing: And in that case we could probabl moulded plastic isn't all that expensive is it?
Industrial Designer: Uh no. Mm, I I I don't think no. It's not.
Marketing: Um you as an industrial person?
Project Manager: Well maybe there's {disfmarker} there's an idea you know t the new for example new portable phones?
Marketing: Mm-hmm.
Project Manager: They have like removable plastic cases, so you can have a striped one or you can have a fluorescent blue one, or whatever,
Marketing: Yeah. Mm-hmm.
Project Manager: and maybe something like that,
User Interface: Okay.
Project Manager: that in each package you know you have {disfmarker} you you have {disfmarker} you have for example uh {vocalsound} you have let's say a fluorescent blue on it but then you have uh another colour or stripe whatever that already comes in a package.
Marketing: Well there's a real idea yeah. Mm-hmm.
Industrial Designer: Hmm.
Project Manager: And then if people really want more colours they can buy it separately.
Marketing: Yeah.
Project Manager: You know,
Industrial Designer: Yeah, like for mobile phones we have uh different you know covers, like designs and all so that w we can have that.
Marketing: Right.
User Interface: Um {disfmarker}
Project Manager: yes.
Marketing: Mm-hmm.
Project Manager: That's right,
User Interface: Yes.
Project Manager: and {disfmarker} but like if if then everybody is is is tired of the fluorescent blue and of the striped or whatever they have as another one in the package,
Marketing: Uh yeah.
Project Manager: then they can go to the store and for a few uh Francs or Euros whatever they can buy
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
Marketing: An alternate package.
Project Manager: an alternate package with another two colours in it you know for example you know.
Marketing: Yeah. Okay.
User Interface: But uh yeah I I have a doubt like will it be cost wise effective if we {disfmarker} if we design a remote having all the uh different features for different people or designing three different um remotes for three different categories of people.
Project Manager: Well I think {disfmarker} I think the idea here is to uh to to d design one remote
Industrial Designer: Yeah, but uh {disfmarker}
Marketing: Well I think we can only aff {gap}, yeah.
User Interface: Okay.
Project Manager: and what the only change is gonna be um
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
Project Manager: the funct d t yeah uh {vocalsound}
Marketing: Cosmetic.
User Interface: Of th okay.
Project Manager: the functional {vocalsound} functional cosmetics if you want to put it that way,
User Interface: Okay.
Project Manager: um having maybe larger buttons or buttons that light up or buttons that are slightly differently shaped for people uh either for children um {disfmarker}
User Interface: Mm-hmm.
Project Manager: Five minutes that was I guess tha that's the old message.
Marketing: Warning, finish meeting now. {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Finish meeting now. Um um.
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Marketing: Well we may have to come back to one or two of these points at our next meeting but um {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Yeah, maybe, yeah, yeah.
Project Manager: But I think {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: If we do some more research, maybe we {gap}.
Project Manager: I I think to sum it up the target group is basically everybody. If money permits we can address some features for some subgroups within that.
User Interface: Okay,
Marketing: Mm-hmm.
User Interface: mm-hmm.
Industrial Designer: Hmm yeah,
Project Manager: Do we agree, do we?
Industrial Designer: I think maybe seventy percent is a unique uh uh remote controller and thirty percent is yeah it's sort of like {disfmarker} yeah.
Marketing: Okay but we have to l
Project Manager: Do we agree on on that in principle, like money will tell whether we will be able to do that or not.
Industrial Designer: Yeah, yeah, of course, yeah.
User Interface: Yes.
Marketing: Okay, fair enough.
Project Manager: {vocalsound} Okay? So now I understand it's lunch break.
Industrial Designer: Mm-hmm.
Project Manager: And um. So that's what we will do.
Marketing: Okay.
User Interface: Okay.
Project Manager: So hank you very much.
Industrial Designer: Thank you.
Project Manager: And we'll see you after lunch.","The remote control would have a chip in the integrated circuit, taking power from the battery and transforming input from buttons through wires into infrared signals to electronic devices. There will be buttons and underneath them are switches and bulbs. To hold everything in, there should be a case and a remote holder. The material used for the remote should be human friendly so that it will not cause any skin disease or allergy to either children or adults. The frequency of each electronic device is different so it would be very difficult to design a control for multiple devices.",qmsum
"Summarize the whole meeting.
Project Manager: So {disfmarker} Hello. {vocalsound}
Marketing: Good afternoon. Sorry I'm a little late.
Project Manager: No problem.
Marketing: Got stuck in the traffic.
Project Manager: Okay. {vocalsound}
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: That's possible on uh this time of day. Starts at three o'clock. Uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound}
Marketing: Yeah.
Project Manager: Uh, let me see. Our fourth and last meeting. There he is. Yes. Okay this our last meeting. In this meeting we will discuss our final design. And we will do some evaluation about the, not only the product, but also the project. And then we're going to close the project today as well. So after this you will be uh free to go and uh spend all your money. {vocalsound}
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Marketing: {vocalsound} {vocalsound}
Project Manager: And this uh design, detailed design meeting uh we will discuss uh the look-and-feel of the design, the usability interface design, and we will do the product evaluation. Um, in order to do that we have this agenda. We'll have the prototype presentation first. Then we will set up some evaluation cri um criteria. {vocalsound} Then we will look at the finance. Uh we will have to see if everything we wanna do is also possible within our budget. Because everything costs money, and the more functions you wanna have the more money it will cost. So we have to see if it fits within the twelve and a half Euro per remote. But we will see that later. Then we will do the project uh evaluation, and the closing after that.
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: We've got forty minutes. So we will be finished at half past three. But first um we will do the {disfmarker} this is prototype presentation. So, if some yeah if somebody wants step forward.
Industrial Designer: Okay. Well this is what me and Richard came up with. The default spot for the on-off button. The mute button just below that. Then there's the volume and channel selectors. Simple plus-minus button. Uh we thought of a help button. If you hold it and you press another button, uh the help goes to the L_C_D_ screen. Then there's the zero to {disfmarker} one to zero buttons. A button for teletext. A button for the subtitles. And the company logo. So it's rather simple prototype. And uh we'll have to see from testing uh how the users take it.
Project Manager: Okay.
Marketing: Um, {vocalsound} is this the moment where we ask or can ask questions about the functionality?
User Interface: So {disfmarker} Yeah. Yeah.
Industrial Designer: Sure uh just pop in at any time.
Marketing: Um, when you're in teletext there usually are buttons where you just you just press it and you g go to the next teletext page.
User Interface: Uh, that's just uh the normal uh as th as the normal uh remote controls uh {disfmarker} So um {disfmarker} You put it uh {disfmarker} you um came in uh page uh one hundred. Now you can use the normal uh one to zero buttons.
Marketing: Mm-hmm.
User Interface: And you {disfmarker} But you can also uh use the um button th for uh changing the the channel. S so uh the shifting uh button. Uh for uh yeah shif shifting up in uh on t on t uh teletext, and shifting uh down. So {disfmarker}
Marketing: Okay. Okay. Um {disfmarker} Yeah.
Project Manager: Okay. Uh but um I thought in a few meetings earlier we uh uh tried to keep it uh simple. Uh just a few buttons and large buttons.
User Interface: Oh yeah?
Project Manager: But uh I think these are altogether quite a quite a few buttons. So I'm wondering if we if we neely {disfmarker} really need all of those buttons.
User Interface: {vocalsound} {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: I think if you look at most controls, they've got more buttons than this.
Project Manager: That's right.
User Interface: Yeah.
Industrial Designer: And well the on-off button, it's it's a necessity.
Project Manager: Yeah.
User Interface: Yeah.
Industrial Designer: You can't drop that one. The volume and channel buttons, you need you obviously need those those.
Project Manager: Yeah.
Industrial Designer: The mute button could be replaced uh by pressing the volume-down button twice. So we could cancel that one. I think the help button really is necessary
User Interface: Yeah yeah.
Industrial Designer: because there's no other way to know when someone wants to know what a button does.
Project Manager: Mm.
User Interface: Uh, or you can build in uh when you press uh one button uh uh {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Long time. Yeah.
User Interface: Yeah.
Project Manager: If you put {disfmarker}
User Interface: But m Yeah. We disc discuss that already. But uh we think uh old people uh don't know that uh option. So uh they just put in uh put {vocalsound} press uh the button and uh {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Yeah. Okay.
Industrial Designer: Well, {vocalsound} you can't leave out the number buttons I guess.
Project Manager: Yeah.
User Interface: And uh {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Uh teletext and subtitles are yeah necessary.
Industrial Designer: And {disfmarker} {vocalsound}
User Interface: Oh.
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
Marketing: Yeah.
Project Manager: Okay.
Industrial Designer: So it's rather basic already.
Marketing: Yeah. Think so. That's what I pointed out earlier. If you just make a control for just the T_V_ there's just not much to gain here.
Project Manager: Yep.
User Interface: Yeah.
Project Manager: Okay. So we had somebody about th interfa Something about the design of the buttons there?
Industrial Designer: Yeah, they're {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Just n normal plain buttons.
User Interface: Yeah. Yeah,
Industrial Designer: It's rather hard to draw on the white-board.
User Interface: it {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: But they're supposed to be equal sized, round, with a with a little logo on it for the for the volume, the the triangle and stuff.
Project Manager: Yeah.'Kay.
User Interface: Yeah yeah. Just to recognise it, so uh {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Just for recognition.
User Interface: Uh yeah and now we don't need uh LEDs or um {disfmarker} Y uh
Project Manager: No.
User Interface: s some uh remote controls uh do it also,
Project Manager: No.
User Interface: but um uh because we use the little display we don't uh have to use it. Uh so {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Yeah. Okay.
Industrial Designer: So and for the materials we've just chosen for rubber buttons. With a a different colour than the case.
User Interface: Nay.
Project Manager: Yep.
Industrial Designer: So they jump out.
Project Manager: Okay.
Industrial Designer: And uh that's about it.
Project Manager: That's nice. Then because we only have thirty minutes left, I will move on to the finance part, which is pretty exciting, to see if it's all possible what we wanna do. And I can tell you that we're going to have a pretty hard time producing this for twelve and a half Euros.
Marketing: {vocalsound}
User Interface: Mm.
Project Manager: If we see {disfmarker} I don't know if I've filled in correctly, so just correct me if you see uh something wrong. I counted two batteries. But maybe we can also use one. I don't know if it's possible.
Marketing: Since it rechargeable.
Project Manager: It's rechargeable. That's right.
User Interface: Yeah we can u just uh {gap} {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Okay. That's two Euros off. {vocalsound}
User Interface:'Kay. {vocalsound}
Project Manager: We need the advanced chip. So there's not much to uh {vocalsound} to save there.
Industrial Designer: Yep.
Project Manager: {vocalsound} Here we have the single curves. Uh we can see that the difference between uncurved and the single curved is one Euro. Um,
User Interface: Mm.
Project Manager: I don't know, but I think the single curved is good for design, and also for the display to have a prominent place on the remote control.
User Interface: Yeah.
Project Manager: I think we have to keep that.
Industrial Designer: Yes.
User Interface: Yeah.
Project Manager: Then we have the case material supplements. It's plastic. It's the cheapest one we need. So that's uh not much to save either. But then the biggest costs are the buttons. So maybe we really should try to discard some buttons to uh keep our costs low.
User Interface: Okay.
Project Manager: Because you have to {disfmarker} we will have to get the twelve and a half Euros at the end. Um,
User Interface: Yeah.
Project Manager: so if we {disfmarker} Let's fir first count the buttons we have now.
User Interface: Uh {disfmarker} Sixteen, I believe so.
Project Manager: Because I {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Sixteen. Nah, that will be even more then. Eighteen Euros. So,
User Interface: Uh seventeen. Uh with the help button.
Project Manager: seventeen.
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Marketing: Um {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Okay, including the help?
Industrial Designer: Yep.
Marketing: Damn.
Project Manager: Yeah. Uh seventeen.
User Interface: Yeah.
Project Manager: I think we can uh discard the help and the mute button uh by pressing down volume long, or pressing down a a number long.
Marketing: {vocalsound}
User Interface: {gap}.
Industrial Designer: Yep.
Project Manager: That saves us uh one Euro already.'Cause then we have got fifteen I think?
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
Marketing: Wouldn't {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Fifteen buttons.
Marketing: Yeah. No. That wouldn't be an option.
Project Manager: And this is {disfmarker}
Marketing: Uh, d I assume you'd count the volume and channel thingies for two buttons each, right?
Project Manager: No those are one, I think.
User Interface: Yeah. Where did uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound}
Marketing: Well, think actually there're two buttons,
User Interface: Uh, it's just one button.
Marketing: aren't they?
User Interface: But, um {disfmarker} Yeah. There were uh two uh for one big button. But they are uh more expensive than the small ones. Uh, yeah. So {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Yeah but th it's not stated in this files.
User Interface: It's just a {gap}.
Project Manager: So maybe we can we can even make one button with the volume and the channel in one, by pressing
Marketing: Well I was thinking, maybe you could just integrate three of those numbers to one button.
Project Manager: That's possibility as well.
Marketing: That would cut the cost.
Project Manager: So {disfmarker} And it's good for the design as well. So you can make {disfmarker} Uh let's see. If you make this {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Looks a bit like uh a cross. {vocalsound} Plus. Min.
User Interface: But I don't don't know if if it's cheaper.
Project Manager: Uh s yeah channel.
User Interface: So uh,
Project Manager: Yeah w
User Interface: we've still got four buttons, but just um {disfmarker} So {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Yeah th I think they count uh the materials.
User Interface: You got uh not not a butt button itself, but uh on the um {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Yeah on the chip there. Yeah.
User Interface: Yeah. On the chip you've got still uh four uh four buttons.
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
Marketing: Mm-hmm.
Project Manager: That's right. That's right.
User Interface: So {disfmarker}
Project Manager: But I think because we have the advanced chip
Marketing: Yeah.
Project Manager: {vocalsound} we can just count this as one button.
User Interface: Yeah, but {disfmarker}
Marketing: {vocalsound} But, I think this really is four buttons anyhow.
Project Manager: But {disfmarker} No but I think {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Yes.
Project Manager: {vocalsound} Yeah. Maybe it is, but then it seems to me that it's impossible to get the twelve and a half Euros. Also the L_C_ display, I think it's, I think it's too expensive for the display we use.
Marketing: Yes.
Industrial Designer: Uh that's that's a big cost.
Project Manager: I think they uh try t
Industrial Designer: If we leave out the display we can also save money on the chip.
Project Manager: That's right, but what's the big advantage of our remote then? {vocalsound}
Marketing: Only the docking station, I guess.
Project Manager: Yeah.
Industrial Designer: Which isn't the {disfmarker} the docking station isn't even in this c s schematic.
Project Manager: No.
Industrial Designer: So it's not even taken into the price.
Project Manager: That's extra. {vocalsound} That's extra. That's right.
Marketing: Maybe we should to a different supplier.
Project Manager: {vocalsound} That's an option.
Marketing: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Yeah.
Project Manager: Poland. Something. {vocalsound} Polish supplier. Don't you think we can, if we can count this as v as one button, and integrate th uh these buttons in three, then we save a lot of money as well.
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} We we could save money on it. But would it make the remote more usable for elderly people?
User Interface: {gap}.
Marketing: Yeah, that's what I'm wondering. {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: My mother can't even send send an S_M_S_ message.
Project Manager: Yeah. That's a point.
Industrial Designer: So {disfmarker}
User Interface: {vocalsound} Are we gonna buy a um a remote control uh when you can uh use it?
Marketing: Um {disfmarker}
User Interface: So um {disfmarker} Yeah. We m uh we must um stay below the um below um twelve uh fifty or {disfmarker} Can't uh go um {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Yep.
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
Project Manager: No.
Marketing: Well, since the market research indicated that older people spend their money easier, more easy, maybe it's feasible to just put the price of the remote up a little. Especially since we have those nice features.
User Interface: Nay.
Project Manager: Yeah but uh we have to stick to the twelve and a half Euros. We don't have any more budget to develop it.
User Interface: Is it impossible to {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: The margin will get too small. Yeah.
Project Manager: Yeah. So {disfmarker}
User Interface: But it is possible to make one uh for uh twelve fifty.
Project Manager: It is. If you leave out the L_C_ display. And if you use less buttons. Say {disfmarker} Or you can take the single chip.
User Interface: I don't think so.
Marketing: It would be a be a pretty rigid one.
User Interface: S Yeah. {vocalsound}
Marketing: {vocalsound}
User Interface: But, you can't use uh {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Ten.
Project Manager: There it is. {vocalsound}
User Interface: Yeah.
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: But then w Good looking.
User Interface: Uh, wi with n Oh, with uh attractive uh o options.
Project Manager: Yeah.
User Interface: So uh, you can stay uh below uh twelve fifty. So {disfmarker}
Project Manager: I think it's uh difficult as well,
Marketing: Or b
Project Manager: but {disfmarker}
Marketing: Basically becoming a choice between like either a good remote and a higher production cost, or just any other remote control.
Industrial Designer: No remote. {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Or we can leave out the ten buttons and take one scroll wheel for the programme numbers. Then w
User Interface: Scroll-wheel's one.
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} That's {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Because then we save ten buttons.
User Interface: No, it {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Then we have five and one.
User Interface: Yeah.
Project Manager: And and see. If we have this one and we've got the advanced {disfmarker} W uh, we're getting close. {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: We're getting closer.
User Interface: Yeah. {vocalsound}
Marketing: But how does scroll-wheel work here?
Project Manager: Then you will {disfmarker} Or maybe you can um scroll. If you scroll you will see the numbers on the L_C_D_ display. Until you've got the right number, then you push it.
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
Marketing: That would bring up the price of the scroll-wheel also. Integrated scroll-wheel push-button.
Project Manager: Alright. It's gotta scroll and push.
User Interface: Mm.
Project Manager: Okay but then you you can push uh some other button as well.
Marketing: But {disfmarker} Yeah.
Industrial Designer: You could just not scroll for a half a second.
Project Manager: Yeah. That's right. So if you scroll to a number and then you wait a half second, then it g turns to that channel.
Industrial Designer: So you won't need a button.
Marketing: I think that would be like the end of our usability.
Project Manager: {vocalsound} But it would definitely crop cost, a lot.
User Interface: D yeah. {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Marketing: {vocalsound} Yeah, but {disfmarker} {vocalsound}
Project Manager: And we need the battery. {vocalsound} And the regular chip is not possible? It has to be advanced?
Industrial Designer: If you want to use an L_C_D_ screen you you need an advanced chip, yes.
Project Manager: It has to be advanced. Yeah. Okay.
User Interface: Hmm.
Project Manager: And we can save a Euro by a flat design. That's an option we can {disfmarker}
User Interface: Ja ja.
Industrial Designer: Yep.
Project Manager: Then we're almost there.
Industrial Designer: Yeah if you v could just leave out one more button.
Project Manager: Yeah. So if we {disfmarker}
User Interface: Yeah, or we have to uh skip the subtitle uh button.
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
Project Manager: Yeah but I think that's {disfmarker} That is a big advantage,
User Interface: So {disfmarker} Yeah {disfmarker}
Project Manager: if we're {disfmarker}
User Interface: Yeah it's a big advantage.
Project Manager: But {disfmarker}
User Interface: But um, it's {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Can we use {disfmarker} can't we integrate the teletext and the subtitles in one button?
User Interface: Uh, yeah.
Industrial Designer: I think so. Yeah.
Project Manager: If you push it three times?
Marketing: Well, think it's pretty much the teletext subtitles are
User Interface: Yeah.
Marketing: right now you just push the teletext button, go to page eight eight eight,
Project Manager: Yeah.
User Interface: Yeah.
Marketing: and teletext disappears. But the subtitles stay there.
User Interface: {gap} {disfmarker} But if you push the teletext button twice {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} What if you have to scroll to page eighty eight? Eight hundred eighty eight. {vocalsound}
Marketing: I think that's the case on most {disfmarker}
User Interface: It's uh {disfmarker} One m uh one b uh, a few buttons.
Project Manager: Ah that's not really that {disfmarker}
Marketing: Well, that could be just uh like the scroll to eight, click, scroll to eight, click, scroll to eight, click.
Industrial Designer: Yeah. Okay.
Marketing: But then again that would be d j just pretty much not an option for older people,
Industrial Designer: No.
Marketing: who don't even know what a scroll-wheel is.
User Interface: Yeah.
Project Manager: No.
Marketing: Holding a remote with {vocalsound} which they expect to have like ten buttons for the numbers one to zero.
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Marketing: With only five buttons on it. And a scroll-wheel.
Project Manager: I think if you make a good advertisement uh on television and in the in the guide, you can explain to the people how to use the scroll wheel. If you just make it real simple. Because it saves it saves a lot of money. And we can keep our L_C_D_ screen, which can provide extra information. How to use the scroll wheel. How to use the other bu buttons as subtitles.
Marketing: True. True.
User Interface: Hmm.
Project Manager: And it's good for the innovative design as well. If you would erase these. Mm eraser? And we put uh {disfmarker} Looks a bit odd maybe. {vocalsound}
Marketing: That's a pretty big scroll wheel.
Project Manager: That is {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Something like that.
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Then, yeah. We've got the scroll-wheel. One, two, three, four, five buttons, if we erase this one. And these are two buttons then.
Industrial Designer: We could make two buttons out of that. And just um {disfmarker} If you press the volume button you can control the volume with the scroll-wheel.
Project Manager: Yeah.
Industrial Designer: So that would save two buttons. If you do the same for the channel.
Project Manager: Yeah. That's really a good good idea, I think. And it will make the use of the scroll wheel uh more obvious indeed.
Industrial Designer: More obvious.
Project Manager: So we make one for the volume, one for the channel. Plus scroll. That's right.
Industrial Designer: So if we {disfmarker}
Project Manager: So we've got one, two, three. Yeah, we can leave the teletext in if we want. That's m that's better.
User Interface: Yeah.
Industrial Designer: Yeah. So {disfmarker}
Marketing: So this is five buttons.
Industrial Designer: If we leave out all those buttons, perhaps you can go with the flat flat case. And make it smaller overall.
Project Manager: Y yeah.
Industrial Designer: So if you put the the volume and channel buttons on the same height as the on-off button, the screen right behi under that, than the scroll button
Project Manager: Mm yeah. Uh yeah, and then you can {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: you get a a much smaller remote.
Project Manager: That's right.
User Interface: Uh yeah.
Industrial Designer: And it sh
Project Manager: So we can decrease this one to four buttons.
Industrial Designer: Yeah?
Marketing: Right now we have five.
User Interface: But uh, you can make a f quite a big uh remote remote control for uh just the same price as a small one.
Project Manager: Yeah. That's no problem.
User Interface: Just uh you only have to pay for the double curved or single curved. It uh it's a bit uh {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Yeah. Yeah. It's uh it's more the moulds in which they are being made, I think. Single curved is really easy to just fill in.
Marketing: Mm.
Project Manager: And cases come right out of the machine.
User Interface: {gap}.
Project Manager: And single curved you have to have a different uh different machine, than a flat one. I think this is a really easy one. Um, what does everybody think about a flat or a single curved design? Freek, what do you think?
Marketing: Well, I still think we should go for the single curve design.
User Interface: {gap}.
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
Marketing: But then again, {gap} all these changes are not really okay with me.
Industrial Designer: Richard's argument was very good. Yeah.
Project Manager: Yeah.
User Interface: Yeah.
Project Manager: Yep.
Marketing: But since we just have to.
Project Manager: {vocalsound} We have to cut costs. {vocalsound}
User Interface: Yeah.
Project Manager: Yeah. Yeah I'm ag
Marketing: I'd rather just go to the board and get us to spend {vocalsound} eighteen dollars a a remote.
Project Manager: Ask for more money. Yeah. Yeah. I am agreeing with the usability. Yeah.
Marketing: Or do some market research and see what the options are.
Project Manager: Yeah. But th um I think we can then keep the single curved one. Just to express our L_C_D_ screen a bit more.
Industrial Designer: Yep.
Marketing: Yeah.
Project Manager: So people will use it more, and especially for the help functions,
User Interface: Yeah.
Project Manager: it will be good if we have scroll bar, scroll button. It will be necessary to have good help function, as well. So this is scroll. I think it was better to have this price list a bit earlier. {vocalsound} Before we went on to the to the whole design.
Marketing: Yes. Definitely. {vocalsound}
User Interface: The th
Project Manager: But {disfmarker} I'm glad we could make a bit.
Marketing: Yeah.
Project Manager: It's pretty different, if you saw the last one than {vocalsound} this one.
Marketing: {vocalsound} It's pretty different.
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Marketing: But this is not really like for the group we were making our remote.
User Interface: No.
Marketing: This will really require a lot of marketing to get this to sell.
Project Manager: Yeah. It will. Yeah.
User Interface: {vocalsound} But um {disfmarker}
Marketing:'Cause if older people like familiar forms and familiar stuff. This is not familiar for them.
Project Manager: No, but I think {disfmarker}
Marketing: So we're gonna have to do a lotta convincing them.
Project Manager: I think the most {disfmarker}
User Interface: But they know the scroll-buttons from uh old radios. Uh they cal also uh buttons like that for uh changing uh channels.
Project Manager: That's right.
Marketing: Yeah.
Project Manager: We can let l
User Interface: So maybe it's uh {disfmarker}
Project Manager: We can stick it out, a bit. Like a old old buttons. {vocalsound}
User Interface: Yeah. Yeah.
Project Manager: Maybe that's recognisable for them as well. Yeah. That's a good one.
User Interface: Yeah.
Project Manager: So, I'm afraid we have to move on. And it's uh it's b uh less frightening, I think. If they see this design they think oh, there are only five buttons, and uh {disfmarker} But we will see.
User Interface: Yeah.
Marketing: That's true. Might uh {disfmarker} might be confusing too.
Project Manager: Yeah. That's definitely right.
User Interface: Mm-hmm.
Marketing: They'd be like, what? Only five buttons?
Project Manager: Yeah.
User Interface: But very special, so uh {disfmarker}
Project Manager: I would buy it. {vocalsound}
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Marketing: {vocalsound} Yeah. But you're not sixty. {vocalsound}
Project Manager: That's right. I would buy it if I was six. {vocalsound} No I don't know. What it costs under twelve and a half Euros? No? Uh, yes they are.
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
User Interface: No. {vocalsound}
Project Manager: No. But we can go on with the project evaluation.
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Marketing: Mm-hmm.
Project Manager: Let's see. I can sit down I think. We still have fifteen minutes left, so we're nice on schedule.
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
Project Manager: Um, the project process.
Marketing: So um, I like set up all these criteria. And evaluation of the thingy. {vocalsound}
Project Manager: {vocalsound} Evaluation criteria. That's right. That was the the point I forgot. I should {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: There we are. Evaluation criteria. {vocalsound}
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Marketing: Thank you. {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Go ahead.
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: We've got five minutes I think for those criteria.
Marketing: Five more minutes?
Project Manager: No we've got fifteen minutes but {disfmarker}
Marketing: Okay.
Project Manager: Uh yes. What?
Marketing:'Kay so I did some literature study study, and analysis of the requirements we set up earlier.
Project Manager: Uh yeah.
Marketing: Translated it into criteria, which would be these. Um, is the remote fancy? The shape, look and feel. Innovative? What new functions are there? Uh, easy to use? Uh, learnability is a very important factor here. Uh, is it functional? Are there not too many functions uh among the functions? And are the those functions that are there, are they useful? And the cost. The target group. Is the remote really for the group we're making it for? And recognability. If our company is {disfmarker} If it is easily recognisable that our company made it? And {disfmarker} So we're supposed to evaluate it right now.
Project Manager: Okay.
Marketing: Let's see. Oh I have to say this was a little hard, because the minutes of our last meeting were not here.
Project Manager: Yeah, that's because my pen failed to upload his data.
User Interface: Mm. Yeah? {vocalsound}
Marketing: Okay.
Project Manager: {vocalsound} I tried to
Marketing: Interesting.
Project Manager: but it's uh it's giving errors by downloading the software.
Marketing: So {disfmarker} {vocalsound}
User Interface: Mm.'Kay.
Marketing: Is the design fancy, on a scale of one to seven?
Project Manager: I think it's fancy.
Industrial Designer: Six.
Project Manager: Yeah. Six.
User Interface: Uh six. Yeah.
Marketing: We all go for six? Good. Um, is the design innovative?
Project Manager: Very. {vocalsound}
User Interface: Mm. Sh
Marketing: I think so, with our L_C_D_ screen, docking station, scroll-buttons.
Project Manager: Subtitles, buttons. Yeah. Seven.
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
Marketing: Seven?
Project Manager: Yeah.
User Interface: Yeah.
Project Manager: So we've got twenty cents for our docking station, huh? {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Marketing: {vocalsound} Should be do-able.
Project Manager: Yeah. That's right.
Marketing: Is the design easy to use?
User Interface: Mm. Not really.
Project Manager: That's a bit dodgy.
Marketing: Well {disfmarker} Would be for us. But {disfmarker}
User Interface: For old people I I {disfmarker}
Project Manager: I would say four. Four or five between. Between four or five.
User Interface: W
Industrial Designer: Four or five. Yes.
User Interface: Yeah. Four.
Marketing: I'd go for four, too.
Project Manager: Yeah.
User Interface: Yeah.
Project Manager: Is it functional?
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Marketing: Is the design functional? Um, do we have all functions that we want to include?
Project Manager: Yes.
User Interface: N Yeah.
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Marketing: I think we do. Do we have too many functions?
Project Manager: No.
User Interface: No.
Industrial Designer: No.
Marketing: I don't think so. It's pretty slim.
Project Manager: Think it's uh seven.
Marketing: Seven. Oh, and do we um take care of the biggest frustrations of the remote control? Like it getting lost and {disfmarker} R_S_I_ influences?
User Interface: Mm m
Industrial Designer: Mm, we haven't thought of that one.
Project Manager: It was.
Marketing: Think we do.
Project Manager: I had them worked out. Mm. They are ugly, not very functional, and getting lost.
User Interface: Yeah.
Marketing: Are the production costs within the preset limits?
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Marketing: Well they are now.
Project Manager: Yeah.
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Marketing: Does the design fit the group of focus?
User Interface: Mm, th yeah.
Industrial Designer: I think that's a three.
Marketing: {vocalsound} Yeah.
Project Manager: No I think with our new radio button, I think it's uh I think it's better.
Marketing: I think it doesn't.
User Interface: Yeah. Uh {disfmarker} We have to test it s But {disfmarker} {vocalsound}
Marketing: I don't know.
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} I still {disfmarker} I think it's too m too fancy. Too too flashy.
Marketing: I think {disfmarker}
Project Manager: I think it {disfmarker}
Marketing: I think a radio button is not exactly what older people expect to have a remote control.
User Interface: Uh, yeah, true.
Project Manager: Yeah. I would give it a four.
Marketing: I'm not sure. I think I'd go for two.
User Interface: I go for three. So {disfmarker} {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Then we have to do the three. It's the {disfmarker}
Marketing:'Kay. Is the company company recognisable?
Project Manager: Yes it is.
User Interface: Yeah yeah.
Marketing: Well, we have the logo there.
Project Manager: Yeah.
Marketing: So {disfmarker}
Project Manager: And they wanna put fashion in their products. Uh in the slogan of the company. And we have the removable front cases. So, I think it's very recognisable.
User Interface: Yeah.
Marketing: Yeah.
Project Manager: Yep.
Marketing: So that will be this. I was also supposed to calculate the score, but thought we would have another private thingy after this.
Project Manager: We've got a calculate it. Mm?
Industrial Designer: Twendag sieven an twendag.
Marketing: Is this {disfmarker} Like after this, are we done? Or {disfmarker}
Project Manager: N We've gonna {disfmarker} We're going to evaluate it.
Marketing: We're gonna go to our other room again. Well, anyhow. These are seven factors times seven is forty something. Two? No.
Project Manager: {gap} Forty nine.
Marketing: Nine? Uh, minus one. Minus three, minus four. {vocalsound} Minus four. So that would be minus eight. Forty one out of forty nine.
Project Manager: Forty one. That's {disfmarker} Around eighty percent.
Marketing: Okay.
Project Manager: What is it?
Marketing: Guess I'll just type that in on the bottom here.
Project Manager: That's eighty four percent. I think that's a pretty nice score.
User Interface: Hmm. Yeah. {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
Project Manager: {vocalsound} Okay.
Marketing: Hmm.'Kay. So that will be the evaluation.
Project Manager: Thank you. So, that brings us to the project evaluation. Yep. Thank you.
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Project process. Did we move through the right phases, you think? {vocalsound} Along the process?
Industrial Designer: Yes.
User Interface: Yeah. But it {disfmarker}
Marketing: Think we should have a should have had the finance thingy a lot earlier. In the design phase.
User Interface: Yeah.
Project Manager: That's right. So lack of information about prices.
User Interface: Yeah.
Industrial Designer: Yeah. That's true.
Marketing: Yeah. Definitely.
Project Manager: Okay. Uh {disfmarker} Okay. Satisfaction. Was there room for creativity?
Marketing: No.
Project Manager: {vocalsound} No? {vocalsound}
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Marketing: Not too much. {vocalsound} No. {vocalsound}
Project Manager: It's because of the finance sheet. Yeah.
User Interface: Yeah.
Industrial Designer: Yeah, there w there was enough room, but the finance uh {disfmarker}
Marketing: Yeah, true. But {disfmarker}
Project Manager: The room was {disfmarker} Yeah.
User Interface: Yeah.
Marketing: And I would've liked to go for the younger users also.
User Interface: {gap}.
Marketing: And just to be able to access internet and get something of your own.
User Interface: Mm.
Project Manager: Restrictions. Internet access.'Kay. Leadership. Was it clear what everybody had to do uh according to their roles and functions? Yeah?
User Interface: Yeah.
Industrial Designer: Yes.
Marketing: Yeah.
Project Manager: Teamwork? Did it work out? Working together? Also, you {disfmarker} two of you with the uh last phase?
User Interface: So {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Yes, was okay.
User Interface: Yeah.
Project Manager: Nice.
Industrial Designer: The tasks are very structured, so you can just do step by step and it's very easy.
User Interface: Mm-hmm.
Marketing: Mm-hmm.
Project Manager: {gap} tasks. Okay. Were the means sufficient for the tasks uh we had to do? Or were they too much?
User Interface: Mm.
Industrial Designer: Well, the smart-board, the d d drawing is just a pain in the ass, but {disfmarker} The digital the digital pen is very nice.
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Smart-board.
User Interface: Yeah.
Project Manager: If it wants to download its uh data. {vocalsound}
User Interface: But {disfmarker}
Marketing: Yeah. Yeah. {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: Yes. Yeah.
User Interface: Uh {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Failed download. Smart-board was irritating. {vocalsound} So you rather wanted to have a flip-over? Or something else?
User Interface: Yeah.
Industrial Designer: A flip-over or a more precise uh digit
User Interface: A flipper's uh easier, so {disfmarker} Yeah.
Project Manager: Faster as well, I think.
Marketing: Yeah.
Industrial Designer: Yes.
Project Manager: Yeah. Flip-over.
User Interface: But if you want to share uh of uh when you make um a picture like this uh on the presentation, it's easier to uh share it with uh other people. Uh so uh
Project Manager: Yeah.
User Interface: you can sh save it uh and uh put it on the internet, or uh uh in shared f uh folder or uh sh uh shared directory.
Marketing: Yeah,
User Interface: So {disfmarker} So {disfmarker}
Marketing: I tried to open the file on my laptop,
User Interface: Yeah? No?
Industrial Designer: No. Didn't work.
Marketing: but {vocalsound} not possible.
Project Manager: Uh you need a smart board uh application I think.
Marketing: Yeah.
Project Manager: But I think you can {disfmarker}
User Interface: T can uh can you export it uh like a {disfmarker} Yeah.
Project Manager: Yeah. Should be possible. Yeah you can export it as image.
Marketing: {gap} no.
Project Manager: Must {disfmarker} Yeah must be {disfmarker}
Marketing: Should've done that then.
Project Manager: So the sharing of the information was uh was okay?
User Interface: {gap}.
Marketing: Pen is here.
Project Manager: Uh, network.
User Interface: Uh {gap}.
Industrial Designer: Yes.
Project Manager: Yeah, pen is here on the table.
Marketing: {vocalsound}
User Interface: Uh, yeah. So you can {disfmarker} Uh {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Yeah. {gap} It's possible.
User Interface: It's possible.
Marketing: Mm. Yeah.
Project Manager: Okay.
User Interface: Okay.
Project Manager: That's nice. Have we found new ideas for having this kind of meetings? Or {disfmarker}
User Interface: Um, yeah maybe um uh when we n uh just uh give the numbers of of uh {disfmarker} Uh uh o one of uh out of s uh sev {gap}
Project Manager: Yeah.
User Interface: Um it's uh easier to uh to do the th things that are like that on a computer. Uh, so uh just l uh like uh at u university uh {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Yeah. So {disfmarker} Yeah. So everybody puts his own score.
User Interface: So {disfmarker}
Marketing: Mm-hmm.
Project Manager: And then {vocalsound} it mediates the score,
User Interface: Yeah.
Marketing: Yeah.
Project Manager: and you can get one {disfmarker}
User Interface: Yeah.
Project Manager: Yeah.
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
Project Manager: That's better. So that's uh {disfmarker} How do we call? Evaluation criteria. Okay. Mm, any more ideas? Or questions about the project? Or about the product?
User Interface: Mm.
Project Manager: Because I think then that we get to our last sheet. Are the costs within the budget?
User Interface: Mm yeah.
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Yeah.
Marketing: They are.
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} Considering we are not going to make a docking station.
Project Manager: Do we {disfmarker} Docking station. That's a good point.
User Interface: {gap}.
Project Manager: But maybe because of the docking station the price of the remote can also be a little bit higher?
Marketing: Yeah.
Project Manager: Uh and I think you can compensate that as well.
Industrial Designer: Perhaps.
User Interface: Mm.
Project Manager: So I think that shouldn't be the biggest problem, because it's very cheap to make as well.
Industrial Designer: Mm-hmm.
Project Manager: Do we think we gonna get the twelve and a half million?
User Interface: Yeah.
Project Manager: Or what was it? {vocalsound}
Marketing: Fifty grand.
Project Manager: Fifteen fifteen million. I think we will. {vocalsound} If we gonna export this product. It's innovative.
Marketing: Yeah.
Project Manager: Especially in America. People are pretty decadent. Sometimes.
User Interface: Yeah. Mm.
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
User Interface: Yeah.
Marketing: Yeah, still I think {disfmarker} I mean if we're n gonna make a scroll-button anyway it'd be more for the younger people than for the older people.
Project Manager: You can do more. Yeah.
User Interface: Ah.
Marketing: So maybe we should just re-focus.
Project Manager: Just put it on the market for everybody. You can you can change markets where by changing the front covers.
User Interface: Ah.
Marketing: Or specifically for younger people.
Project Manager: That's one thing you can change it with.
User Interface: Ah.
Marketing: That's true.
Project Manager: So you can also try to uh reach the younger people by uh putting fancy covers on on the market. Just as a test. See how it works. That's I think a good advantage.
Marketing: Yeah, I think then it would be way more uh popular with younger people than it is, than would be with older people. Even if it were their covers.
Project Manager: Yeah. Uh, uh then I think we can have our little celebration, right now.
User Interface: Hmm.
Marketing: But {disfmarker} {vocalsound}
User Interface: {gap} {vocalsound}
Project Manager: That's it. {vocalsound}
Marketing: {vocalsound} Party party.
Project Manager: Yeah. I think we still have to fit in one more questionnaire. I think.
User Interface: Where's the champagne?
Marketing:'Kay.
Project Manager: I don't know. I didn't get a message from the from ending of the {disfmarker}
User Interface: Uh, I believe y uh {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Oh I think I have one now.
Marketing: Oh you did.
Project Manager: Five more minutes? Oh that's nice.
User Interface: Okay.
Project Manager: Then we still have some questions. If somebody has some questions they can ask them now. Or we can put these in the project folder as well. Maybe that's {disfmarker}
Marketing: Mm-hmm.
User Interface: Yeah.
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound}
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Export as picture, I think.
User Interface: Yeah.
Marketing: Yeah.
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Hmm. This is another network, I guess. Does somebody see the project folder? {vocalsound}
Marketing: {vocalsound}
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: I don't. Hmm. My Documents.
User Interface: Uh maybe uh they will save it. So uh {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Yeah, I'll just put it in My Documents
Marketing: Yeah, it probably will.
Project Manager: and uh {disfmarker} That's okay. Okay. {vocalsound} I think I'm going to make our final presentation now.
Marketing: Oh yeah, you're supposed to make a final {disfmarker}
Project Manager: {vocalsound} And then I will be back in about ten minutes to show you the final presentation. Summary of the project.
User Interface: Okay.
Industrial Designer: Okay.
Marketing: Are we supposed to go into our own rooms again?
User Interface: Uh maybe we have to fill uh another questionnaire.
Project Manager: Yeah. Questionnaire. I think you all get a questionnaire in in your room.
User Interface: So uh {disfmarker}
Marketing: Yeah.
User Interface: Yeah. Yeah. {vocalsound}
Project Manager: And then I'll meet you in I think about ten minutes, or something.
User Interface: Okay.
Industrial Designer: Okay.
Project Manager: Hopefully my pen will download its software. Oh. Or data.
Marketing: {vocalsound} Yeah. That'd be nice.","The whole meeting was the final meeting of the project for discussion about the final design and project evaluation. Firstly, though Project Manager came late, he efficiently started the prototype presentation, during which Industrial Designer and User Interface presented the final design they worked out together. However, part of the features contained in their design, particularly too many buttons, were effectively rejected in the finance phase to reduce cost. Then, Marketing hosted the product evaluation and calculated a total score for their new remote control. After that, Project Manager guided the process evaluation and led the project to the closing phase.",qmsum
"How did Industrial Designer introduce the two prototypes of the remote control?
Marketing: Did you get my email with the slides? Ah. Tricky.
Industrial Designer: I guess I have to change the pen otherwise. Will be completely different.
Marketing: Dunno. Maybe they're supposed {disfmarker} the pen's supposed to go over the seats. Might be seat floor rather than person. Yeah, put it back.
Industrial Designer: Yeah. And do you think {vocalsound} it's {gap}.
Marketing: Yep {vocalsound}. Yeah.
Project Manager: {vocalsound} Okay.
Marketing: Jo's making faces at me. {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
Project Manager: So. Matthew is uh late again.
Marketing: Mm-hmm.
Project Manager: {vocalsound} Probably an important man. Um. So well it is important for him to be here uh.
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} Yeah.
Project Manager: He he he {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: So what can you {disfmarker} {gap}?
Project Manager: You did work together didn't you?
Industrial Designer: Yeah we will {disfmarker} yeah, so I will be able to to summarize uh our meeting,
Project Manager: Yes.
Industrial Designer: but still I think uh it would be in very important if the uh as um main designer. I think we can put on the {gap} here.
Project Manager: Yes. Yes.
Industrial Designer: Uh basically w yeah we we designed the two uh items.
Project Manager: Mm. Um yes
Industrial Designer: Um, can we have a phone,
Project Manager: but w we {disfmarker} {vocalsound} {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: can someone {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Yes, maybe we should phone him. Um well {disfmarker} Um,
Industrial Designer: it's really w well designed {vocalsound}.
Marketing: Mm. Mm, object tracking. {vocalsound}
Project Manager: when he is not here we will just we just have to continue. Um so just for record I I will take uh notes again.
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
Marketing: Okay.
Project Manager: And um well {vocalsound} first thing uh I was uh uh I got an email from uh from my superior again that we really should stay within the budget of the uh twelve Euro and fifty cents.
Industrial Designer:'Kay.
Project Manager: when you stay in it's good, when you don't stay in you have to redesign. There is no {vocalsound} uh no negotiation uh {vocalsound} possible in this matter. So we have to consider that. {vocalsound} Good.
Industrial Designer: Yep.
Project Manager: Um so maybe Anna, you can have your presentation.
Marketing: Well we can't {disfmarker} no {disfmarker} we can't do evaluation'til we have a design.
Project Manager: Okay Matthew. Nice uh you are here.
Industrial Designer: Great.
Project Manager: Great. Great. Oh ma maybe then you can start now with mm presenting your uh your designs.
Industrial Designer: Yep. So I will start by the the basic one that uh fits into uh eight Euros actually, right, seven eight Euros,
Marketing: Mm-hmm.
Industrial Designer: and uh well first for both they have um a special shape, maybe the designer can uh explain better than me, but uh it's like a surf board.
Marketing: Mm'kay.
Industrial Designer: And you you are supposed to surf to browse to surf T_V_, maybe the web, and uh it's kind of interesting shape because um unconsciously people want to s to surf {vocalsound} when they see this stuff.
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
User Interface: Or browse.
Industrial Designer: And also it's not too far from um a mobile.
Marketing: Mm-hmm.
Project Manager: Mm.
Industrial Designer: So people are used to that kind of shape,
User Interface: Mm.
Marketing: Mm-hmm.
Industrial Designer: right. Don't take care too much about the colour because w yeah we don't take {disfmarker}
User Interface: Now we are supposed to give some oper offers right now.
Industrial Designer: yeah. So here would be basically the the the infrared uh uh led
Marketing: {vocalsound} Mm-hmm.
Project Manager: Eye.
User Interface: {vocalsound} I {disfmarker} yeah.
Industrial Designer: yeah L_A_ L_A_ L_E_D_,
User Interface: L_E_D_.
Industrial Designer: the on-off button, in red.
Marketing: Mm-hmm.
Industrial Designer: Here would be the volume. On the on the left,
Marketing: Oh yeah.
Project Manager: Uh-huh.
Industrial Designer: okay, so {gap}
User Interface: Mm-hmm, hmm.
Project Manager: Yes.
Industrial Designer: easy to turn on t and off. And um so this is a very cheap version so there are {disfmarker} maybe you can carry on uh Matthew.
User Interface: Also {vocalsound} so you have uh uh browsing the channels, actually
Marketing: Mm-hmm.
User Interface: so you can go up and down the channels,
Marketing: Yeah.
User Interface: uh, if you have a video or something you can forward, back.
Industrial Designer: How can you change from V_C_R_ to uh T_V_, by the way?
User Interface: Oh {gap} no no no, this is a single {disfmarker} this this is a model with just the T_V_ one.
Industrial Designer: Okay yeah. Yeah yeah.
Project Manager: Ah, okay.
User Interface: No no just sorry, this is a standard T_V_ one, we are not talking about that. So and then we have usually there twelve keys but we know that we rel that we have only ten digits.
Marketing: Mm-hmm.
User Interface: The extra two are for uh having or giving an option for uh having more than one channel. And the other one is for the teletext or something you want to browse through from that. Actually.
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
Marketing: Okay so
Project Manager: Mm-hmm.
Marketing: it's it's t a very basic remote then, it's only {disfmarker}
User Interface: It's a very basic minimal thing
Marketing: Mm.
Project Manager: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
User Interface: which you can {disfmarker} which is which is also available in the market, actually that's what it {gap} {disfmarker} that it {disfmarker} {vocalsound} i
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
User Interface: and would cost us to build it about eight Euros.
Project Manager: Mm.
Marketing: Mm.
Industrial Designer: Seven, eight, ei eight Euros.
Project Manager: Exce except for the for the special shape, the surfing board, it has a quite a a conventional layout of buttons uh.
User Interface: Yeah. Yeah.
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
User Interface: So this one model
Marketing: Can I see?
User Interface: and uh {disfmarker} yeah. Sure.
Marketing: Thanks. Okay I like the volume control, that's good.
Industrial Designer: {gap} {vocalsound}
User Interface: {vocalsound} Th {vocalsound} this is a magic one but I know we don't want to talk about that,
Marketing: {vocalsound}
User Interface: you know like {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
User Interface: uh i i i it is a very futuristic, it's like uh it's like a brain machine interface and all this stuff we are thinking about in the future, it can come.
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
Marketing: Uh-huh.
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
Marketing: So it doesn't actually have buttons.
User Interface: {vocalsound} So that uh {vocalsound} {disfmarker} then what we look t
Marketing: Did you wanna see?
User Interface: yeah.
Project Manager: Mm-hmm. Yeah no you can carry on,
User Interface: This is a model,
Project Manager: I just look how it feels all.
User Interface: yeah.
Project Manager: Yes it really feels like like like a mobile phone.
Marketing: Mm.
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
User Interface: Yep.
Project Manager: Just I'm {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Yeah actually, yeah.
Project Manager: I really want to talk to it.
Marketing: {vocalsound} It won't talk back. {vocalsound}
Project Manager: But {gap}.
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: {vocalsound} So but but continue with your uh
User Interface: Uh so well
Project Manager: mm-hmm.
User Interface: then the this is the {vocalsound} a more a little uh smooth
Industrial Designer: {gap}
User Interface: and it gives a lot of functionality, uh in this way, so all we have uh th you see there are only six keys, but don't worry they are ma they are doing the job of twelve keys actually here.
Marketing: Right.
Project Manager: Mm.
User Interface: And so they have more space actually
Marketing: Mm-hmm.
User Interface: and uh it's easy to uh use this and uh you have um so this is a standard uh {gap} uh infrared eye, and then you have a power button, which l volume, what you have,
Project Manager: Mm-hmm.
User Interface: and then other than that you have uh channel up and down and uh f slow pause or s slow lo
Industrial Designer: Play, pause.
User Interface: yeah s pause or stop, and uh then uh you can uh you have a L_C_D_ display, here
Project Manager: Mm-hmm.
User Interface: and uh y this is a functional thing which can change like it's a toggle switch which could change the function say, y you press it {disfmarker}
Project Manager: From D_V_D_ player to television or something.
Industrial Designer: Exactly yeah. To audio and to video on demand.
User Interface: Yeah. I really can change it,
Project Manager: Yes.
User Interface: so {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Mm.
User Interface: Instead of having many switches, y {vocalsound}
Marketing: Mm-hmm.
Project Manager: Yes and and and then you get feedback via the L_C_D_ yeah.
User Interface: The L_C_D_ can display what is that on that,
Industrial Designer: Yes.
Project Manager: Mm-hmm.
User Interface: and uh well you can have a integrated microphone over here,
Industrial Designer: This is the orange button, the {vocalsound} microphone.
User Interface: or in the button th here,
Project Manager: Mm-hmm.
User Interface: so which can uh basically you want to do a speech recognition and uh that channel a lot of information can be di displayed here directly on the um on your on your display.
Industrial Designer: An yeah.
User Interface: And here is a small L_E_D_ which is like blinking one,
Project Manager: Mm-hmm.
User Interface: which tells you like uh are you running out of the battery, and which is can be useful for the locating as I was talking earlier
Project Manager: Mm-hmm {vocalsound}.
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
User Interface: okay. And uh well then we have a cover basically, basically you don't need much of the time this,
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
User Interface: {vocalsound} when you need you can use it, and this gives additional functionality that tomorrow you want you can add a tactile thing to this cover
Project Manager: Mm. Yeah
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} Crazy dis designer,
User Interface: you know.
Industrial Designer: okay. {vocalsound}
User Interface: Design enter {vocalsound}.
Project Manager: but but but but uh i in there uh when this is closed, will it also uh cover up the L_C_D_ screen?
User Interface: Yeah.
Industrial Designer: Yeah yeah yeah yeah.
User Interface: Yeah. It's basically to do that.
Project Manager: But but the L_C_D_ screen I mean is a very uh well an eye-attracting feature
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: which shouldn't be shouldn't be {disfmarker}
User Interface: Actually when you are watching the T_V_, {vocalsound} when you are watching anything or listening to them, you hardly care about what is getting displayed here,
Industrial Designer: Oh actually {disfmarker} well.
Project Manager: {vocalsound} That th that's true.
User Interface: you know, uh you want to uh {disfmarker} and this gives a protection to the L_C_D_ actually, giving a cover to that actually. Gives a protection
Project Manager: Mm.
User Interface: because when it falls down or something it it is it is is is it gives a protec
Project Manager: Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yes. Yes, more robust.
User Interface: it's more robust that way. Uh yeah.
Marketing: Mm.
Project Manager: Yes okay.
User Interface: And you have very good chances {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: It's low weight. You have to see yeah yeah the the components we put inside is very low weight.
User Interface: Yeah.
Project Manager: Mm-hmm.
User Interface: Yeah.
Industrial Designer: So the the cost is actually a bit more, it's uh {vocalsound} it's it's sixteen Francs.
User Interface: It {disfmarker} Sixteen Euros.
Project Manager: {gap} Okay.
Industrial Designer: Sixteen Euros sorry.
Marketing: So it's well outside the budget then.
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: Then it's out of budget.
Project Manager: But w
Industrial Designer: But the the main point we we talk about that with our uh manufacturer. And they say basically that the S_R_ system would be uh something like three Francs per item {disfmarker}
User Interface: Yeah.
Industrial Designer: so
User Interface: Three Euros.
Industrial Designer: three Euros sorry. And um {disfmarker}
Marketing: That's on top of the sixteen, or is it part of that?
Industrial Designer: No no no, part of that, yeah.
User Interface: Part of that {gap}.
Marketing: So that takes it down to thirteen Euros without the speech recognition.
Industrial Designer: Yeah, yeah.
Project Manager: {vocalsound} Mm'kay. Hmm. {gap}
User Interface: {vocalsound} Yeah.
Marketing: Mm-hmm.
User Interface: Well uh if you {disfmarker} we can have {disfmarker} if you have new more ideas we can add new more uh some more keys if you want to you know {vocalsound} {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Mm-hmm.
Industrial Designer: Well I think th th yeah we should {vocalsound} stick with uh a number of keys
Marketing: Mm.
Industrial Designer: because if we add too much then
User Interface: Yeah
Project Manager: Mm-hmm {gap}.
Industrial Designer: it's too {disfmarker}
User Interface: it it should not be cluttering up everything.
Marketing: What's this one on the side?
User Interface: Ah that's for the {disfmarker} it's kind of a L_E_D_ for indicating your battery
Industrial Designer: Locati. Location.
Marketing: Ah okay.
User Interface: and as well as it's like a blinking one
Marketing: Mm-hmm. Mm'kay.
User Interface: you know
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
User Interface: you can keep it aside.
Marketing: I like the shape of them, I do like the the size and the the shape.
Project Manager: Well well {disfmarker} Mm.
User Interface: Yeah.
Project Manager: Be before ta talking about the money and what's possible and what is not possible, maybe Anna you can uh give our uh give us your um {disfmarker}
Marketing: Mm-hmm. Okay. And maybe we run the evaluation on both of the products, both of these two.
Project Manager: Yes. Evalua evaluation and also the evaluation criteria, so what what is important to look at.
Marketing: Okay. {vocalsound} Basically this is what we've talked about already, um, from the marketing point of view.
Project Manager: Mm-hmm.
Marketing: We just wanna make sure that we've taken into account {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Well
Marketing: Yep.
Project Manager: just do it quickly if if we al already {gap}.
Marketing: So it's just a shortlist of criteria on um the things that we've identified as being important to selling the product.
Project Manager: Mm-hmm.
Marketing: Um we just go through these and rate them as a group and then at the end we'll make an evaluation based on that, so just average the score of those items, so {disfmarker} {vocalsound} These are the things we identified as being important. Um {gap} the three things were look and feel, innovation and ease of use, were the three important components
Project Manager: Mm-hmm.
Marketing: um appealing to the correct demographic so using those things in the right way to appeal to our demographic. And then goin following the company motto, following the fashion trends and putting that into the product as well. So well do you wanna go through and put through those on the the two products now or do we wanna discuss them further and then evaluate them?
Project Manager: Um, n no why not why not discuss uh discuss it now, {gap} {disfmarker}
Marketing: Okay. So f just go through onto the whiteboard I guess. Not sure how this is gonna come out. So the first one was really {vocalsound} very far below budget, would you want to take the price down of the end product according to that or just have the high profit on it?'Cause if we're only going to make it for eight Euros then we have a {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Mm, well my my personal view is uh w when when this one is eight Euros we must think how can we improve it.
Marketing: Mm-hmm.
Project Manager: And then {disfmarker} I mean w w w you must just see it {vocalsound} {disfmarker} we can still spend this four and a half Euro
Marketing: Mm-hmm. Yep.
Project Manager: and to r because th th th the the selling price is already prite fik uh uh quite fixed on twenty five Euros
Industrial Designer: Mm-hmm.
Marketing: Mm-hmm.
Project Manager: so we just have to offer as much as as {disfmarker} well value for the for the customer uh he can have for twenty five Euro.
Industrial Designer: Functionality.
Marketing: Okay so look and feel, innovation {disfmarker} {gap}
User Interface: And now it {gap} easy to use.
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: Easy to use.
Project Manager: Mm.
Industrial Designer: {gap} target.
Marketing: Mm-hmm. And trends. Oh, you following the idea of using the um removable covers on these? Is that part of both of them or?
Project Manager: Um well w w we can still discuss that.
Marketing: Okay.
Project Manager: So um, and together with evaluating this uh we we might come with new ideas
Marketing: Mm-hmm.
Project Manager: I mean adding things or uh removing uh of options because they are too expensive,
Marketing: Mm-hmm.
Project Manager: but um I've received uh a framework which we can do this. I mean did you have this this Excel sheet?
Marketing: Mm-hmm.
Industrial Designer: No.
User Interface: No.
Marketing: No.
Project Manager: No okay, this is these are the the the latest prices of our production uh uh production unit for several components,
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: so we can uh see whether the the price is is within the twelve Euro uh fifty cents uh.
Marketing: Mm-hmm. Okay.
Project Manager: So maybe we can start with this, uh, calling this one. {vocalsound}
Marketing: Okay. Yep. So it's the pink.
Project Manager: Th th this is the first design.
Marketing: And the other one's green. Okay, so
Project Manager: Yes.
Marketing: look and feel? Where um one is {vocalsound} I've broken the pen again. S
Project Manager: Uh there is another pen.
Marketing: yeah. Get that one. Um w {vocalsound} one's bad and seven's the best. Sorry, one's true and seven's false. One's the best.
Project Manager: Okay.
Marketing: So on a scale of one to seven?
Project Manager:'Kay. Okay. So. Look and feel. Well you already feel that uh pretty much I think {vocalsound}.
User Interface: {vocalsound} {gap}
Project Manager: In i in my opinion purely feel is is is very good, is very good in your hand,
Marketing: Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm, yeah. Mm-hmm.
Project Manager: so I I I would consider two or or may maybe even one for feel.
Marketing: Mm-hmm.
Project Manager: But that's just half, we should also consider look,
Marketing: Mm-hmm.
Project Manager: and then i it looks quite conventional.
Marketing: Mm.
Project Manager: Don't you agree?
User Interface: Mm yeah.
Marketing: On the scale u it's between functional and fancy basically we're looking at,
Project Manager: So maybe two. Hmm. Hmm. Ma ma ma ma maybe say say five
Marketing: so {disfmarker}
Project Manager: I {disfmarker} It's my opinion, but I don't know what what
User Interface: Well I will give it maybe {disfmarker} we have anyways {disfmarker} the way we have designed it's like the surf as you say {vocalsound}
Marketing: Mm-hmm.
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
User Interface: you know. It {disfmarker} though the look is fine but uh still I will give four in that case
Industrial Designer: Yeah. Four maybe.
User Interface: you know.
Marketing: Four? Okay.
Project Manager: Four, four.
User Interface: Four yeah
Project Manager: Now we th th
User Interface: that {disfmarker}
Marketing: Mm-hmm.
Project Manager: then we settle on four.
User Interface: Yeah. I will gi yeah.
Marketing: {gap}
Project Manager:'Kay. Can you maybe fix the other {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Uh. Yeah.
Marketing: Mm.
Industrial Designer: If you press like this not like this {gap} then you {disfmarker}
Marketing: No that's the {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: {gap}
User Interface: No.
Marketing: ink's dried.
User Interface: C can you get the batteries? No no the battery has fallen down,
Marketing: Battery's low, isn't it the ink?
User Interface: that's i
Marketing: The b that's the that that one?
User Interface: Yeah.
Marketing: {gap} battery there.
Industrial Designer: But {disfmarker}
User Interface: No no it's not that, it's how to close a battery.
Industrial Designer: Okay.
User Interface: Okay? Now it should be {gap}.
Marketing: Mm. No I think it's lost a battery.
Project Manager: Mm, try it, just try it.
Marketing: No it's {disfmarker} It would still write
Project Manager: Oh it will not
Marketing: but it wouldn't pick it up with the sensors.
Project Manager: ri mm, mm.
User Interface: Is there another battery there? Oh yeah.
Marketing: You got a second?
Industrial Designer: Try a {disfmarker}
Marketing: Well we won't be able to tell.
Project Manager: Yes, it it has a {disfmarker} mm.
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: Perfect.
Marketing: Is that working?
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Marketing: Did it come out? Good. Okay.
Project Manager: Good. Good.
Marketing: Because we'll be able to see it still even if it wasn't working, it's just a normal whiteboard marker
Industrial Designer: Yeah, yeah.
Marketing: but it wouldn't be picked up on the the actual whiteboard.
Industrial Designer: Yep.
Project Manager: Okay. So then then {disfmarker}
Marketing: And the other one?
Industrial Designer: Wow.
Marketing: {vocalsound}
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Marketing: I think it's slightly better, um,
Project Manager: Ah. Mm.
Marketing: it's hard to tell from just the plasticine,
Project Manager: I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker}
Marketing: but {disfmarker}
Project Manager: When we want to include {disfmarker} I I I'm doubting about this this component.
Marketing: Mm.
Project Manager: It it it it breaks in your {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer:'Kay
Marketing: Mm.
Industrial Designer: maybe {disfmarker}
User Interface: No actually this is this is not going to protrude actually,
Marketing: Okay.
User Interface: it it's n i it is jus
Industrial Designer: It's not a button it's a led, it's a {disfmarker}
User Interface: It's a led actually which which'll be covering in a curve {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Ac actually yeah it should be embedded.
Project Manager: Mm, yes I see, mm okay.
Marketing: Mm-hmm. Yeah.
User Interface: It's {disfmarker} will be embedded there
Industrial Designer: Yeah. Oh
User Interface: so it won't be really you know protruding or something.
Industrial Designer: you can push push it again, you can push it.
Marketing: Yeah. The other thing is, is the left hand one protruding?
User Interface: Yeah.
Marketing:'Cause if people are left handed they want to use the other hand,
User Interface: Yeah. {vocalsound} Yeah.
Marketing: maybe it won't work so well.
User Interface: No you {disfmarker} it it not protruding actually, it will go in better into that {disfmarker}
Marketing: Okay.
Project Manager: Well r r
Marketing: I'd say two or three for that one, personally.
Project Manager: Mm.
Marketing: Probably more towards three than two.
Project Manager: I think the look is better
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: but the feel is is is worse. So so {vocalsound} I would also say this is four.
Marketing: Okay.
Project Manager: But w w do you {disfmarker} what do you think?
User Interface: Uh it's fine I think. My {disfmarker} just that um the feel is that um you {disfmarker} right now you you don't see the feel because right uh for example if you press it quite inside now like this, now it's embedded one.
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
Project Manager: Mm. Mm. Yes.
User Interface: This is how embedded one will {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Yes, it basically is the same shape.
User Interface: Yeah. It's a bas basically the same thing actually.
Project Manager: Mm-hmm. Mm.
User Interface: You will be {disfmarker} Except that in this c
Industrial Designer: And the L_C_D_ makes it better. Yeah.
User Interface: Yeah {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
User Interface: And {vocalsound} you might have a slight thing for to forward and {disfmarker}
Marketing: Mm, okay. Yeah
Industrial Designer: So I will say two.
Marketing: it's d it's definitely more fancier than that one.
Project Manager: Yes, okay {gap}.
User Interface: Yeah, yeah.
Industrial Designer: I would say two, three.
Marketing: Okay.
User Interface: Yeah.
Marketing: So, consensus? Two or three?
Project Manager: Two?
Marketing: Two?
Project Manager: Mm. Two's good
Industrial Designer: Yep.
Project Manager: yes.
User Interface: {gap} looking like {disfmarker}
Marketing: Um,'kay. Innovation. The first one, not really muc
Industrial Designer: Basically there is no innovation in the first one compared to what exists in the market,
Marketing: Mm. Yeah.
Industrial Designer: right?
Marketing: Do we {disfmarker}
User Interface: No but except for the design of the surf {vocalsound}.
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} Yeah. The surf uh design {vocalsound}.
Marketing: Mm.
Project Manager: Mm.
Marketing: What {disfmarker} What features are we actually including?
User Interface: You should be rea {vocalsound}
Marketing: Are we including like a location kind of thing like trying to find it?
User Interface: {vocalsound} Uh no
Marketing: There's nothing like that?
User Interface: I think it's more of the feel.
Marketing: But th is there any there's no actual innovation in that at all, it's just a straight-out remote control.
User Interface: Yeah, yeah.
Project Manager: Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.
User Interface: Yeah.
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
Marketing: Okay.
Project Manager: The only innova innovation is the shape.
Industrial Designer: Yeah {gap}.
User Interface: Say about that.
Marketing: Okay.
Project Manager: S so that {disfmarker}
Marketing: So there's no {disfmarker} this uh look and feel thing, though that's not a technological innovation.
Industrial Designer: Yeah. You're right {gap}.
User Interface: Yeah.
Marketing: So I'd be up for seven for innovation.
Industrial Designer: Yeah. And the {disfmarker} And the second one is really uh state of the art, uh in terms of innovation.
User Interface: Yep.
Project Manager: Mm.
Industrial Designer: And um with many more functionalities, and can open and close the the bottom part.
User Interface: Yeah, it gives it {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Yes. A and the L_C_D_ screen is {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
Project Manager: That's that's that's well it's quite innovative.
Industrial Designer: And all the scrolling uh buttons and menu and pro programmable device behind this.
Project Manager: Mm.
Industrial Designer: Uh could put it at one or two I would say. Personally.
Marketing: Okay.
Project Manager: Yeah. Mm. Mm. Mm. Mm.
User Interface: Yep.
Marketing: So what is it, what are the innovations with this? Got the L_C_D_ screen.
Industrial Designer: Uh {disfmarker} Yeah automatic speech recognition.
Marketing: Is that in this one though? Is this {disfmarker}'cause this is the {disfmarker} Th th there were different options we discussed then,
User Interface: No, we ha
Marketing: we discussed the one that was in budget and the one that was out of budget.
Project Manager: We just diske discuss it as you designed it
Marketing: Okay.
Project Manager: and then we will will try to get it in the budget.
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
Marketing: So the cost for these were {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: So {vocalsound} {disfmarker}
Marketing: what was the cost for the first one? Eight Euros?
Project Manager: Eight.
Industrial Designer: Eight. Well actually we have yeah to check again yeah.
User Interface: Yeah, eight Euros yeah.
Marketing: And this one was sixteen Euros.
Project Manager: Yes.
Industrial Designer: Sixteen.
User Interface: Sixteen Euros.
Marketing: Okay. So. Innovation for this one is two? One?
User Interface: It's a two, I would say two {gap}.
Marketing: Two?
Project Manager: Two.
Industrial Designer: W W un to be one what would do we nee actually, yeah, I don't see {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Why it is one.
Industrial Designer: okay, one would would be without buttons, {vocalsound}.
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: A man {disfmarker} w w
Marketing: Mm. Well
User Interface: Yeah.
Marketing: the speech recognition is a very good innovation I believe it,
Project Manager: Yes.
Industrial Designer: Bu
Marketing: so {gap}
Industrial Designer: Yeah. So maybe we can put one.
Project Manager: This this is it w with the speech recognition?
Industrial Designer: It's using speech recognition, yeah.
Project Manager: Well.
User Interface: Okay yeah.
Project Manager: Gi given that {vocalsound} that it works,
Marketing: Give it a one?
Industrial Designer: Yeah, one, yeah.
Marketing: Yep.
Project Manager: {vocalsound} then it's I think one.
Marketing: Okay.
Project Manager: {gap}
Marketing: Ease of use?
User Interface: {vocalsound} Uh {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: So the first one is really standard,
Marketing: Mm.
Industrial Designer: so everybody i including our grandmothers can use it,
User Interface: He is used to it act
Marketing: Yeah.
Project Manager: Mm.
Industrial Designer: right?
User Interface: They are used to it actually.
Marketing: Yep. So that's maybe a a two for ease of use.
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
User Interface: Here there may {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Um, the other one is quite easy, tho though.
User Interface: Uh, though it has more functionality I think it shouldn't be for the user to learn it actually. It shouldn't be diffi
Marketing: Okay. So maybe a three or a four.
Project Manager: Hmm.
User Interface: Uh yeah, actually in fact I think it will be {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: One me um we hope {disfmarker}
User Interface: Yeah {vocalsound} {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: maybe sometimes people get uh scared with the number of buttons.
Marketing: Mm.
User Interface: Yeah but {vocalsound} y
Industrial Designer: And there is a {disfmarker} like I would say three. Or maybe four {gap}.
Marketing: Okay. Consensus? Three or four?
User Interface: Well we have reduced the keys actually you see.
Project Manager: Three, I would. Three.
Marketing: Three? Okay.
Industrial Designer: Yeah, yeah
User Interface: Three is fine with me.
Industrial Designer: because it's n uh it's not like a big one with uh one hundred buttons or so, {gap} {disfmarker}
User Interface: Yeah it's a {disfmarker}
Project Manager: No.
User Interface: actually the user has to put some effort to do {disfmarker} use that actually,
Marketing: Mm-hmm.
User Interface: it's not so easy, like this one the normal.
Project Manager: Yeah. Yes but then when when he is used to it, i i it is quite easy.
User Interface: Is quite easy yeah.
Project Manager: So so I think th three is good. Yeah.
User Interface: Initially there there is a lot of effort, yeah.
Marketing: Okay.
Project Manager: Good.
Marketing: So three's
Project Manager: What's the next?
Marketing: uh how well it goes to the target demographic. So we're d we're still thinking twenty to forty year olds?
Project Manager: So {disfmarker}
User Interface: Mm.
Project Manager: Twe twenty to forty, yes that's {disfmarker}
Marketing: That's {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: This one would be uh for grandmothers {vocalsound}.
Marketing: Mm.
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
User Interface: Oh no, this would I
Industrial Designer: No.
User Interface: I would I would give this model to the old people actually.
Industrial Designer: Yeah, grandmothers, yeah.
User Interface: Yeah.
Marketing: So sh completely changed our demographic there,
Project Manager: Mm-hmm.
User Interface: And {disfmarker}
Marketing: it's not part of the the funky young thing.
Project Manager: Well exce except for the surfing shape. I mean that's that's something which which has an appeal on this group I think,
Industrial Designer: Yeah that's true. Yeah.
Marketing: Yeah. If it was the very bottom price range or it was like between this and another one we did the same thing then I can imagine it being {disfmarker} applying to the the demographic
Project Manager: but {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
Marketing: yeah. That's {disfmarker} it's still {disfmarker} Ye
Project Manager: Mm w w w we {disfmarker} after this we can can consider uh for instance, making this more attractive to to the demographic
Marketing: Mm.'Cause we have got room, we've got some budget there to add a few things to it,
Project Manager: Mm.
Marketing: that's right.
Project Manager: But as it is now, I w would say mm, six, something.
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
Marketing: Mm-hmm.
User Interface: Oh yeah, {gap}.
Marketing: And {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Do you agree?
User Interface: I {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Yeah because it's so important {disfmarker} it's i it was written that it really so important, the um the the look and uh taking care of its {disfmarker} it targets, the right range of people,
User Interface: Well I think {disfmarker}
Marketing: Mm.
Industrial Designer: right?
User Interface: Yeah. Uh yeah but but if you sell it in the market it's going to be cheap, actually.
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
Marketing: But it's going to be cheap whatever though,
Industrial Designer: But w
User Interface: So {disfmarker}
Marketing: it was set with i we've got a set price.
User Interface: And people can still decide to use the cheaper one
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
User Interface: instead of a {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: But for us it's {vocalsound} yeah {vocalsound} we have a constraint that we need to sell at twenty five Euros.
Project Manager: Mm, yeah, indeed.
Marketing: Yeah. There's nothing that would make me spend an extra k few Euros on that one rather than another one.
Industrial Designer: {gap} Yeah.
Project Manager: Ju just think, twenty five Euros, I mean it's not going to be cheaper.
User Interface: Okay.
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
User Interface: Okay. So in that case well it's fine then.
Marketing: Okay. Um
Project Manager: Mm. Mm. Okay.
User Interface: We can {disfmarker} yeah.
Marketing: and the demokraphi demographic of the second one?
User Interface: And the demographics of {disfmarker}
Marketing: It's got the got the the toys in it, it's got the L_C_D_ screen
Project Manager: Yeah tha tha tha tha tha that's {disfmarker}
Marketing: and {disfmarker}
Project Manager: I think it's better,
Marketing: Mm.
Project Manager: because of the L_C_D_ screen which is really an appeal on the on the on the
Marketing: Yeah.
Project Manager: on the {gap} and on the {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Yeah. And if you want to target {disfmarker} yeah if we we wish to to sell four millions of this, I think for this audience we need absolutely the L_C_D_ screen.
Marketing: Mm-hmm.
Project Manager: Mm. So, the L_C_D_ screen uh attracts,
Marketing: Yeah.
Project Manager: yes.
Marketing: I think especially if we're gonna n have an L_C_D_ screen on a low range product then that's good.
Project Manager: Because it {disfmarker} Mm, ma maybe that's something to consider, yes {vocalsound},
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
Marketing: Mm. Okay.
Project Manager: so. Wh what {disfmarker} what {disfmarker}
Marketing: I'd probably go with three again for that one.
User Interface: Yeah I think it's uh {disfmarker} it has more market actually.
Industrial Designer: Or even {disfmarker} Even one and two. Or two.
Marketing: Mm-hmm.
Project Manager: No s say t two.
User Interface: Y yeah, you know {disfmarker}
Marketing: Okay. So, two, yeah?
User Interface: two.
Project Manager: Two?
Industrial Designer: Yeah. Two yeah.
User Interface: Yeah two yeah. Because tomorrow this will be more appealing because you can add {vocalsound} lot of sophistication on that.
Marketing: Mm-hmm.
User Interface: Because then you you have it uh d you have lot of things which you can include
Marketing: Yeah. Yep. And especially I guess'cause this has the speech recognition as well,
User Interface: for the people to {disfmarker}
Marketing: and that makes it more appealing, it's more of a a new fun toy.
User Interface: We have to practically test it.
Marketing: Mm-hmm.
User Interface: The field test will tell you how good. {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
Marketing: Okay.
Project Manager: Okay, the final point, trends.
Marketing: And following the trends.
User Interface: The trends.
Marketing: So the trends were the fruit and vegetables and the spongy feel.
Project Manager: Mm. Mm. {vocalsound}
Marketing: So as it is, not really doing either of them.
Project Manager: I think {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Spongy, uh, that means that it goes in in the water. {vocalsound}
Marketing: Well,
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
Marketing: the spongy could be part of the the feel of the buttons as well,
User Interface: Mm-hmm.
Marketing: I know some {disfmarker} have you tried the mobile phones that have got the kinda spongy buttons and {disfmarker} not not exactly spongy but I'm thinking one of the Nokias that's got like you ca it hasn't got individual buttons
Industrial Designer: Uh okay.
Marketing: it's got just a one bit on it
Project Manager: Mm.
User Interface: Yeah I know.
Marketing: and so you can {disfmarker} that feels kinda spongy.
Industrial Designer: But this one includes this feature, right? Spongy buttons.
Marketing: So it's sort of, yeah.
User Interface: Yeah. We we we we we yeah, it's the way they are going to be, actually.
Marketing: Mm. Okay.
Industrial Designer: So {disfmarker} Uh
Project Manager: Mm.
Industrial Designer: the maybe in the colour we can make it uh fruit and and veggie.
Marketing: But that's if you're using the covers.
Project Manager: And the then we can al
Marketing: Or is it just one {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
Project Manager: yes. We can {disfmarker} we can consider uh uh is it possible do you think, to to make a cover for s such a phone? I mean {disfmarker}
Marketing: Well they make it for mobiles, it can't be that much more complicated.
User Interface: But why do you want to cover that actually? In that uh w in the mod
Project Manager: Well just with the with the flexible plastic uh {disfmarker}
Marketing: So you got the option of having different colours or different textures.
Industrial Designer: Yeah. This is possible.
Project Manager: I th I th I think {gap} {disfmarker}
User Interface: Uh uh y are you sure? Yeah I think yeah it should be possible like what we do with the mobile phone, yeah.
Project Manager: O o or just two things which can be put on each other.
Marketing: Mm. {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: Yeah exactly like Nokia phones {vocalsound}.
Marketing: Mm.
Project Manager: {vocalsound} Yes, exactly like it.
User Interface: Yep.
Project Manager: Uh, so Maybe we can {vocalsound} but we have to decide it, we can put the the {vocalsound} the fancy f look of vegetables for instance, to to these covers
Marketing: Mm-hmm.
Project Manager: and s now try to invest in the in in the features.
Marketing: I think the {disfmarker} if we do the cover that's really going with the company's philosophy of having the fashion in in electronics, it lets people have the latest fashion
Project Manager: Mm.
Marketing: even next year when fruit and vegetables might be out, you'll still be able to put a new cover on it and then it'll still be in fashion.
Project Manager: Mm mm mm mm mm.
Industrial Designer: Yeah.'Cause sometimes look at this computer, th this laptop, it's all black,
Marketing: Mm.
Industrial Designer: and uh it's quite conventional, and sometimes people don't like too much flashy colours like this one presented here.
Marketing: Mm. Mm.
Industrial Designer: So maybe we could do like in the range the set of what we propose a black one, very standard one, that meets the the requirements of th such people that want really standard uh things.
Marketing: Mm. Yep.
Project Manager: Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.
Marketing: Yep. Mm.
Project Manager: Mm. Mm.
Marketing: And then you have the option of having the different colours, different covers.
Project Manager: Yes. So so so that that would make the trends equal,
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
Project Manager: so we we we really have {disfmarker} don't have,
Marketing: Mm. There's n yeah.'Cause that's the that's the feature that could be included in either of them.
Project Manager: I mean {disfmarker}
Marketing: Although it is more with the spongy buttons on the um on the other one.
Project Manager: Yes, indeed.
Industrial Designer: Yeah, so a a point better for the for the number two {vocalsound}.
Marketing: Okay. So. Two and three, or one and two?
Project Manager: Yes.
Marketing: {gap}
User Interface: Yeah, it's one.
Project Manager: Say, say one and two. One and two.
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Marketing: Mm-hmm.
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} Okay.
Project Manager: So le le let's see. So d
Marketing: Okay.
Project Manager: this one has spongy but buttons?
Industrial Designer: Yeah, the blue one uh spongy.
User Interface: Yeah, it says a {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Mm, I see, yes okay. Good.
Marketing: Okay so the average of that is three six nine divided by five, so five {disfmarker} mm nine by five, one point s eight?
Project Manager: Just add it.
Industrial Designer: Nine.
Project Manager: You know. Three, six, seven.
User Interface: One point six, one point {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: {gap}
User Interface: One point eight yeah.
Marketing: This one, eleven thirteen nineteen twenty one, divided by five is four point two
User Interface: Four point {disfmarker} Uh four point two.
Marketing: yep.
Industrial Designer: Very good.
Marketing: Okay. But we still got a very different price for those two so they're not really comparable yet anyway.
Project Manager: Mm-hmm. We {disfmarker} we must try to get them closer.
Industrial Designer: Yeah, it's right, yeah that's right.
Marketing: {vocalsound} Yep.
Project Manager: Both in i i
User Interface: Wow.
Project Manager: or we just have to choose. And adapt.
Marketing: Yep.
Project Manager: Because, when we choose for this one we have to {vocalsound} we have to make it more attractive
Marketing: {vocalsound} Mm-hmm.
Project Manager: and w when we {gap} to d for this one we have to make it more cheap.
Marketing: Well it's easier to just make that one cheaper by just taking the speech recognition out.
Project Manager: {vocalsound} Yes, well {disfmarker} {vocalsound}
Marketing: That'll basically take us down to the budget.
Project Manager: But I'm {vocalsound} now {disfmarker} did y did you work with the same prices that I have here?
Industrial Designer: So I I give yeah I just give a call with the manufacturer uh and uh I explained them and they told me this could be possible for sixteen Fr Euros.
Project Manager: Mm.
Industrial Designer: Uh unfortunately we didn't see this chip, uh Matthew,
User Interface: Yeah. Yep.
Project Manager: Mm, tha
Industrial Designer: so maybe we have to recap with this one.
User Interface: Maybe we ought to reconsider everything with this, yeah.
Project Manager: Well yes, well uh re reconsider it. So {vocalsound} let's let's try to to model this this phone in this sheet,
User Interface: Mm-hmm.
Project Manager: uh what kind of energy source uh I I {disfmarker} we didn't speak about that. It's a {disfmarker} it's a normal battery, or {disfmarker}
User Interface: Yeah, it migh It {disfmarker} it'll need uh more than a conventional one, it won't be uh just {disfmarker} maybe you might use a A_A_ battery actually. What do you say, Mael?
Industrial Designer: For this one it's a normal battery {gap}.
Project Manager: Yes. Just so one battery.'Kay. Electronics. {gap} given speech recognition I think w you should go for the less fancy chip.
User Interface: Yeah.
Industrial Designer: Uh sample speaker, yeah.
Project Manager: Yeah, yes, or sample sensor, yes.
Industrial Designer: Sample, yeah, this one.
Project Manager: Yes, this one. Okay. Case? Um,
Industrial Designer: So {disfmarker}
User Interface: Curved. Double curved yeah right.
Project Manager: {vocalsound} I see {disfmarker} {vocalsound} I
User Interface: It's uh {disfmarker}
Marketing: Mm.
Project Manager: Double curve.
Marketing: Yeah, it's gonna be more than just the biggest case, definitely.
Project Manager: {gap} Mm.
Industrial Designer: So which one are we talking to?
User Interface: Are you talking about this or that?
Industrial Designer: Well {disfmarker}
Marketing: Either of them.
Project Manager: Oh yes, we are talking about, but they have the same shape,
User Interface: Mm-hmm.
Marketing: Mm. They're both going to be not basic cases.
Project Manager: but, actually bu
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
Project Manager: So th th this would be double curves?
Marketing: Mm-hmm.
User Interface: Yeah.
Project Manager:'Kay. Uh, plastic would be the material.
Marketing: Yeah. The basic one, yep.
Industrial Designer: Is it zero Franc? {vocalsound}
User Interface: A special colour? {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Uh special colour, now we leave it to the covers.
User Interface: Uh {disfmarker}
Marketing: So now we're either going button or L_C_D_s, L_C_D_ display.
Project Manager: Push. Mm, yes, but {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: L_C_D_ is {gap}. It's okay. Just say L_C_D_ {gap}.
Marketing: Is that price per unit, or for the whole thing?
Project Manager: Yeah th now this is per per unit, this number of components.
User Interface: Ah good.
Marketing: So it would need twelve buttons.
User Interface: Yeah, we might need a scroll wheel, right, for that?
Industrial Designer: No but for this one it's twelve Euro.
User Interface: No, for that one also.
Industrial Designer: There are twelve?
Project Manager: So, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine,
User Interface: Yeah that's a scroll.
Project Manager: t Yes. Twelve I believe. So this comes to eighteen.
Marketing: Mm. And that's without any special button supplements.
User Interface: Yeah, one scroll wheel you might need.
Project Manager: So {disfmarker}
Marketing: So we'd have a special colour, special form and special material on all of them. They're not just standard buttons.
User Interface: Uh {disfmarker}
Project Manager: So I think {disfmarker} but th do you agree th that thi
Industrial Designer: Wait a minute, it's not it's not double curved, it's single curved, right? Because it's {disfmarker} there is no like {vocalsound}.
Marketing: But I thought it would be curved on two {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Yes I
Marketing: it's like it's curved on the sides and curved on the top and bottom as well, that's what I thought.
Project Manager: Yes I'm I'm no I'm no I'm not sh sure.
Industrial Designer: Well
Project Manager: Yes I kno undes I understand what you mean, yes.
Industrial Designer: it's {gap} you know this curve like this so, it's w there is only is is is there is nothing like y you know in the other stuff there are {disfmarker}
Marketing: You talking about concave curves?
Project Manager: Uh-huh.
Industrial Designer: yeah concave.
Project Manager: Both.
Industrial Designer: So I think we can put um {disfmarker}
Marketing: You think a single curved?
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} the single curved in the sixteen. That makes uh seventeen. And what are just {disfmarker} The bt buttons, we have twelve buttons, are you sure? Yeah. {vocalsound}
Marketing: Mm.
Project Manager: Yes. {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Uh {disfmarker}
Marketing: We have more, we've got those {disfmarker} the scroll wheel on the side
Industrial Designer: So
Marketing: and yeah {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: I had a bad uh bad estimation.
User Interface: Bad estimate,
Marketing: The sc
Project Manager: W {vocalsound} d {vocalsound}
User Interface: right?
Project Manager: we have {disfmarker} we haven't talk about a {gap}, but that's no a {gap} is very exp inexpensive I believe
Marketing: Mm.
Project Manager: but it is not in the list.
Marketing: We've got a scroll wheel for the volume don't we, or is it some other thing that's not on there.
Project Manager: W ho h is this a scroll wheel or is this a a a sort of button which can be pressed on two sides uh so for higher and lower? {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: No no no.
Marketing:'Kay we've only got five minutes left guys so we need to wrap it up pretty fast.
Industrial Designer: Yes, a kind of scroll wheel.
Marketing: So this is even more than the um than the cost you gave, the sixteen Euros.
Project Manager: Mm. Mm-hmm.
Industrial Designer: Okay,
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: so based on that, yeah, um where is the es okay sample speaker {disfmarker}
User Interface: That is the sample sensor and sample speaker.
Project Manager: So {disfmarker} um {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: But still, yeah it {gap}
User Interface: We just need that actually. We need one.
Project Manager: We're {disfmarker} We {disfmarker} We could go for the for the for the for the for a simple chip, but then we can't have the the speech recognition, yes? Yes?
Industrial Designer: No we cannot, yeah.
Project Manager: So so w when we w a
Industrial Designer: So {disfmarker}
User Interface: S
Project Manager: this would this would be cutting the speech recognition.
Industrial Designer: But the um {disfmarker} Yeah but if you have the {disfmarker} near the L_C_D_ you can um {vocalsound} choose {disfmarker} select between um you know like uni universal between audio, T_V_ and V_C_R_, and this needs a needs a advanced chip.
Project Manager: Transti
Industrial Designer: Right, Matthew?
User Interface: Oh I {disfmarker} {vocalsound} i it {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Or regular chip?
User Interface: I think it's going to be {disfmarker} y y
Industrial Designer: I think yeah regular, today we you can do that with regular chip.
User Interface: yeah it's th with the regular chip, yeah.
Project Manager: Say {gap} say it's regular, regular chip,
Industrial Designer: Yeah. Okay. Okay.
Project Manager: and we still on fifteen,
User Interface: Yeah.
Project Manager: so {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: So. And what about the number of buttons buttons uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} my Matthew?
Project Manager: Yes but that {disfmarker} maybe {disfmarker} Well we can just say
User Interface: Uh {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: {gap}
Project Manager: one.
Industrial Designer: When you look at this w, this u uh item, {disfmarker}
User Interface: Yeah.
Project Manager: Ca l we are just {disfmarker} when we just want to uh to cut the number of buttons we have to make seven to to fit in in twelve twelve fifty.
Industrial Designer: But {vocalsound} {disfmarker}
Project Manager: So is it possible?
Marketing: {vocalsound} But that's seven basic buttons right, seven buttons without any adds-on, without special colours or form or material.
Project Manager: Mm-hmm.
User Interface: That'll be {disfmarker} then we have uh have to ask the user to press it several times.
Industrial Designer: You cannot make a phone to your boss saying twelve fifty is really {vocalsound} really low,
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: No no,
Marketing: Well {disfmarker}
Project Manager: he he he I I
Industrial Designer: no?
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Marketing: So {gap} the L_C_D_ display is is three Francs, sorry three Euros, by itself.
Project Manager: Mm-hmm.
Industrial Designer: And uh we don't want to to change that right? We we really want a L_C_D_
User Interface: Uh {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Mm-hmm.
Industrial Designer: other otherwise we w wouldn not get the market.
Project Manager: Otherwise y you ha you have a s ve very normal uh thing like this.
Industrial Designer: It's evident.
Marketing: Mm.
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
Marketing: So twelve Euro fifty, we got two off of the battery,
Industrial Designer: And I dunno {disfmarker}
Marketing: we can't do anything about that, so ten fifty, if we want an L_C_D_ dispra display, that's seven fifty um, so we've got seven fifty to use for the case and for the buttons. And the chip.
Project Manager: Mm.
Marketing: Sorry the chip's up there already.
Project Manager: Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.
Marketing: So we're gonna have to scale this down to get within budget, there's no doubt about that.
Project Manager: {vocalsound} A
Industrial Designer: So wha what what each of us think about the {disfmarker} because it's measure point the L_C_D_, um {disfmarker} Do you think it's important?
User Interface: Or we could even replace them by buttons actually.
Industrial Designer: Because sometimes whe when you watch the T_V_ in fact, you have a big display and maybe you don't need one more in your hands? I dunno, I'm just asking.
Marketing: Mm.
Project Manager: Mm {disfmarker}
User Interface: A actually it depends, it depends what kind of functionalities you want to add into it,
Marketing: Yep.
User Interface: for example if you add two more functionalities then better you add two more buttons, or {disfmarker} and you'll have L_C_D_ display which is {disfmarker} that is going to bring the cost by two two Euros at least.
Marketing: Mm. Yeah. I think, unless we can really drive these prices down we need to get rid of the L_C_D_ display.
User Interface: Okay so we can get rid of it
Industrial Designer: Yeah, it's true yeah.
User Interface: and then add a couple of buttons.
Industrial Designer: But uh, do we want that? On the market point of view, yeah. What do you think uh, L_C_D_ is a major feature, or?
Project Manager: Mm. I
Marketing: For the price, it's gonna be what we can afford, and it's looking like we can't afford the L_C_D_ display, there's no way we can get it in there. {vocalsound} Mm.
Project Manager: I {gap} think we have to come to a decision now, just I I think we we what we just do i is vote about the uh the L_C_D_ uh display
Marketing: Mm-hmm.
Project Manager: so {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: You assume, you want a democratic voyt vote,
Project Manager: Yes.
Industrial Designer: right? Okay.
Project Manager: Yes. Yes. {vocalsound} One man one vote.
Industrial Designer: Okay.
Project Manager: {vocalsound} S so who thinks the the L_C_D_ disply display should be i should be in it?
Marketing: I th I'd like t it to be in but I can't see it happening. I can't see it fitting in.
Project Manager: Mm. Mm-hmm mm-hmm. {vocalsound}
User Interface: I think but {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} We need to be. {vocalsound}
Marketing: Bu y you're a power voter {disfmarker} uh veto anyway as Project Manager.
Project Manager: Mm-hmm, I know, but {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Yeah. {gap}.
User Interface: Yeah but the only thing is that what is the multiple functionalities you want to include with that.
Marketing: {gap} well we have to make a decision now, that's it.
Project Manager: Yes.
User Interface: Yeah.
Project Manager: So uh uh having an L_C_D_ s display is just uh uh have very very limited amount of buttons. Is that acceptable? Ca can I have {disfmarker} can the functions be implement in an {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Yes.
Project Manager: You've {disfmarker} you you agree.
User Interface: W I I I just {disfmarker}
Project Manager: So hav hav having seven buttons, instead of twelve.
User Interface: Yeah.
Project Manager: So that wou would be cutting cutting suh say about these buttons {vocalsound}.
Industrial Designer: Because one yeah th show me that uh actually we could in fact we move these three buttons and have three uh possibilities for each of the three here. Here one, at the middle, and at the bottom.
Project Manager: Mm.
Marketing: Mm. I think then we we're really losing ease of use.
Industrial Designer: Okay, {gap}.
User Interface: That will create another problem. For the people to use it. It's not going to be easy. Doing that.
Marketing: Okay.
Project Manager: Mm. So um
Industrial Designer: Okay.
Project Manager: I I think we should we should cut the L_C_D_ screen. That that's that's my opinion.
User Interface: No, it's okay, you uh cut the L_C_D_ screen
Project Manager: Just {disfmarker}
User Interface: and introduce two more buttons.
Marketing: Okay. So L_C_D_'s out, is speech rec out now? We've {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: The speech recognition is out. Because of the budget, yeah.
Marketing: Yep.
Project Manager: Uh where, L_C_ {disfmarker}
Marketing: Yep.
Project Manager: Okay w we now we can just uh {disfmarker}
Marketing: So are we basically back to the original one now, back to the first version? Which turns out to be on budget exactly, pretty much. With these new costings.
User Interface: Yeah.
Industrial Designer: Yes.
Marketing: So {gap} just look at {disfmarker} forget that one and look at that one now.
Project Manager: Yes. Yes. I th I th I think w we just go for this one
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
Marketing: Mm.
Project Manager: and that that now twelve Euros is the is is the price,
Marketing: Yep.
Project Manager: okay.
Marketing: Okay. Well that's that's {disfmarker}
Project Manager: My m my supervisor will be glad that it's fifty cents cheaper than he expected.
Marketing: Yep.
Industrial Designer: Actually yeah,
Marketing: So.
Industrial Designer: we we we will not need the really uh expert designers um because the amount, yeah.
Marketing: Mm.
User Interface: Yeah.
Marketing: Yep. So w we can go back and l talk to the suppliers maybe
Project Manager: Okay.
Marketing: and see if we can drive the prices down to add a few more things in but that's all we can do with the restrictions we have at the moment.
Project Manager: Okay, good. Then we {gap} the same. Thank you.
User Interface: Okay.
Project Manager: That was it. {vocalsound}
Marketing: Mm-hmm.
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} Thanks.
User Interface: That's it. Cool.
Marketing: Okay.","Both the devices had the special shape, like the surf-board. The first prototype was a pretty simple design with LCD display and an on-off button in red. It was easy to use and could only be used for the TV mode. After all, the team concluded that it was a standard design except for its special shape that made it look adorable. On the contrary, the second prototype was advanced in its speech recognition function and looked like a fashion mobile phone. It came with six key buttons and one orange one for the microphone. If the user would like a speech recognition and a lot of information on the channel could be displayed directly on LCD display. Also, the components for the two designs were low in weight and there was LED to indicate the battery usage, making it convenient to use. To conclude, Marketing fancied the second one's size and shape.",qmsum

Lynne Neagle AM: Good morning, everyone. Welcome to the Children, Young People and Education Committee this morning. I've received no apologies for absence. Can I ask Members if there are any declarations of interest, please? No. Okay, thank you. Item 2 this morning is our scrutiny session on Estyn's annual report 2018-19. I'm very pleased to welcome Meilyr Rowlands, Her Majesty's Chief Inspector, Estyn; Jassa Scott, strategic director at Estyn; and Claire Morgan, strategic director at Estyn. Thank you all for attending. We're looking forward to hearing what you've got to say. We'll go straight into questions from Suzy Davies.
Suzy Davies AM: Bore da. Good morning, everybody. Thank you for the papers upfront, in which you say that the most striking feature of the education system, looking forward, of course is the curriculum and the change that that's bringing. How can we be sure that, during this period of change, standards don't slip? And also, from the point of view of scrutiny, will we be back in a situation where we're being told,'You can't compare one set of results against the previous year's results, because of the nature of the change'?
Meilyr Rowlands: Bore da, bawb. Thank you for the invitation to come here. I think that's a good question. I think any kind of major educational reform has got risks attached to it, particularly if those changes were made too quickly. I think this process of reform has been going on in the background for a few years now, so I think there is a track record of standards and provision not slipping. We've seen small incremental improvements. So, overall, I think we can be fairly confident that standards won't slip during this period of preparation.
Suzy Davies AM: Can I just ask: is that based on your evidence around primary schools, where the sort of ethos that we've seen in the curriculum has been already articulated through the foundation phase?
Meilyr Rowlands: The track record I'm talking about is across the board, so it's very difficult to think of anything that's actually got worse over the last three or four years, so it's difficult to say that standards of provision is slipping. It might not be improving as quickly as we would like, but the purpose of major curriculum and, more generally, educational reform is to make sure that we do get a more substantial sort of improvement. I think we should congratulate the profession for the work they've been doing. A large number of schools and teachers and leaders have been part of preparing the new curriculum and all the associated work, as well as doing the day job. I think their commitment and their engagement with curriculum reform, and engagement with wider education reform, is to be congratulated. So, I think going forward, we must make sure that that is continued; that this process that's called co-construction--engaging with the profession, making sure that they're behind all the changes--continues. I think that's what's going to make sure that we don't see any slippage.
Suzy Davies AM: Okay, and on that point of comparing year on year, we will be able to make those comparisons legitimately then?
Meilyr Rowlands: Yes, certainly, in terms of our inspection outcomes and our inspection work, yes.
Suzy Davies AM: Okay. That's great, thank you. Can I just ask you then about the difference in preparedness between primary and secondary schools, which I've just mentioned previously, and also what your views are on the impact of funding for schools on that as well? Because we're in a situation where a number of primary schools have got surplus funds, sometimes that's because of end of year additional funds just being magicked up, but there is a serious worry that so many secondary schools are in deficit and that, overall, secondary schools are in deficit. Is there a correlation between those two positions, that secondary schools may be less ready for this than primary schools?
Meilyr Rowlands: I think it's probably true to say that secondary schools have a greater challenge than primary schools generally in terms of preparedness for the new curriculum. I think that's why we welcomed the phasing in of the new curriculum. With any sort of education reform, you've got that danger of people wanting to see change as soon as possible on the one hand, and on the other hand you need time to pilot things, to make sure that people have the right professional learning and make sure that there's opportunity for evaluation and thinking and so forth. So, we've got to get that balance right.
Suzy Davies AM: Sorry, that could be difficult to do if a school doesn't have money to create that space, couldn't it?
Meilyr Rowlands: Yes. You raised two issues, I think. One, about the difference between primary and secondary: I think what I'm saying there is I think the fact that the new curriculum is going to be brought in for all the years in primary, but it's going to be phased in year by year for secondary is a recognition of that difference. In terms of funding, probably everyone in this room, and certainly me included, would like to see more money for the education system--any educationalist would like to see that. But, you know, that is a decision for local and central Government to decide how much they can afford. I think there is an argument for saying that the funding has become more challenging for schools over time.
Suzy Davies AM: Can I ask, just to keep it on track, are you finding that that's having an impact on secondary schools particularly--their ability to make space to get their heads around the curriculum?
Meilyr Rowlands: I don't think you can make that straightforward correlation. But if you do look at surpluses and reserves, they have been more or less constant for primary schools over a long period of time, but they have declined for secondary schools. So, I think there probably is an argument for saying that we need to look at the funding of secondary schools in particular because, overall, they're in deficit now. So, I think there is an argument for looking at that. The other thing that's worth saying about funding is that even a small decrease in real terms can be disproportionately time consuming to manage. So, you know, if you have a large school and you have to maybe make one member of staff redundant, it can have a real big effect on the morale in the school. But also the time it takes for the headteacher and the senior staff to make those decisions can take their eye off the educational ball because they're looking at these financial and staffing issues.
Suzy Davies AM: Okay, thank you. Sian might develop that a little bit further on. The final question from me is: there's a general concern about the number of teachers that we have in the system at the moment, particularly at secondary level and in particular subjects as well. How do you think we can improve that? What impact is it likely to have on the ability of secondary schools to really get a grip on this?
Meilyr Rowlands: Obviously, the most important resource for the education system is the teachers. So, it is a concern that recruitment is getting more and more difficult and that targets for initial teacher training are not being hit. And we're not seeing them hit, if I remember correctly, even in primary, let alone secondary. So, there is a challenge, and I think we've got to look at this in the round. We've got to make sure that we have both a long-term strategy and a shorter term strategy for this. So, long term, we've got to make sure that education is an attractive option for young people and more mature people to want to go into. So, that is partly to do with workload and staff well-being. I think there's a general acceptance now that that needs to be higher up on the agenda, that people need to take that seriously, and there's work going on regarding the workload issue.
Suzy Davies AM: I suppose what I'm coming to, and I will finish with this, Chair, is, we're asking our existing workforce to undertake a fair bit of continuous professional development--let's call it that--in order to get ready for this curriculum when they've barely got time for lunch as it is. Do you think that's going to have an impact on the ability of secondary schools to get to grips with this, albeit that there'll be a phasing in?
Meilyr Rowlands: Yes. I think it will have an effect, but I think it'll have a positive effect. I think the new curriculum, one of the things about the new curriculum is that it re-professionalises the profession. It gives back agency and ownership to teachers. I think it's really important. And one of the reasons why teaching maybe hasn't been that attractive a profession is that teachers in the past have just been delivering a set curriculum, and now they've got a much more creative part in deciding for themselves how to teach something and what to teach. So, I think that is a very important part of attracting intelligent people into the profession. There are short-term things we need to do, of course, as well. I think we need to have a much more varied set of routes into teaching, so I welcome some of the part-time Open University courses, for example. So, there are lots of ways--we were talking about maybe converting people from primary into secondary, particularly in Welsh-medium, where there's a shortage. So, all those kinds of varied routes, I think, into teaching, are important as well.
Suzy Davies AM: Degree apprenticeships, potentially.
Meilyr Rowlands: Yes, I think it's well worth exploring that. Yes.
Suzy Davies AM: Lovely. Thank you. Thank you, Chair.
Lynne Neagle AM: Okay. Sian Gwenllian now has some questions on secondary schools causing concern. Sian.
Sian Gwenllian AM: Yes. Just before going on to that, just to pick up on that last point that you made about the shortage of teachers and losing teachers during the first year of their training. Has Estyn done any themed work on that particular issue, or do you intend to do anything on that? Also, looking at the financial incentives and how they compare with the situation in England, for example; do we need, perhaps, to think about financial incentives, not just for specific subjects, but for going to schools where there are particular issues, perhaps?
Meilyr Rowlands: Well, yes, there are currently discussions ongoing between us and the Government about working in those early years for teachers. It's possible that we will be undertaking work in the near future on that. I know that Professor Mick Waters is looking at this currently, and we've had the discussion with him. And I think we would welcome the opportunity to look at this particular period. Now, we are, of course, looking at initial teacher training, but we haven't looked at the first couple of years for many a year.
Sian Gwenllian AM: Right, thank you very much. And for your information, I've commissioned a piece of work on that particular issue, and that work will be published in due course. So, I hope to have a discussion with you about that.
Meilyr Rowlands: Thank you very much. Yes.
Sian Gwenllian AM: In terms of the secondary schools, that's where the problem lies, isn't it, rather than the primary sector. How much of a concern is it to you that children's chances of going to a secondary school that is good or better appear to be 50: 50, and that, indeed, over 10 per cent of secondary schools are judged to be failing and 12 per cent are under Estyn review? How much of a concern is that to you?
Meilyr Rowlands: Well, it is of concern to us, of course. I hope that we will have an opportunity to talk about the positive aspects of the education system in Wales, because there are a number of good things we can report also. The primary sector, the special sector, post-16--there are many sectors that are doing well, and I think a story that's particularly positive this year is that we have seen pupil referral units improving. We have seen examples of excellent practice in that sector for the first time in many a year, and we've also seen excellent practice in independent special schools, which is also a sector--. Because these are two sectors where there are very, very vulnerable children in attendance. So, I think that's very encouraging. But, you're right, of course, the biggest concern for the system, I would say, is secondary schools, and that is an issue of leadership, and also of the quality of the teaching and learning. Those are the recommendations that we make most often in our inspection reports. So, I believe that there is a need to find a long-term solution, as I mentioned previously, and also a short-term solution to this problem. In the long term, to improve the quality of teaching and learning--well, that's the main aim of the new curriculum. So, I am confident that that strategy is the right strategy. It will take time, as we mentioned previously; it will take longer in secondary schools, and that's for a number of reasons, and I have discussed the challenges that are additional for secondary schools in previous annual reports. So, there are many reasons why secondary schools find it more difficult, possibly, than primary schools. The children themselves are older and they have greater challenges. Life is more complicated for them, possibly. It's more difficult to engage with the parents of older children than younger children, and that's an important factor. That's one of the reasons why I believe it's important that we do have community schools that ensure that the parents are part of the school's life and take an interest in the education of their children. We also know that qualifications take a very prominent role in secondary schools'mindsets, and, in some cases, perhaps excessively so. So, we need to ensure that those qualifications are reformed as a result of the reform of the curriculum, and, of course, Qualifications Wales is carrying out that work currently. And also, we need to change the measures that we use to measure the schools'successes. Now, there is work ongoing on that as well. But there are all kinds of variations and differences between the primary and secondary sectors. In primary schools, for example, the greatest and most obvious difference, I would say, is that you've got one teacher who looks after a child for a whole year, and that teacher can identify the needs of the pupil very well over a period of time, getting to know the child and, possibly, the family very well. It's much more complicated for secondary school to do that; there have to be systems put in place for that. So, there are many long-term things that we need to respond to. But in the short term, what is important is that those schools that cause concern receive much more support, and that is why I am glad and do welcome what's being piloted currently, which is a system of supporting these schools, the multi-agency approach, that is. So, that is something that we have been calling for for quite a long period of time and piloted ourselves a few years ago. So, I'm very glad that we are doing this in secondary schools throughout Wales. I believe there are about 12 schools that are in that pilot scheme.
Sian Gwenllian AM: You said previously that it's a cause of concern for you that these schools that are failing or underachieving are not identified early enough. Are there signs that that's improving?
Meilyr Rowlands: Well, one of the things that's very positive about this pilot scheme is that it's not just the schools that are officially causing concern that are a part of the pilot scheme, that is, the schools that we have identified, through inspections, as needing to be put in a statutory category. So, there are schools involved in the pilot scheme that the authorities and the consortia have identified themselves as schools that are at risk of causing concern. I believe that it's fair to say that we have not reached a point yet where we have a system of agreed criteria in relation to identifying these schools yet. I think that there has been initial work that has been commissioned or that is about to arrive in relation to that, and the types of measures you would expect us to take account of would be dissatisfaction from parents, staff leaving, a change in leadership. We use surveys with the children, for instance, and that gives you quite a good idea of whether a school is possibly facing difficulties. So, there's not one single criteria alone that will tell you,'This is a school that is at risk of causing concern', but taken together, having a set of criteria that everyone has agreed would be a good way of monitoring schools, I believe.
Sian Gwenllian AM: Okay. Well, we'll be coming on to that middle tier later on, and perhaps that's where the problem lies, namely that if there isn't an agreed system from consortia and yourselves, perhaps that's where the focus needs to be.
Meilyr Rowlands: I would say that it's not the identification of the schools that is the greatest problem. The greatest problem is ensuring that there is support for them and that the support is multi-agency support, where all the agencies that support these schools are working together.
Sian Gwenllian AM: Well, how long does it take, therefore, for a school to move from an improvement category, in terms of special measures, to be escalated then? Because one sees sometimes that there's an excellent school, and within five years'time, it's in the red. So, there's a great deal of variance in that.
Meilyr Rowlands: Well, that would be something quite unusual--to move from excellent to red.
Sian Gwenllian AM: Yes, well, gradually, perhaps.
Meilyr Rowlands: Yes. Perhaps Claire can respond to this.
Claire Morgan: On average, secondary schools that are in need of special measures take just over two years, on average. Some are shorter; some are quite a considerable amount longer. It's a little less for schools that go into significant improvement. With primary schools, of course, it's much shorter because the issues are far less complex; it's easier to bring about improvements in teaching. When you've got large numbers of staff, you've got large secondary schools, it takes time to actually bring about those improvements, but it is a long time, just over two years, when you think that some pupils, maybe in key stage 4 for the two years--. Certainly, we want to see schools coming out of category much quicker, and this is where the multi-agency approach certainly is a positive step. All partners involved in supporting the school are involved in these improvement boards. They focus on bringing about improvement in the areas of the school that are weakest, and it is the responsibility of everybody involved--that is: ourselves, the regions, local authorities, the schools themselves and their governing bodies--to look at how they can best support the school to bring about that improvement. So, it's getting an agreement on what the issues are, and then planning the support so that we avoid duplication, but that we support the school in the areas they need more support. And we hope that this then will accelerate the improvement of the schools that find themselves in category. But, as Meilyr already said, there are some schools involved in that particular pilot that are at danger of causing serious concern. So, the pilot is trying out those two different approaches as well.
Sian Gwenllian AM: Okay, thank you. And just finally from me, for the time being at least, the financial situation; we've spoken about that already this morning. If you could--. If funding was injected into the system tomorrow, say, what would you spend it on? What aspects would benefit from that additional funding?
Meilyr Rowlands: Were you asking about something specific there?
Sian Gwenllian AM: In the schools themselves, if you were a school leader, what would you--
Meilyr Rowlands: Oh, if I were a school leader.
Sian Gwenllian AM: Yes. How would you use any additional funding that would flow into the school?
Meilyr Rowlands: It's difficult to make that decision, because every school is different. It is important, of course, that leaders do have the power and the ability to make those decisions themselves. But, certainly, in the short term, the type of thing I would have thought would be to prepare for the new curriculum. That means freeing up teachers to think about what the new curriculum means to them. The schools that have been a part of developing the curriculum have been in a fortunate position in that they've had plenty of time to think about this. So, it's now time--and this was the chief message of my annual report this year--for every school in Wales to start to think. Because I think that the new curriculum is truly an opportunity to take a forward step in terms of how we teach and learn within schools. But that means that time is needed for schools to think this through and, in that thinking, to contact the community, to talk to their children as well, to see what the community in its broader sense would like to see being in the new curriculum, because it's up to every school. Although the new curriculum sets a framework, it is up to each and every school to decide what they're going to teach, and what they're teaching in order to prepare their young people for this new world that we have in the twenty-first century. Therefore, to give you a somewhat superficial answer, I would be setting time aside for the training of teachers.
Jassa Scott: Can I just add one thing there? I think what we've seen over the years recently is that local authorities, to some extent, have safeguarded the funding that goes to the schools, but the effect of that is that we've seen less funding going into some of the local authority services; for example, those services that support well-being, that promote attendance, and that perhaps support behaviour and assistance for schools. So, I think that all of those factors contribute to how schools can support and assist their pupils, and to improve themselves. So, I think that side of things is important as well--in the school or in the local authority, if funding is available, it should be allocated to all of those things so that those services can also support the children to succeed.
Sian Gwenllian AM: Thank you.
Lynne Neagle AM: Just before we move on to the middle tier, if I can just ask about the quality of teaching? There's been a consistent message from Estyn that that is the weakest part of the system in Wales. The Government recognises that and has invested a very significant amount of money in that area, yet it's still an issue again in your annual report. You haven't said whether it's getting better or going in the right direction. What is your assessment of whether we are seeing the improvements we need to see in the quality of teaching?
Meilyr Rowlands: I think, in nearly all the elements of our framework, the picture is fairly similar. So, in terms of quality of teaching, we have seen gradual but quite small-scale improvements in primary. So, you can feel that that is going in the right direction. In secondary, it's more or less level; we haven't seen it getting particularly better or particularly worse. One of the things that's really important to realise is that the curriculum is about the quality of teaching. It is about the teaching and learning; those are two sides of the same coin, if you like. What's important is the learning experience that our pupils get in school. From the perspective of the pupil, it's the learning; from the perspective of the teacher, it's the teaching. They are two sides to the same coin. I think there's no doubt and I think there's general agreement that, in order to have a step change in the quality of teaching and learning--. I think it was Einstein who said that if you keep on doing the same thing, you'll get the same result. So, you're going to have to change something, and what's changing is the curriculum. I think there's general consensus that this is the right approach to improve the quality of teaching. And that's exactly what all schools need to do now: to think how does this new curriculum affect them in their particular school, in their particular circumstances, in the context of their particular children. How can they use this opportunity now to improve the teaching and learning in their school?
Lynne Neagle AM: Sian.
Sian Gwenllian AM: It does cause one concern, because if the teaching and learning standards just stay the same in the secondary sector, and we know that 12 per cent of secondary schools are under Estyn review and 11 per cent of them are in special measures, we're talking about half of the schools almost, and no improvement in the teaching quality in general. So, there is a major cohort of children captured in that situation, and then there's a new curriculum that comes in. I see the opportunities, but these schools that are doing well are going to go,'Wow, up there', but schools are there in the bottom layer and one is genuinely concerned about those children in those schools. Isn't that where the focus should be and any additional funding that's allocated? You talked about releasing teachers for training, but perhaps it's in those particular schools that we need to focus.
Meilyr Rowlands: I do agree that the best schools will welcome the opportunities and that their standards will improve even more. But then, with regard to the other schools, in a way, there are two very broad categories, which are those that need only a little support just to help them to improve--. And I believe that the new curriculum and the general support that's going to be surrounding that will be the solution for those schools. It's going to be an opportunity for the quality of the teaching and the learning to improve. But you're right to say that there is another smaller cohort that has a much greater need for support, and they're going to find coping with the new curriculum difficult, because they'll also have many other problems. So, I do agree--. And you're not talking about a huge number of schools--some 200 secondary schools is what we have in Wales, so that percentage is relatively small, the number is relatively small--but they need much greater support. That is why this pilot scheme of the multi-agency approach of supporting those schools is important. I do believe that you're right to say that there are funding implications to supporting those schools. I don't think it's enormous, but certainly there's a certain amount of funding that is needed to offer those schools that support.
Lynne Neagle AM: Thank you. Janet.
Janet Finch-Saunders AM: Thank you, Chair. The Minister recently told the committee that a number of recent Estyn inspections of local authorities'education services have been disappointing. Do you agree? That, of course, is based on the inspections carried out under the current cycle.
Meilyr Rowlands: Yes, indeed. I think we've done nine inspections of local authorities'education services so far this cycle. We've got another two this academic year. We'll have done half of them by the end of the academic year. We'll then evaluate how things have gone. But of those nine we've put three into category--we've identified them as causing concern--and they're Pembrokeshire, Powys and Wrexham. So, we do have concerns about those authorities. So, we'll be supporting those authorities, moving forward. But I think a common factor in those inspections was secondary schools. So, we've talking quite a bit about secondary schools this morning, and I think that, again, is a factor in those local authorities.
Janet Finch-Saunders AM: Thank you. You say that the proportion of secondary schools causing concern is a challenge for several local authorities and for the system as a whole. Which local authorities are these--you've probably named them all--and have these been inspected yet under the current cycle?
Meilyr Rowlands: I think you're taking about three secondary schools in a category in Pembrokeshire, Wrexham and Torfaen. So, we've inspected Pembrokeshire and Wrexham already, but we haven't inspected Torfaen yet. And two schools in a category in Powys, Newport and Gwynedd. And we've inspected Powys and Newport, but we haven't inspected Gwynedd yet. So, in answer to your question: we've inspected most of those, but not all of them.
Janet Finch-Saunders AM: Okay. What is your latest assessment of how well the regional consortia are supporting and driving school improvement? Does this vary across the different regions?
Meilyr Rowlands: It certainly does vary, but I'll ask Jassa to go into more detail.
Jassa Scott: We haven't directly inspected the regional consortia since--I think 2017 was the last time we did some direct monitoring with them. But I think, over the last three years, we do feel that they've improved their knowledge. They're still relatively new in the big scheme of things. So, they did take a little while to embed, and I think that came across when we did the work that we did with them back in 2017. But, more recently, they've improved their knowledge of individual schools'strengths and areas for improvement, and they are using this knowledge better to support and challenge schools, and particularly schools causing concern. But obviously, as we've been talking about this morning, there's still work to do. I think they've prioritised well the work that schools are doing around literacy and numeracy, but their support for schools to develop digital competence has been a bit weaker. Even though we've had the framework as an early part of the curriculum developments there, we haven't seen quite the focus that we've seen on other areas. I think for schools causing concern, what we found--and we do look at their work through our local authority inspection, so we are getting some first-hand evidence of their impact through that--they're not always focused, in those schools causing concern, on improving teaching and learning, so actually getting in and looking and working with teachers and with staff to actually make improvements there. I think, generally, their support for secondary schools has had less impact across the consortia than it has for primary schools, and I think sometimes that's because they're struggling to recruit appropriate specialists, to support with secondary, or perhaps they don't have the depth of strong practice that we talked about earlier within their region. So, they're having to work a bit harder to find effective practice, to share practice and to get the secondary expertise and knowledge to support those schools. We will be, over the next year, looking specifically at the work of consortia to support curriculum reform work. Well, we think we will be--we haven't had our remit letter yet. But that's one of the areas we've discussed, about doing some specific work on over the next year to look in a bit more depth.
Janet Finch-Saunders AM: So, what is the cycle of inspections for regional consortia, and how robust are those inspections? What areas do you cover?
Jassa Scott: Well, regional consortia aren't actually statutory entities at the moment, and we don't have specific inspection powers relating to regional consortia. What we have are powers to inspect school improvement. So, on each of our local authority inspections, there will be, usually, an area that we're looking at that relates to school improvement, and that would involve us looking at the work of the consortia that the local authority has commissioned. What we've agreed with Welsh Government is that, over the next few years, we will take a thematic approach. So, the first area that we've said is that we'll look specifically at how each of them is supporting curriculum reform, and report on that. So, that will report specifically on the different ones, but it wouldn't be the same as doing an inspection of their work at this time.
Janet Finch-Saunders AM: Should they be on a statutory footing?
Jassa Scott: Well, I think that's something to be discussed over the next few years. There's, obviously, local government legislation that has been debated recently, which has the potential to create corporate joint committees, and school improvement was one of the areas that is being considered there. So, there may be an opportunity, if that's created, to think how we then adapt inspection to look specifically at that. So, I think there is an opportunity. I think we do get a handle on their work through the local authority and, ultimately, it's looking at what that consortia brings to that local authority and to the schools and the pupils in that area that's the important bit, I think, ultimately, to see the impact there. So, we are looking at them in that way, and then taking that thematic approach, but we'll keep reviewing it over the next couple of years.
Janet Finch-Saunders AM: Thank you. And what are Estyn's views on the latest position regarding regional working in south-west and mid Wales? Would it be preferable for school improvement advisers to be based in the consortium, Education through Regional Work, rather than each local authority employing their own, as is the case at present?
Meilyr Rowlands: If I can just go back to the last question as well, what we did in order to inspect regions was we paused our local authority inspection cycle back in 2014, I think, for about three years. So, then, we spent time looking at regions, basically, because we didn't have the resource to do both at the same time. So, we're in negotiation with Welsh Government currently, so that, going forward, we can look at local authorities and regions at the same time. If regions become statutory entities, that would be in legislation, and then you could have legislation that gives us directly the powers to inspect them, which we don't currently have. So, we have to, effectively, wait for Welsh Government to ask us to do that work. But, as Jassa said, currently, what we intend to do in the short is to do some thematic work on that. In terms of ERW, they were the region that, at the end of the last cycle of regional inspections, we were still monitoring. We are concerned about their progress, particularly in the light of recent developments. So, for example, the chair of the joint committee has resigned, the managing director remains a temporary appointment and there are no clear plans for a permanent leadership. Some of the leadership team have left--the capacity has gone down--and various staff that were appointed last summer have already left. The budget has not been agreed and certain key meetings--executive board and joint committee meetings--have been cancelled. So, we are particularly worried about ERW, and, because of that, we will be going in to visit them in April--next month--and we'll be visiting all of the authorities to make sure that they do have a plan for an appropriate school improvement service going forward. But, Jassa, probably, can say a little bit more about our plans there.
Jassa Scott: Yes, I think you asked a specific question about, you know, which is better. I think our view has been that, generally, the local authorities are too small to deliver that whole range of school improvement services, particularly given the national reform agenda at the moment. We felt last summer, when we went to ERW, that they'd managed to reach the best possible model, given the constraint they've placed, collectively, on themselves--that they want to deliver aspects of school improvement locally, through the local authorities, and have some central capacity. So, we felt that, given that they wanted to do some locally and some centrally, enough thought had been put into that structure last summer and that it could be workable. There were key aspects such as support for secondary schools causing concern and there was some capacity centrally that could support areas such as Powys. Unfortunately, as Meilyr has described, some of those aspects have since been disbanded or those staff who were on secondment have gone back, so I think it is a key risk, particularly for some of those authorities you've talked about that are causing concern, such as Powys or Pembrokeshire--that they haven't necessarily got that local capacity to support their schools causing concern. So, you've got some concerns within school capacity and you've got concerns about local authority capacity, and what you don't have there now is that collective capacity centrally that might support them. So, that's why we're going to go and do a slightly more detailed link visit to try to understand how they are mitigating the risks that we see are arising as a result of some of those things that have happened recently. Our understanding is that there's a joint committee meeting of ERW on 19 March, so, hopefully, after that point, we'll have a little bit more information about how they're planning to manage that collective set of services going forward--it's a little bit of an unknown at the moment.
Meilyr Rowlands: You were asking,'Would it be better for every authority to have their own team?'But, before regions were invented, if you like, we were saying consistently that they tended to be too small. What happened in practice was that authorities did come together voluntarily to have joint advisory services. So, you had Cynnal in the north west, you had the Education and School Improvement Service, you had Gwent--so, they naturally did come together in groups, maybe a little bit smaller than the current regions, but they, of their own accord, produced something not very dissimilar to a region.
Lynne Neagle AM: Sian, did you have a supplementary?
Sian Gwenllian AM: Yes, just on ERW. Does the fact that there is a dispute on the highest level feed down to the school and to the children? Are the children in south-west and mid Wales affected by this? Are standards decreasing in that part of Wales?
Meilyr Rowlands: Well, it's difficult to say directly, but we have inspected nine authorities and two of those are in that area, so, the lack of support at that level, as Jassa was saying, may be the reason why those authorities are suffering difficulties.
Jassa Scott: And it is clear that many people across that area are expending energy and time discussing these issues. Any reorganisation does take energy out of the system, so it is clear that that time isn't then being spent, perhaps, on investment in improving schools and supporting staff in schools. So, as Meilyr says, it's not clear, but a lot of energy is being expended in that particular discussion that is ongoing.
Lynne Neagle AM: Janet.
Janet Finch-Saunders AM: What disadvantages could there be from Neath Port Talbot's intention to withdraw from regional working via ERW? And I've got to be honest, up in the north, I know that there are concerns about regional consortia, and when local authorities are under pressure financially, it questions, sometimes, the value of regional consortia. So, what disadvantages could there be from Neath Port Talbot's intention to withdraw from regional working via ERW?
Meilyr Rowlands: I think we've talked in general terms and we feel that local authorities probably are too small on their own. In general terms, you can't say that any particular authority couldn't, maybe, put things together in such a way that it's effective. Also, it has a knock-on effect on the rest of the consortium, if one withdraws. I don't know whether, Jassa, you've got anything to add to the general points we've made.
Jassa Scott: I mean, I think, what you've alluded to there, it has the potential to be a destabilising factor across the whole of the national model that we've got for supporting school improvement at a time where Welsh Government are kind of relying heavily on that consortium model to help support curriculum reform and to drive professional learning and be the conduit for lots of the aspects of reform that we've talked about. So, I think that potential risk of any destabilising across the system is a disadvantage generally. I think--. Clearly, we've talked about that capacity at a local level. There is that aspect of what that means in terms of the joint capacity across the other authorities there. And I think it's just what I've already talked about in terms of being a distraction at a crucial time for support where schools need to feel that they're confident in where they need to go for support. I should say that we're planning, as part of that visit that we do in April, to survey schools in that region about the support that they're getting, be that from their authority or from the central teams in ERW. That's something we did at the time when we did the inspections previously, and we thought it would be helpful to get some first-hand views of any disadvantages or impact that they might be feeling, really.
Suzy Davies AM: Okay, thank you. And then, finally, for me: what involvement has Estyn had with the strategic education delivery group chaired by Professor Dylan Jones and what are your expectations for how it will improve the work of the middle tier?
Meilyr Rowlands: We've been members of that group right from the beginning. I personally am on it and colleagues are on it as well, and I'm a member of the sub-group that does some of the background work for that group as well, and Estyn has given several presentations to that group. I think the group is important. I remember commenting the first time it met that it was welcoming. The rather obvious thing is that you get all the strategic educational organisations together in one room, but it had never been done before, as far as I know. So, it was a really important step forward for that to happen. I'm a very firm believer in making those relationships, building those relationships, so that people understand what each of us contributes to the whole of the education system. We need to have that forum to be able to make sure that we're clear about what each of our roles is.
Janet Finch-Saunders AM: Okay, thanks.
Lynne Neagle AM: Okay, thank you. We've got some questions now from Dawn Bowden.
Dawn Bowden AM: Thank you, Chair. Morning, all. In your report you talked about in early settings where skills development is less effective, that children begin to feel at a very early age that they can't do certain things. I don't know whether that is anecdotal evidence or is that specific outcome-based evidence--whatever, it's quite worrying. But what do you think the long-term effect on a child's development has in that respect?
Claire Morgan: It's probably worth saying that skill development is a strength in about three quarters of our schools--primary schools and early years settings. But in a minority of schools and settings, as you've picked up, children are often introduced to things too early. So, they're introduced to phonics, they're introduced to learning to read, when they're not at that developmental stage. And really, long term, it means the children lose confidence, because if they're introduced to these things too early they don't succeed, they tend to need additional support, and it can give them a negative impression, it can give them negative thoughts about their ability. So, we need to address that, and really it's about--
Dawn Bowden AM: Sorry, what sort of age range are we talking about here?
Claire Morgan: These would be children from three to five.
Dawn Bowden AM: Okay.
Claire Morgan: So, this is very, very early on.
Dawn Bowden AM: And is there something, then, in that--and I don't think there's much we can do about that, but it may be in terms of the way that the schools or the early learning settings address this--you will have children at a very young age that have almost a year's difference in their age group, so they're born just before 1 September or just after 1 September? So, that's a huge gap, isn't it, at that point in their development?
Claire Morgan: Yes.
Dawn Bowden AM: Is that not being addressed in a way that those children are being taught and approached at that age?
Claire Morgan: Yes.
Dawn Bowden AM: Right, okay. That's fine. In terms of reading and literacy skills, we still remain quite low in the Programme for International Student Assessment ratings for reading, and I know there is a particular concern about the impact on boys in that regard. What do you think are the most pressing priorities that face them around reading and literacy?
Meilyr Rowlands: I think literacy has been, and still is, and still needs to be a top priority. I mean, literacy clearly is something that underpins the rest of education, so it really does need to be a top priority. I think it has been a high priority, but we need to continue prioritising it. We've seen some improvements over the years. For example, we've given a lot of attention to writing over the years, and making sure that children get the opportunity to write in an extended way, not just short sentences, but having the opportunity to have extended writing, and there's some evidence that that now is beginning to have an effect. But almost ironically, the same sort of issue is true of reading. So, it's not just reading small little snippets--we need to encourage children to have a love for reading and read whole books. So, I gave a little bit of attention to that in the annual report--that that needs attention. I think the other thing I would emphasise is that this is not just for the foundation phase, it's not just for very young children--it's really important at key stage 2 and in secondary school. One of the things we have been worried about, and I think there was some reflection of this in PISA, is that there are strengths in reading in Wales. So, PISA, for example, said that children in Wales are very good at comparing lots of little snippets, but what they're saying, and they're saying this themselves, is that the love of books is decreasing, and the number of children who read regularly whole books. So, I think there is something there for teachers to set and model a good example, to show their own interest in reading, to encourage children to read themselves.
Dawn Bowden AM: It's probably a wider societal problem as well, isn't it? I'm thinking about gaming, electronic gaming, computers.
Meilyr Rowlands: Absolutely. I think there is some sort of link with the digital world, and the way people read--the actual technique of reading, is evolving. But I think reading is so important, and developing a complex vocabulary is so important in being able to communicate, in order to get a good job, to have enjoyment out of life--all of those things are so important. We ourselves are going to give this quite a lot of priority in future, so we're doing a major piece of work on language acquisition, which will cover some of this next year. Every year one of our thematics is the major bit of work we do, and we try to support that with a conference. So, that will be the focus that we give to our work next year--it is on language acquisition.
Dawn Bowden AM: Okay, thank you for that. Just one other supplementary on that, I guess, is whether you have a good idea of how many young people are coming out of school at 16--so, those that are not staying on to do A-levels--and are coming out with an inability to read or white. Do we know what the figure is for that?
Meilyr Rowlands: I can't tell you that off the top of my head, but I'm sure that there will be evidence. That's not something we inspect as such.
Dawn Bowden AM: No, no, but there should be evidence around that. Okay.
Jassa Scott: There has been a shift in that there's been continued emphasis in post-16 education and training around literacy and picking that up. For example, anyone who's studying in a further education college will have to do resits. There's an aim to try and get everyone to a basic level. In apprenticeships they'll use essential skills and so on to try and get that basic level of literacy as well, so there is an emphasis. I think one of the worrying indications, maybe, that post-16 sectors find is that sometimes even when learners are coming out with a basic qualification in a GCSE, potentially in English or a literature subject, they don't necessarily have a really good foundation of some of the basic skills as well. So, there is a lot of work to do in this area.
Dawn Bowden AM: Okay, all right. Could I just move you on--? Sorry--
Meilyr Rowlands: The only thing I would add to that is, I guess, it's quite small, the number of people who don't have basic reading. I think one of the things we need to emphasise is that learning reading is something you do throughout your life, and what we need to do is to develop, in particular, pupils'higher level reading skills. The fact that they can just read isn't the end of the story; they need to be developing those higher level reading skills and continuing to widen the range of things they read, and be able to develop their vocabulary at a higher level.
Dawn Bowden AM: And their comprehension, I guess.
Meilyr Rowlands: Sorry?
Dawn Bowden AM: And their comprehension as well.
Meilyr Rowlands: Absolutely, yes--those higher level skills of comprehension and inference and those sorts of things.
Dawn Bowden AM: Sure, okay. Can I just move you on, then, to numeracy and whether you can tell us if you're satisfied with the progress in numeracy, because I think we were doing better on the PISA results in maths in Wales than we did previously? So, what are your thoughts on that?
Meilyr Rowlands: I think there is a fairly clear good news story here. PISA shows improvements and a lot of that can be attributed, I think, to the new GCSE mathematics numeracy. I think there's much less predictability in that work; you can't approach it in a formulaic way, either the pupils or the teachers in terms of teaching it. There's much more problem solving. It's about applying what you've learnt in the core mathematics lessons to new situations in subjects across the curriculum. I think that that GCSE numeracy has built on the work that's been done lower down on the national numeracy framework, which has the same philosophy of applying that mathematics knowledge in a problem-solving situation. That has been a really good news story, really.
Dawn Bowden AM: That's something to be positive about, anyway. That's good. My final question, Chair, is: in your view, to what extent is Wales on track to meet the target of 500 points in each of the domains in the 2020-1 cycle for PISA?
Meilyr Rowlands: I think that that target is somewhat arbitrary, but assuming that we continue on this journey that we are on--the current change programme of the new curriculum and so forth--I think we would expect to see those improvements we've seen in science and in mathematics to continue. We've talked about reading and I think we will be giving more attention to reading. I think the education system more generally, hopefully, will give more attention to reading. So, I would hope to see improvements there as well. The only other thing I would add is that there is some research that indicates or suggests that the effect of schools is greater on mathematics and science than on reading, and the reason for that is you don't do a lot mathematics or science in the home. But the attitude towards reading is very much dependent on family and community factors, more so, maybe, than mathematics and science. So, I think that's another reason why I think a community-school approach is really important. You need to get everybody on board; it's not just what the teacher does in the classroom--it's important that the whole family and the community thinks that reading is important.
Dawn Bowden AM: Just on numeracy, it was interesting because one of the schools in my constituency have actually contacted my office and a number of other organisations across the constituency to ask us how we use maths in our work. So, they're obviously trying to relate that now to everyday life and working, which I thought was quite good.
Meilyr Rowlands: That's good.
Lynne Neagle AM: We've got some questions now around progress of specific groups of pupils. If I can start and ask you how concerning is it that the gap between pupils eligible for free school meals and other pupils has not narrowed in the last 10 years, especially given the PS475 million pupil deprivation grant investment.
Meilyr Rowlands: Yes. I think secondary schools and the issue of poverty were the two things I've noted in the annual report. So, I think it is a concern to us. I think it is worth also remembering that compared to other countries, for example, in PISA, we do compare quite well in terms of equity. There's also an argument that maybe poverty and austerity have increased, so that we're in a way running to keep still. And I think also, as I was suggesting about the reading, poverty really is a social phenomenon. Schools can't solve that on their own. So, there are a lot of caveats to be made around the fact that that poverty gap hasn't closed, but that's not to say that schools can't do something about it, and I've suggested in the annual report a sort of a two-pronged approach. One is the new curriculum. I think there is evidence in the international research that teaching and learning, better teaching and learning, helps disadvantaged poor pupils disproportionately. So, they gain more from it that their peers. So, I think improving teaching and learning, and we discussed that earlier this morning about how the new curriculum is really all about improving the quality of teaching and learning in the classroom. So, that's one approach, and then the other approach, which I've also mentioned earlier, is having a community-focused approach to schools. The schools that do more successfully tackle the poverty gap are the schools that take that kind of approach. It means helping the pupils. It means helping their families. It's about making pupil well-being really high on the agenda. It's very difficult for children to do well in school if they've got all kinds of things happening in their background. So, it's important that schools can maybe signpost those families to other services that can support them and help them. So, it's quite a complex--. It's challenging for schools to go down this route, and I think the more help we can give schools to take that approach, the better. But the schools that do do it do benefit a lot from it. They have better engagement from parents, from the families, and that then reflects back on the work of the children.
Jassa Scott: And we've just published a collection of good practice about how schools support vulnerable learners, and we'll be teasing out the aspects around community-focused schools a lot more in a report that we'll publish in the next couple of months. So, we've kind of drilled down and looked at what some schools are doing in that area in a bit more detail.
Lynne Neagle AM: Thank you. Suzy, on this.
Suzy Davies AM: Yes, just quickly. Obviously, I think we've all been to schools where the PDG is actually used to engage parents more for exactly the reasons you say. But I just wanted to interrogate the deprivation gap a little bit, because, of course, even though, as you say, there's perhaps more equity in Wales, one of the reasons for that is because our children from better-off backgrounds do less well, and considerably less well than their peers in the other parts of the United Kingdom. So, whereas their attainment gaps are pretty dreadful, that's one of the reasons--that our better-off children aren't doing as well as perhaps they might do. Is that a concern as well? We don't want this rush to the middle, do we?
Meilyr Rowlands: I think it's essential that all groups of pupils do as well as they possibly can, absolutely. So, it's not quite the same issue, but we've talked about the importance of making sure that more able and talented children do well.
Suzy Davies AM: They're not the same.
Meilyr Rowlands: They're not the same, clearly, because you have more able and talented children from poor backgrounds. Differentiation is a challenge for schools, but it's absolutely essential that all groups of children do as well as they possibly can. So, in things like PISA, in terms of reading, for example, we can't just say it's that group that needs to improve--all the groups need to improve. And I think that's why something like the new curriculum gives schools more scope to tailor their teaching and learning to the particular groups that they have, whether they're more able, whether they're advantaged or whether they're disadvantaged.
Suzy Davies AM: Okay, thanks. Thank you, Lynne.
Lynne Neagle AM: Okay. Pupils'confidence in their school's ability to help them with their emotional and mental well-being is much less at secondary school and that's been a consistent theme as well from your reports. Why do you think that is?
Jassa Scott: Yes, you're right. As we mentioned earlier, we do pupil surveys before all our inspections, and across a number of those indicators, like,'How well does the school listen? Do adults in school care about me? How well does the school deal with bullying?'--quite a lot those ones around well-being do tail off. Nine out of 10 pupils at key stage 2 have that confidence, down to half at key stage 4, as you say. And I think there are a number of factors that we think contribute to that: I think one of the factors is that pupils face, sometimes, more challenges as they get older in those teenage years, but they also become more reflective and perhaps more discerning. And I think what we find in secondary schools is perhaps secondary school pupils notice sometimes the differences between their everyday life that they experience in school and perhaps the messages that they're getting about well-being in terms of their lessons, in terms of assemblies and in terms of school policies and so on. So, they are probably more discerning in noticing those differences and maybe there are some of those differences also there in primary school, but the pupils don't notice. I think we've already touched upon things like the differences in the way that, at primary school, you would tend to have a go-to adult, which is your teacher. The best secondary schools find ways to make sure that pupils do feel that level of support and feel there are trusted people, but it's more of a challenge to make sure that that happens, because of the way they're operating. We still have some concerns about personal and social education and the health and well-being support, which we've made a recommendation about in the past in some of our thematic reports, but also recently in some of our secondary school inspection reports. And I think I already touched upon the fact that sometimes, when the budget is tight, it can be some of those--they're not peripheral in their importance, but they're not the teacher in the classroom: well-being support assistants and so on and family liaison workers--staff in the school who perhaps really support that pastoral care that the school as a whole can provide--it may be that those are the roles that are less prevalent at times of less funding. So, I think there are some great members of staff doing a really good job, but perhaps they're not those members of staff who can support teachers and support pupils in creating that kind of caring environment. Maybe there a fewer of them around. So, I think there's not an obvious answer and part of it is that they do become more discerning and perhaps more vocal in those responses generally, as they get older. So, you might have a truer reflection of opinions than perhaps--. And that might explain some of the difference with primary, where, generally, they're quite positive about everything across most of the schools that we ask.
Lynne Neagle AM: So, it's not that secondary schools--because you've said that in a previous inspection report--are just not as good at prioritising mental health and well-being.
Jassa Scott: I think there's an element that it's more of a challenge for a secondary school to provide an effective set of support from that whole-staff awareness of some of the challenges. And one of the pieces of work we've done recently is around adverse childhood experiences, and we have found that primary schools have taken that and embraced it. Once you've trained your staff, then they've got that knowledge. They're the ones who are working day to day with the schools. Secondary schools haven't always taken a whole-school approach to that. They might have trained a set of staff. So, maybe not every member of staff has the same level of understanding, but also those staff aren't spending the same amount of time with pupils. So, in terms of getting to know pupils, picking up on signs that they may be struggling, or that there might be concerns--it's much more of a challenge. You've got to work a lot harder as a secondary school to make sure that staff have that knowledge and that you've got the tracking systems that can put those different bits of information together to actually mean that you can target support where it's needed.
Lynne Neagle AM: Thank you. Suzy.
Suzy Davies AM: I'm just thinking again about specific groups of pupils. Obviously, we've had one case in north Wales, in an independent school, where there were serious concerns. What's that done to your desire to monitor and check what's going on in these independent schools? Are they regulated sufficiently?
Jassa Scott: I'll pick up on that as well. Just to explain how we work with independent schools, initially, to give the context. So, there are different kinds of independent schools. So, some have boarding provision, and where they have boarding provision, Care Inspectorate Wales would look at the boarding side of it, we'd look at the educational side of it. There are others where they may have a linked children's home, which can be another room in the same house, or it can be a number of miles away, and similarly there CIW would look at the residential aspects of the care and we'd look at the school. So, I think, there's a focus in the independent school standards regulations, which is a minimum that all schools have to meet to maintain a registration. There is a focus in that on how that school looks after and cares for its pupils, and there are focuses on that element of boarding provision where relevant, and the national minimum standards that the care inspectorate look at that have aspects around supporting well-being as well. What we do find in our inspections is that, overall, we generally find that pupils'well-being develops, they make good progress, and that care, support and guidance that schools give is good. What we mean by that, really, practically, is that they are developing their resilience and their self-esteem. In special schools, this might mean particularly that those pupils learn to manage their anxieties better so that they improve their behaviour, which may be one of the reasons why they're in that specialist setting. In mainstream independent schools, what we find is that people develop their tenacity, their curiosity for learning--their resilience in that way. But there are shortcomings sometimes. For example, there was one school where we found that they weren't making appropriate referrals to child and adolescent mental health services. So, these schools do operate independently by their nature, and their awareness, perhaps, of some of the guidance and support that is out there--sometimes, maybe, there can be more to be done, and I think we've talked to Welsh Government about that.
Suzy Davies AM: What's Estyn's role in that--to bring that level of awareness to those schools?
Jassa Scott: I think we do through our inspection guidance, and the independent school standards do refer to Welsh Government guidance--it's something like'Keeping learners safe', which is a really key document, which supports safeguarding and caring across schools. That's regularly discussed and talked about and referred to with those schools. So, I think the other area is that sometimes we don't have the intelligence about what--. So, for example, if there's been a safeguarding referral from a school, we don't necessarily always get that information, which means that when we do go to inspect, we may not have the full picture to help us tailor our inspection activity. So, that's something we've raised--
Lynne Neagle AM: [Inaudible. ]--be brief and brief in answers.
Suzy Davies AM: Al right, okay. Do you mind if I move on to the next question?
Lynne Neagle AM: We're going to have to skip those, I'm afraid, and talk to the last set of questions, just because of the time pressures. Hefin.
Hefin David AM: I'd like to ask in Welsh, please. What role, if any, did Estyn have in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development's latest review of progress in school improvement when they visited Wales in late 2019?
Meilyr Rowlands: Well, we were interviewed. Therefore, the three of us had an interview with the OECD officials and we offered evidence to them. And I think that, when the report is published, you will see that the OECD does draw on our broader evidence and will be quoting our reports--the annual report and some of our thematic reports. That is the part that we played in that work.
Hefin David AM: Thanks. How significant a role do you believe the national evaluation and improvement resource will play in raising school standards?
Meilyr Rowlands: I think that it's very important. It's Claire who has been specifically tasked with that, so I'll ask Claire to speak about it.
Claire Morgan: I think working together with the practitioners, the regions and representatives from local authorities is a great opportunity to develop a national approach, because we know across Wales there's some excellent practice, but we know there are schools that struggle to bring about improvement. So, this national resource has the potential to provide schools with detailed guidance on how they can approach not only self-evaluation, but, more importantly, how they can bring about that improvement. So, it will be a resource that develops over time. It's starting--we're piloting currently with around 40 schools. Half of those have been involved in developing the tools and approaches right from the start, and 22 new schools have come on board this year. But we anticipate that there will be lots of tools and approaches within that resource that schools can use to improve the quality of self-evaluation throughout the school, primaries, secondaries, PRUs and special schools. But it will focus on establishing a culture within the school that focuses on improvement, that establishes a reflective culture where all staff are involved in development. So, we're hoping that this tool--it's still currently in development, but we hope that that will support schools really well.
Hefin David AM: So, it's an evolving piece of work.
Claire Morgan: Yes, it is.
Hefin David AM: Okay. And, with regard to comparison of performance, does the lack of comparative attainment data raise difficulties when you're inspecting and drawing conclusions and standards in schools?
Meilyr Rowlands: Not really, no. I think there was a bit of a myth that a lot of this performance data was just for Estyn, but actually it never has been. When we inspect, we look at a whole range of aspects of the work. We look at standards, we look at teaching and learning in the classroom, we look at well-being, we look at care support and guidance, we look at leadership, we look at all of these things, and we look at it based on first-hand evidence--what we actually see in the classroom. So, we're quite happy to continue to inspect schools, and we in fact support having less emphasis on data because, although data is useful, and we hope that schools will continue to analyse their data and use that data to help them self-improve and self-evaluate, we don't actually need it and it has actually created a bit of a high-stakes culture. So, I think stepping back from that culture is a good idea.
Lynne Neagle AM: Okay, thank you very much. We've come to the end of our time, so can I thank you all for your attendance? As usual, you'll receive a transcript to check for accuracy following the meeting. But thank you very much again for coming in this morning.
Meilyr Rowlands: Diolch yn fawr--thank you.
Lynne Neagle AM: Item 3, then, is papers to note. Paper to note 1 is a ministerial update on the emotional and mental health of children and young people in Wales--next steps for'Mind over matter'. Paper to note 2 is a letter from the Minister for Housing and Local Government regarding teachers'pay and pensions, and paper to note 3 is a letter to the Minister for Education from us regarding the school funding review. Are Members happy to note those? Thank you. Can I then propose under Standing Order 17. 42 that the committee resolves to meet in private for the remainder of the meeting? Are Members content? Great. Okay. Thank you.","Meilyr Rowlands thought it was a fairly clear good news to see the improvements on the PISA results in maths, which could be attributed to the new GCSE mathematics numeracy. Also they agreed it was a good news story to see much more mathematics knowledge to be applied in a problem-solving situation. With regard to the effects of schools, Meilyr Rowlands held that the school had a larger effect on mathematics and science than reading.",qmsum
"What was the appearance of the prototype as shared in the presentation?
Marketing: It's Play-Doh.
Project Manager: Play-Doh's edible. Did you know that? It's definitely {disfmarker}
Marketing: Because kids {disfmarker} yeah.
Industrial Designer: I used to eat it.
User Interface: I've, I've definitely eaten it before. I didn't know was edible. {vocalsound} {gap}.
Project Manager: Yeah. It's it's chew proof. {vocalsound}
Marketing: But um, it's it's made edible'cause, yeah. It's made edible'cause kids eat it,
Project Manager: Yeah.
Marketing: and if it's wasn't edible then {disfmarker} Well, normal babies. {vocalsound}
User Interface: Actually that makes sense, because I remember like, peopl I dunno if my Mom ever did it but I remember other people's Moms making like home-made Play-Doh where you just like make the {gap} colouring and make some sort of sort of dough.
Project Manager: Yeah.
Marketing: Oh yeah it is, yeah. Oh yeah.
Project Manager: {vocalsound} Right.
User Interface: Mm-hmm.
Project Manager: Everybody everybody ready?
Industrial Designer: Yep.
User Interface: Yeah.
Project Manager: Okay, let's have your um {disfmarker} let's get {gap} have the uh presentation?
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
User Interface: We've got some {gap}.
Industrial Designer: We've got a cool prototype.
User Interface: Yeah, it's pretty exciting. So, everything uh that we wanted we wanted it to be ergonomic and to be made out of rubber, very simple and easy to use,
Industrial Designer: Double curved.
Project Manager: Nice.
User Interface: yeah, double curved,
Marketing: {vocalsound}
User Interface: um but also something that was gonna jump out at people, something that would be different uh, separate it from the other remotes out on the market. So uh I think if you put this in the palm of your hand, you'll see what a nice thing we have going here.
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
Marketing: That is cool.
User Interface: So, basically, if you hold it like that, the one on your thumb, yeah, {vocalsound} the thumb button is the power button.
Project Manager: Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.
User Interface: Your index finger is channel up, middle finger is channel down, ring finger is volume up, your pinkie is volume down.
Marketing: What's the big blue thing?
User Interface: That's the lock button, has a L_ L_ on it
Marketing: Oh cool.
User Interface: and then the M_ is a mute button. And then it also has digit
Project Manager: {gap} what button? Um. Oh mute.
User Interface: For muting the uh {disfmarker}
Marketing: And mute.
User Interface: Um and then then you can also {disfmarker} there's a numeric keypad on the top so you can key directly to the to the channel if you want.
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Okay.
User Interface: So it's really basic functionalities as far as what keys are available, but we think it's very comfortable and very innovative and it looks different.
Project Manager: That certainly does.
Marketing: {vocalsound}
User Interface: So all the, I mean the important keys are right at your f f you know right at uh at a convenient place for you to to access them.
Project Manager: Mm.
Industrial Designer: Which is ant anti-R_S_I_.
User Interface: So you don't you {disfmarker} Yeah. It should be.
Project Manager: Mm.
User Interface: And it's also conformable to the size of your hand. I mean if that's too big, it's a rubber remote, so you can, you know
Project Manager: Yeah.'S great.
User Interface: change that. So d does that uh what {disfmarker} mesh with what you guys were hoping and for and expecting or does it {disfmarker}
Marketing: Oh it's so cute.
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: I have one thing about it, but it's a small thing, but it'd mean we'd have to make a right-handed one and a left-handed one.
Industrial Designer: Oh right, yeah.
User Interface: Ah, that's good thinking, yeah.
Project Manager: But, that's I don't see why that's not possible.
User Interface: Yeah, if we build rocket ships why can't we build left-handed and right-handed uh remotes.
Project Manager: Yeah. {gap} They make left-handed scissors, you know. {vocalsound}
User Interface: {vocalsound} Yeah, I didn't I didn't think about that, but I'd {disfmarker} yeah, {gap}.
Marketing: Yeah, but then but then you can learn to use your right h like I was just thinking if there's left-handers and right-handers in the family, what, they have two remotes?
Project Manager: Yes s
Industrial Designer: Yeah, I know I know people who have left-handed and right-handed people in the family and they all use the computer {vocalsound} for the whole {disfmarker} the same computer the fes family and they have a mouse, and everybody is using right-handed mouse.
Project Manager: Mm. Sure. Sure.
Marketing: Yeah, I'm sure they'll be able to {disfmarker}
User Interface: Uh-huh.
Marketing: I mean it's only pressing buttons, you don't have to do anything, you know, extraordinary. I think everybody can press a button with their left and right hand so {disfmarker}
User Interface: Yeah.
Industrial Designer: Imagine d are you right handed?
Project Manager: Yeah.
Industrial Designer: Imagine you're doing it with your left hand, I don't think it's too {disfmarker}
Marketing: Yeah, it's not {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: But we can have both uh {disfmarker}
Marketing: Yeah. Have them in stock.
Project Manager: Yeah.
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
Marketing: Make'em more appealing as well.
Project Manager: But um other than that, I mean uh and that's um, you know, that's just something, I think I think it's great, yeah, great idea.
User Interface: Do you think it says {vocalsound} R_R_?
Industrial Designer: {gap} I think it does. {vocalsound}
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: I think it's, well, if the R_R_ motto is, we bring fashion to to electronics, I'd say that could be quite fashionable.
User Interface: Fashion to electronics. Yeah.
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
User Interface: Yeah. And it's got the b the black and yellow and blue.
Project Manager: {vocalsound} Yeah.
User Interface: Plus red, which is sort of a a fruit and vegetable uh uh.
Project Manager: {vocalsound} Yeah.
Marketing: {gap}. {vocalsound} {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} There you go.
User Interface: So that's that's {vocalsound} our end of things wha uh {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Yeah, very good, yeah.
User Interface: That's {disfmarker}
Project Manager: It's come up with what we've you know, the things that's what we've {disfmarker} what we were looking at doing, hasn't it, {gap} all seems to be there.
User Interface: Yeah.
Project Manager: Well done.
Marketing: And all the playing around is uh {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Um before we move on {disfmarker}
Marketing: Yeah, I'm just {disfmarker} do you wanna plug in?
Project Manager: I need that cable.
Marketing: Okay.
Project Manager: Thank you. Yeah. Um. One thing I do need to do {disfmarker} we need to look at, is the costs.
User Interface: The costs, was that what you said?
Industrial Designer: Play-Doh is very cheap. {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Well, yeah. {vocalsound}
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Marketing: Mm.
Project Manager: {gap} um {disfmarker}
Marketing: Play-Doh won't last very long everybody'll go like, oops, it's gone. {vocalsound} {vocalsound}
User Interface: But it's edible.
Marketing: Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.
Industrial Designer: Chew proof.
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Marketing: Well, they'll buy more of them if you eat them, {gap}.
User Interface: That was the main criteria from the last meeting, it had to be chew proof.
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Yeah. Uh right. {vocalsound} Okay, now I think we'll do this {disfmarker} I could do {disfmarker} you know, I can do this o on my own or I could do it with you,
Marketing: Yeah.
Industrial Designer: Oh ho-ho.
Project Manager: but it's just easy enough to go through it with you, so we're going for the kinetic power.
Industrial Designer: Yep.
Project Manager: {vocalsound} And the electronics, we decided on it being just a simple, the easiest thing that's inside it. Ooh.
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: So {disfmarker} the case, we've gone for the double curved. Um and it's made out of rubber. {vocalsound} The interface is push-buttons. And button supplements well they're in diff special colours, aren't they?
Marketing: Yeah.
Project Manager: So {gap} special colours.
User Interface: Yeah.
Marketing: It's better for {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Special form, yeah, they're a special form there in shapes and stuff.
User Interface: Yeah, I mean, {vocalsound} these these ones on the side are curved kind of, so {disfmarker}
Marketing: And special material.
Project Manager: Yep. Yeah. Um. Are they made out of any special material?
Industrial Designer: Rubber.
Project Manager: No they're not. They're not made out of wood or titanium or rubber or anything, they're just simple {disfmarker}
User Interface: The buttons are rubber.
Marketing: Well they're rubber, aren't they?
Project Manager: Okay. Right.
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
Project Manager: So let's see if that comes within budget. And it does. That is gonna cost uh {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: {gap}.
Marketing: We're under budget.
Project Manager: Yeah. That's gonna cost ten ten Euro seventy cents a unit to make. And our target was it had to come in at under twelve fifty.
User Interface: That's cool. Yeah. Yeah.
Project Manager: So,
User Interface: And we're actua actually making a better profit than we expected.
Project Manager: this is all very very good. The bosses will be very pleased.
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Okay, let's just save this so I can e-mail it to you. Uh.
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: {vocalsound} Save it in {gap} save it in the uh {vocalsound} my documents.
Marketing: It's already saved, I think.
Project Manager: Splendid. Okay. So uh, that's {gap} done with this with this um doodah, so you're {gap}. Gonna do {disfmarker} what you were gonna do,
Marketing: Thank you. Mm.
Project Manager: your evaluation.
Marketing: Oh, yeah. This is where we all get to {vocalsound} I get to write on the, oops, on the board. Right.
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
Marketing: Oh.'S function {disfmarker}
Project Manager: F_ eight.
Marketing: Okay.
Project Manager: {gap} I love the smell of that Play-Doh.
User Interface: {vocalsound} Yeah,
Project Manager: {vocalsound} I cou {gap}. {vocalsound}
Marketing: Mm.
User Interface: have some have some.
Marketing: Okay. So, {vocalsound} evaluation. We're gonna do it all together so we evaluate each criteria. I've got the criterias. And we have to do it on a scale of one to seven, one being true, so it's it's more like it's {disfmarker} fits the criteria, and seven being as in it doesn't fit the criteria. And the criterias are, and I'll draw this up on the board {disfmarker} {vocalsound} so we have a box {disfmarker} {gap}. And this is false, this is just like to keep you informed. So seven's here and one's here and then you've got in the middle. {vocalsound} So the first criteria. Do you all get what we're doing?
Industrial Designer: Mm-hmm.
User Interface: Mm-hmm.
Marketing: Okay, cool. Okay, first criteria, look and feel. So the does remote look and feel fashionable to what we talked about? As it {disfmarker} is it colour-wise and is it spongy?
User Interface: Mm.
Marketing: So what mark should we give for that?
Project Manager: I would give it a seven.
User Interface: Yeah.
Marketing: As in it's not.
Project Manager: Oh sorry, one, d yeah.
User Interface: Oh, sorry, one. {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: A one.
Marketing: A one a one. So I'll just write criteria criteria one we get one. Second criteria, new technology. Have we implemented new technology? As in the new high-tech {vocalsound} {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Well, the kinetic thing, yeah.
Project Manager: Yeah.
User Interface: Yeah. That was our main technological innovation w every everything else was fairly simple, but the fact that we used the kinetic energy was new.
Project Manager: {gap}.
Marketing: So it's {gap}. So we'll give it a {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Well so the um {disfmarker}
User Interface: It's ergonomic,
Marketing: {vocalsound}
User Interface: but that's not {disfmarker} that's that's a design that's a des that's a design thing, yeah.
Project Manager: Yeah, but that's not a technological thing, that's another thing, i that's another marketing thing.
Industrial Designer: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. True.
Project Manager: So on the technical side of it it {disfmarker}
Marketing: Yeah. I'd say it's about a a twoish?
Industrial Designer: Two.
User Interface: It's about in the mid in the middle somewhere,
Marketing: Two.
User Interface: maybe, yeah, I dunno.
Marketing: Three.
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
User Interface: Maybe three, yeah.
Marketing: {gap} three. So criteria three is is it easy to use?
Project Manager: Easy to use.
Marketing: I think it's a one, I think.
Project Manager: I'd say it's I wouldn't {disfmarker}
User Interface: Yeah.
Project Manager: not if you're left-handed it's not. I would give it a I would give it a two,
User Interface: Mm.
Marketing: Two,
Project Manager:'cause i i it i it i it is more geared for right-handed people than left-handed people, but {disfmarker}
Marketing: so it's {disfmarker}
User Interface: Okay.
Industrial Designer: Mm.
Marketing: But if we make a right-handed and a left-handed then?
User Interface: If we're gonna have one left-handed and one right-handed then I would give it a one, but otherwise otherwise a two.
Project Manager: Yeah.
Marketing: Yeah.
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
Project Manager: Give it a t give it a two.
Marketing: Yeah, okay. {vocalsound}'Kay, criteria four is costs. {gap}
Project Manager: Cost. It's come in under budget.
Marketing: {vocalsound}'s great.
Project Manager: So that's a definite one.
User Interface: Yeah. That was great.
Marketing: Yeah.
Project Manager: Amount of buttons.
Marketing: Like the amount of buttons,
Project Manager: Contains only the necessary buttons.
Marketing:'cause people like a lot le like {disfmarker} So it's a one?
Project Manager: Yeah.
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
User Interface: Yeah.
Marketing: Um criteria six. R_S_I_ is it good against?
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} Yes s yeah.
Marketing: Yes. Very good.
Project Manager: So it's anti-R_S_I_.
Marketing: It's one. And criteria seven, which is the last one, does it get lost?
Industrial Designer: It's yellow.
Marketing: Is it easy to get lost?
Project Manager: I don't think it's gonna get lost easily.
User Interface: {vocalsound} It is very bright, yeah.
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Marketing: No? But it is smallish.
Industrial Designer: Two.
User Interface: It's not the kinda thing that's gonna slip like between a couch cushion or something, you know. Maybe it will. Uh.
Industrial Designer: T
Marketing: Mm. I think i it would, could be, could get lost.
User Interface: You think it could lost {disfmarker}
Project Manager: {gap} two.
Marketing: Mm. Yeah.
User Interface: Mm.
Project Manager: I mean it {disfmarker}
Marketing: I mean it's not fully it's not fully {disfmarker} like you can't say {disfmarker}
Project Manager: No, I mean
Marketing: I mean, it's not a one, definitely.
Project Manager: I mean, you could still flush it down the toilet theoretically, but {disfmarker}
User Interface: Okay. Yeah, anything, I mean. Okay. It's bigger than the average mobile, I guess.
Marketing: Yeah.
User Interface: But, yeah, it can get lost.
Marketing: The mobiles get lost all the time.
User Interface: Yeah. Okay, yeah, two is fine.
Marketing: But then you ring'em and you find them. {vocalsound} So {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Mm. Mm.
User Interface: Yeah, yeah.
Project Manager: Okay.
Marketing: Yeah. So, that's that. So that's the evaluation, so I'd say {disfmarker} Yay.
Project Manager: Alright it's all all systems go.
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} We've, we've done well.
Marketing: It's like {vocalsound} {gap} like a number one. Um.
User Interface: Yeah.
Marketing: Number one product.
User Interface: Mm.
Project Manager: {vocalsound} We can't fail.
Marketing: All done, thanks. We fitted all the criterias. {vocalsound}
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
Marketing: Yeah.
Project Manager: {gap}.
Marketing: Yeah, so {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Well done, Reissa.
Marketing: So that's that one.
Project Manager: Okay, I I think um I just wanna put in as Project Manager the you know, little bit of praise for everybody here for how they've worked on it,
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: you know, both individually and as a team. You know you've w everyone's come up with their own individual ideas in their own different departments, um and then come together and worked in, you know, integrally, you know, at the right times, psp, you know, especially you two.
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: That's all, you know, gone very very well
User Interface: Yeah.
Project Manager: and and and be you know, has been good communication going on. {vocalsound}
User Interface: Yeah, during our design I mean there was some s some heated heated discussion,
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
User Interface: but we we kept {disfmarker} we tried to keep it cool and and
Project Manager: {vocalsound} Did you have to go down to the the corporate squash court and bash a few balls about? {vocalsound}
Marketing: {vocalsound}
User Interface: just just {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Well.
User Interface: {vocalsound} We just had to we just had to squeeze our product a little bit and {disfmarker}
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: You know {disfmarker}
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: {vocalsound} Fantastic.
Industrial Designer: It is {gap}.
User Interface: Now you guys have been a a great team. Think we're the we're the envy of all the of all the other R_R_ teams, {gap}.
Marketing: {gap} been cool.
Project Manager: I think {disfmarker} So
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: I I, you know, and I think we've co we have come we've come up with something new, something that hasn't been done before, we haven't {disfmarker} we're not just rehashing an old design.
Marketing: In four diff in in four meetings.
Project Manager: Yeah.
Marketing: Funny, all designer meetings could be this quick.
Project Manager: You know, maybe this isn't a simulation, maybe this is actually {disfmarker} so it's like Sony or someone like that they're they're just, yeah, {gap} they get {gap} {disfmarker}
Marketing: {vocalsound}
User Interface: Yeah I think they're actually trying to find ideas for a ideal remote. {vocalsound}
Marketing: They're using our ideas.
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Yeah. Yeah, {gap} two years'time this will be on the market.
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Ex exactly that product
Marketing: {vocalsound}
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: um thum {disfmarker} we'll go, yeah, we designed that and no-one will believe us.
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: {vocalsound} But um {disfmarker}
User Interface: So at this stage, I mean, is this the last meeting of the project? We don't uh have another one after it's gone gone to marke market or something?
Marketing: Yeah.
Project Manager: No,
Marketing: {gap}
Project Manager: I think when this meeting's finished like officially, there b we'll get a uh questionnaire to fill in.
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: Y Oh really?
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: {vocalsound} Or six, uh {disfmarker}
Marketing: Just start summarising now. {vocalsound} You can reply to the same message.
Project Manager: I haven't got message.
Marketing: See summary, there. If you just reply to that one.
User Interface: So there's no way to like predict what our {disfmarker}'Cause we had a {disfmarker} we originally had a {vocalsound} {disfmarker} As far as our financial uh um goals, we had a specific number for profits that we wanted. It was fifty mil fifty million {disfmarker}
Marketing: Was it was it fifty or five?
User Interface: I don't remember. But there's not a way to compute that, I mean, since we saved on the on the production cost, do we know how much we're making on profit?
Project Manager: It gets handed over to another department.
Marketing: Depends how much we sell.
User Interface: Uh.
Project Manager: What our what our project was was to come up with the product, basically.
User Interface: Hmm.
Project Manager: {gap} the for the {disfmarker} and just basically is it it come {disfmarker} can {disfmarker} is it within budget. When it c when it comes to all the other things of how to sell it and, you know, the b the profits and all that that's other departments {disfmarker} it's another team that actually work out the mai the {disfmarker}
User Interface: But we have a vested interest {gap}
Project Manager: oh yeah, the {disfmarker} all the guys in the profit sharing, yeah.
User Interface: prof profit sharing {vocalsound}.
Project Manager: {vocalsound} Um. Yeah, that's it. You know, we've we've we've made i we've made
Marketing: We finished an hour earlier. {vocalsound}
Project Manager: we've designed the product, we've ma we've got the prototype, it's within budget, it's {disfmarker} does everything that we wanted it to do. It's new, it's it's um something that uh {vocalsound} that isn't out there already.
User Interface: I think actually {disfmarker} and one advantage of of this is that after the uh, you know, after this fad of fruit and vegetables passes this will still be c a cool remote, you know.
Marketing: Mm.
User Interface: We're not we're not you know, tying tying our cart to that one horse {gap}. {vocalsound}
Project Manager: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Yeah.
Marketing: Mm.
Project Manager: Well, this is very marketable in that it is it's it's something that's kind of new and looks a bit quirky for people who want that,
Marketing: Definitely.
Project Manager: it's {disfmarker} that it's um, hang on, I wrote it down here somewhere {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Oh no I thi I put it in one of my e-mails that I sent off. Um that, you know, it's marketable in the sense that it's {disfmarker} whilst all these other remotes uh actually do give you repetitive strain injury, our one does the complete opposite, you know,
User Interface: Mm. Mm.
Project Manager: so that's something that's new, which is one of the criteria they asked us to come up with something with something new.
User Interface: Mm. It make watching T_V_ healthy.
Project Manager: Yeah, and if you're not having a good time with the T_V_, you can f throw it about, you know.
Marketing: Yeah.
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: It's fine, it's kid proof.
Marketing: Just don't sh don't throw it at any of the ornaments and break them.
User Interface: Uh.
Project Manager: Well, you can break the ornaments, but you won't break that.
Marketing: No {gap}.
Project Manager: {vocalsound} Yeah. So all in all, I think we've done very well.
Industrial Designer: Mm yep.
Project Manager: Well done everybody.
User Interface: Right, you too.
Marketing: Yay.
Project Manager: Um. Drinks are on the company.
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: Cool.
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: In the corporate bar that's next to the corporate swimming pool on the top floor that we're that've all just gained access to.
User Interface: {vocalsound} Mm. {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: Glad to hear that.
Project Manager: {vocalsound} Yeah. That's it.
User Interface: That's it.
Project Manager: Well, as far as I t as far as I know. Um.
Marketing: Yep. We haven't got the five minute left thing yet.
Project Manager: No. Anyone wanna play I spy? {vocalsound}
Marketing: Mm mm.
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
User Interface: I guess it's probably better that we wrap it up than have five minutes of silence. Should we call the day then?
Project Manager: Yeah, I guess. I mean we're gonna get asked to fill out another questionnaire.
User Interface: Uh, right.
Project Manager: Um. It's probably gonna be the same as one we've done before.
User Interface: Mm-hmm.
Project Manager: But I'm not the authority to say that it is.
Marketing: In {gap} project.
Project Manager: Um how does everyone feel about the technology that's been used in this? The sort of using of the the pens and writing on these special pads and all that?
Marketing: I love it. {vocalsound} I love it. {vocalsound} I think it's cool.
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Marketing: {vocalsound} Being all wired up and a vibrating pen and {disfmarker} it's cool.
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
Marketing: Being watched. Um {disfmarker}
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Marketing: {vocalsound}
User Interface: Your moment to shine.
Project Manager: {vocalsound} Yeah.
Marketing: {vocalsound} Wow.
Project Manager: I thi you know, I'd I'd n yeah, as we said earlier, I've not {disfmarker} never seen that before. {gap} something that t the whiteboard
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
Project Manager: thingy, {vocalsound} that's great. Um, but a p a pen with a camera on it, I don't think it's such a new thing. I mean it's i or in such a new idea. It would be different if it was sort of hand writing recognition stuff, but as it's not {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
Project Manager: it's literally that'll come up on a computer screen as a picture file rather than actual text.
Marketing: Mm.
User Interface: Right, I think they do want to do hand writing recognition on that, it's just the first step.
Project Manager: Yeah. Yeah. Mm.
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Marketing: Logitech.
User Interface: I guess we should end this, since we're off off topic. So. Shall we {disfmarker}
Marketing: Yeah. Meeting adjourned.
User Interface: Right.
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Yeah.","The double curved prototype with anti-RSI buttons was ergonomic and comfortable to the size of the hand and to touch as it was made of rubber. The prototype was also easy and convenient to use as the important keys were right at the fingers. On the other hand, it brought fashion to electronics as the remote was offered in colours of black, yellow, blue and red, which contained fruit and vegetable elements. It was innovative and looked different so it would stand out from other remotes in the market.",qmsum
"Summarize the wrap up of the meeting.
Marketing: It's Play-Doh.
Project Manager: Play-Doh's edible. Did you know that? It's definitely {disfmarker}
Marketing: Because kids {disfmarker} yeah.
Industrial Designer: I used to eat it.
User Interface: I've, I've definitely eaten it before. I didn't know was edible. {vocalsound} {gap}.
Project Manager: Yeah. It's it's chew proof. {vocalsound}
Marketing: But um, it's it's made edible'cause, yeah. It's made edible'cause kids eat it,
Project Manager: Yeah.
Marketing: and if it's wasn't edible then {disfmarker} Well, normal babies. {vocalsound}
User Interface: Actually that makes sense, because I remember like, peopl I dunno if my Mom ever did it but I remember other people's Moms making like home-made Play-Doh where you just like make the {gap} colouring and make some sort of sort of dough.
Project Manager: Yeah.
Marketing: Oh yeah it is, yeah. Oh yeah.
Project Manager: {vocalsound} Right.
User Interface: Mm-hmm.
Project Manager: Everybody everybody ready?
Industrial Designer: Yep.
User Interface: Yeah.
Project Manager: Okay, let's have your um {disfmarker} let's get {gap} have the uh presentation?
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
User Interface: We've got some {gap}.
Industrial Designer: We've got a cool prototype.
User Interface: Yeah, it's pretty exciting. So, everything uh that we wanted we wanted it to be ergonomic and to be made out of rubber, very simple and easy to use,
Industrial Designer: Double curved.
Project Manager: Nice.
User Interface: yeah, double curved,
Marketing: {vocalsound}
User Interface: um but also something that was gonna jump out at people, something that would be different uh, separate it from the other remotes out on the market. So uh I think if you put this in the palm of your hand, you'll see what a nice thing we have going here.
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
Marketing: That is cool.
User Interface: So, basically, if you hold it like that, the one on your thumb, yeah, {vocalsound} the thumb button is the power button.
Project Manager: Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.
User Interface: Your index finger is channel up, middle finger is channel down, ring finger is volume up, your pinkie is volume down.
Marketing: What's the big blue thing?
User Interface: That's the lock button, has a L_ L_ on it
Marketing: Oh cool.
User Interface: and then the M_ is a mute button. And then it also has digit
Project Manager: {gap} what button? Um. Oh mute.
User Interface: For muting the uh {disfmarker}
Marketing: And mute.
User Interface: Um and then then you can also {disfmarker} there's a numeric keypad on the top so you can key directly to the to the channel if you want.
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Okay.
User Interface: So it's really basic functionalities as far as what keys are available, but we think it's very comfortable and very innovative and it looks different.
Project Manager: That certainly does.
Marketing: {vocalsound}
User Interface: So all the, I mean the important keys are right at your f f you know right at uh at a convenient place for you to to access them.
Project Manager: Mm.
Industrial Designer: Which is ant anti-R_S_I_.
User Interface: So you don't you {disfmarker} Yeah. It should be.
Project Manager: Mm.
User Interface: And it's also conformable to the size of your hand. I mean if that's too big, it's a rubber remote, so you can, you know
Project Manager: Yeah.'S great.
User Interface: change that. So d does that uh what {disfmarker} mesh with what you guys were hoping and for and expecting or does it {disfmarker}
Marketing: Oh it's so cute.
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: I have one thing about it, but it's a small thing, but it'd mean we'd have to make a right-handed one and a left-handed one.
Industrial Designer: Oh right, yeah.
User Interface: Ah, that's good thinking, yeah.
Project Manager: But, that's I don't see why that's not possible.
User Interface: Yeah, if we build rocket ships why can't we build left-handed and right-handed uh remotes.
Project Manager: Yeah. {gap} They make left-handed scissors, you know. {vocalsound}
User Interface: {vocalsound} Yeah, I didn't I didn't think about that, but I'd {disfmarker} yeah, {gap}.
Marketing: Yeah, but then but then you can learn to use your right h like I was just thinking if there's left-handers and right-handers in the family, what, they have two remotes?
Project Manager: Yes s
Industrial Designer: Yeah, I know I know people who have left-handed and right-handed people in the family and they all use the computer {vocalsound} for the whole {disfmarker} the same computer the fes family and they have a mouse, and everybody is using right-handed mouse.
Project Manager: Mm. Sure. Sure.
Marketing: Yeah, I'm sure they'll be able to {disfmarker}
User Interface: Uh-huh.
Marketing: I mean it's only pressing buttons, you don't have to do anything, you know, extraordinary. I think everybody can press a button with their left and right hand so {disfmarker}
User Interface: Yeah.
Industrial Designer: Imagine d are you right handed?
Project Manager: Yeah.
Industrial Designer: Imagine you're doing it with your left hand, I don't think it's too {disfmarker}
Marketing: Yeah, it's not {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: But we can have both uh {disfmarker}
Marketing: Yeah. Have them in stock.
Project Manager: Yeah.
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
Marketing: Make'em more appealing as well.
Project Manager: But um other than that, I mean uh and that's um, you know, that's just something, I think I think it's great, yeah, great idea.
User Interface: Do you think it says {vocalsound} R_R_?
Industrial Designer: {gap} I think it does. {vocalsound}
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: I think it's, well, if the R_R_ motto is, we bring fashion to to electronics, I'd say that could be quite fashionable.
User Interface: Fashion to electronics. Yeah.
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
User Interface: Yeah. And it's got the b the black and yellow and blue.
Project Manager: {vocalsound} Yeah.
User Interface: Plus red, which is sort of a a fruit and vegetable uh uh.
Project Manager: {vocalsound} Yeah.
Marketing: {gap}. {vocalsound} {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} There you go.
User Interface: So that's that's {vocalsound} our end of things wha uh {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Yeah, very good, yeah.
User Interface: That's {disfmarker}
Project Manager: It's come up with what we've you know, the things that's what we've {disfmarker} what we were looking at doing, hasn't it, {gap} all seems to be there.
User Interface: Yeah.
Project Manager: Well done.
Marketing: And all the playing around is uh {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Um before we move on {disfmarker}
Marketing: Yeah, I'm just {disfmarker} do you wanna plug in?
Project Manager: I need that cable.
Marketing: Okay.
Project Manager: Thank you. Yeah. Um. One thing I do need to do {disfmarker} we need to look at, is the costs.
User Interface: The costs, was that what you said?
Industrial Designer: Play-Doh is very cheap. {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Well, yeah. {vocalsound}
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Marketing: Mm.
Project Manager: {gap} um {disfmarker}
Marketing: Play-Doh won't last very long everybody'll go like, oops, it's gone. {vocalsound} {vocalsound}
User Interface: But it's edible.
Marketing: Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.
Industrial Designer: Chew proof.
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Marketing: Well, they'll buy more of them if you eat them, {gap}.
User Interface: That was the main criteria from the last meeting, it had to be chew proof.
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Yeah. Uh right. {vocalsound} Okay, now I think we'll do this {disfmarker} I could do {disfmarker} you know, I can do this o on my own or I could do it with you,
Marketing: Yeah.
Industrial Designer: Oh ho-ho.
Project Manager: but it's just easy enough to go through it with you, so we're going for the kinetic power.
Industrial Designer: Yep.
Project Manager: {vocalsound} And the electronics, we decided on it being just a simple, the easiest thing that's inside it. Ooh.
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: So {disfmarker} the case, we've gone for the double curved. Um and it's made out of rubber. {vocalsound} The interface is push-buttons. And button supplements well they're in diff special colours, aren't they?
Marketing: Yeah.
Project Manager: So {gap} special colours.
User Interface: Yeah.
Marketing: It's better for {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Special form, yeah, they're a special form there in shapes and stuff.
User Interface: Yeah, I mean, {vocalsound} these these ones on the side are curved kind of, so {disfmarker}
Marketing: And special material.
Project Manager: Yep. Yeah. Um. Are they made out of any special material?
Industrial Designer: Rubber.
Project Manager: No they're not. They're not made out of wood or titanium or rubber or anything, they're just simple {disfmarker}
User Interface: The buttons are rubber.
Marketing: Well they're rubber, aren't they?
Project Manager: Okay. Right.
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
Project Manager: So let's see if that comes within budget. And it does. That is gonna cost uh {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: {gap}.
Marketing: We're under budget.
Project Manager: Yeah. That's gonna cost ten ten Euro seventy cents a unit to make. And our target was it had to come in at under twelve fifty.
User Interface: That's cool. Yeah. Yeah.
Project Manager: So,
User Interface: And we're actua actually making a better profit than we expected.
Project Manager: this is all very very good. The bosses will be very pleased.
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Okay, let's just save this so I can e-mail it to you. Uh.
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: {vocalsound} Save it in {gap} save it in the uh {vocalsound} my documents.
Marketing: It's already saved, I think.
Project Manager: Splendid. Okay. So uh, that's {gap} done with this with this um doodah, so you're {gap}. Gonna do {disfmarker} what you were gonna do,
Marketing: Thank you. Mm.
Project Manager: your evaluation.
Marketing: Oh, yeah. This is where we all get to {vocalsound} I get to write on the, oops, on the board. Right.
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
Marketing: Oh.'S function {disfmarker}
Project Manager: F_ eight.
Marketing: Okay.
Project Manager: {gap} I love the smell of that Play-Doh.
User Interface: {vocalsound} Yeah,
Project Manager: {vocalsound} I cou {gap}. {vocalsound}
Marketing: Mm.
User Interface: have some have some.
Marketing: Okay. So, {vocalsound} evaluation. We're gonna do it all together so we evaluate each criteria. I've got the criterias. And we have to do it on a scale of one to seven, one being true, so it's it's more like it's {disfmarker} fits the criteria, and seven being as in it doesn't fit the criteria. And the criterias are, and I'll draw this up on the board {disfmarker} {vocalsound} so we have a box {disfmarker} {gap}. And this is false, this is just like to keep you informed. So seven's here and one's here and then you've got in the middle. {vocalsound} So the first criteria. Do you all get what we're doing?
Industrial Designer: Mm-hmm.
User Interface: Mm-hmm.
Marketing: Okay, cool. Okay, first criteria, look and feel. So the does remote look and feel fashionable to what we talked about? As it {disfmarker} is it colour-wise and is it spongy?
User Interface: Mm.
Marketing: So what mark should we give for that?
Project Manager: I would give it a seven.
User Interface: Yeah.
Marketing: As in it's not.
Project Manager: Oh sorry, one, d yeah.
User Interface: Oh, sorry, one. {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: A one.
Marketing: A one a one. So I'll just write criteria criteria one we get one. Second criteria, new technology. Have we implemented new technology? As in the new high-tech {vocalsound} {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Well, the kinetic thing, yeah.
Project Manager: Yeah.
User Interface: Yeah. That was our main technological innovation w every everything else was fairly simple, but the fact that we used the kinetic energy was new.
Project Manager: {gap}.
Marketing: So it's {gap}. So we'll give it a {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Well so the um {disfmarker}
User Interface: It's ergonomic,
Marketing: {vocalsound}
User Interface: but that's not {disfmarker} that's that's a design that's a des that's a design thing, yeah.
Project Manager: Yeah, but that's not a technological thing, that's another thing, i that's another marketing thing.
Industrial Designer: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. True.
Project Manager: So on the technical side of it it {disfmarker}
Marketing: Yeah. I'd say it's about a a twoish?
Industrial Designer: Two.
User Interface: It's about in the mid in the middle somewhere,
Marketing: Two.
User Interface: maybe, yeah, I dunno.
Marketing: Three.
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
User Interface: Maybe three, yeah.
Marketing: {gap} three. So criteria three is is it easy to use?
Project Manager: Easy to use.
Marketing: I think it's a one, I think.
Project Manager: I'd say it's I wouldn't {disfmarker}
User Interface: Yeah.
Project Manager: not if you're left-handed it's not. I would give it a I would give it a two,
User Interface: Mm.
Marketing: Two,
Project Manager:'cause i i it i it i it is more geared for right-handed people than left-handed people, but {disfmarker}
Marketing: so it's {disfmarker}
User Interface: Okay.
Industrial Designer: Mm.
Marketing: But if we make a right-handed and a left-handed then?
User Interface: If we're gonna have one left-handed and one right-handed then I would give it a one, but otherwise otherwise a two.
Project Manager: Yeah.
Marketing: Yeah.
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
Project Manager: Give it a t give it a two.
Marketing: Yeah, okay. {vocalsound}'Kay, criteria four is costs. {gap}
Project Manager: Cost. It's come in under budget.
Marketing: {vocalsound}'s great.
Project Manager: So that's a definite one.
User Interface: Yeah. That was great.
Marketing: Yeah.
Project Manager: Amount of buttons.
Marketing: Like the amount of buttons,
Project Manager: Contains only the necessary buttons.
Marketing:'cause people like a lot le like {disfmarker} So it's a one?
Project Manager: Yeah.
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
User Interface: Yeah.
Marketing: Um criteria six. R_S_I_ is it good against?
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} Yes s yeah.
Marketing: Yes. Very good.
Project Manager: So it's anti-R_S_I_.
Marketing: It's one. And criteria seven, which is the last one, does it get lost?
Industrial Designer: It's yellow.
Marketing: Is it easy to get lost?
Project Manager: I don't think it's gonna get lost easily.
User Interface: {vocalsound} It is very bright, yeah.
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Marketing: No? But it is smallish.
Industrial Designer: Two.
User Interface: It's not the kinda thing that's gonna slip like between a couch cushion or something, you know. Maybe it will. Uh.
Industrial Designer: T
Marketing: Mm. I think i it would, could be, could get lost.
User Interface: You think it could lost {disfmarker}
Project Manager: {gap} two.
Marketing: Mm. Yeah.
User Interface: Mm.
Project Manager: I mean it {disfmarker}
Marketing: I mean it's not fully it's not fully {disfmarker} like you can't say {disfmarker}
Project Manager: No, I mean
Marketing: I mean, it's not a one, definitely.
Project Manager: I mean, you could still flush it down the toilet theoretically, but {disfmarker}
User Interface: Okay. Yeah, anything, I mean. Okay. It's bigger than the average mobile, I guess.
Marketing: Yeah.
User Interface: But, yeah, it can get lost.
Marketing: The mobiles get lost all the time.
User Interface: Yeah. Okay, yeah, two is fine.
Marketing: But then you ring'em and you find them. {vocalsound} So {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Mm. Mm.
User Interface: Yeah, yeah.
Project Manager: Okay.
Marketing: Yeah. So, that's that. So that's the evaluation, so I'd say {disfmarker} Yay.
Project Manager: Alright it's all all systems go.
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} We've, we've done well.
Marketing: It's like {vocalsound} {gap} like a number one. Um.
User Interface: Yeah.
Marketing: Number one product.
User Interface: Mm.
Project Manager: {vocalsound} We can't fail.
Marketing: All done, thanks. We fitted all the criterias. {vocalsound}
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
Marketing: Yeah.
Project Manager: {gap}.
Marketing: Yeah, so {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Well done, Reissa.
Marketing: So that's that one.
Project Manager: Okay, I I think um I just wanna put in as Project Manager the you know, little bit of praise for everybody here for how they've worked on it,
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: you know, both individually and as a team. You know you've w everyone's come up with their own individual ideas in their own different departments, um and then come together and worked in, you know, integrally, you know, at the right times, psp, you know, especially you two.
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: That's all, you know, gone very very well
User Interface: Yeah.
Project Manager: and and and be you know, has been good communication going on. {vocalsound}
User Interface: Yeah, during our design I mean there was some s some heated heated discussion,
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
User Interface: but we we kept {disfmarker} we tried to keep it cool and and
Project Manager: {vocalsound} Did you have to go down to the the corporate squash court and bash a few balls about? {vocalsound}
Marketing: {vocalsound}
User Interface: just just {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Well.
User Interface: {vocalsound} We just had to we just had to squeeze our product a little bit and {disfmarker}
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: You know {disfmarker}
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: {vocalsound} Fantastic.
Industrial Designer: It is {gap}.
User Interface: Now you guys have been a a great team. Think we're the we're the envy of all the of all the other R_R_ teams, {gap}.
Marketing: {gap} been cool.
Project Manager: I think {disfmarker} So
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: I I, you know, and I think we've co we have come we've come up with something new, something that hasn't been done before, we haven't {disfmarker} we're not just rehashing an old design.
Marketing: In four diff in in four meetings.
Project Manager: Yeah.
Marketing: Funny, all designer meetings could be this quick.
Project Manager: You know, maybe this isn't a simulation, maybe this is actually {disfmarker} so it's like Sony or someone like that they're they're just, yeah, {gap} they get {gap} {disfmarker}
Marketing: {vocalsound}
User Interface: Yeah I think they're actually trying to find ideas for a ideal remote. {vocalsound}
Marketing: They're using our ideas.
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Yeah. Yeah, {gap} two years'time this will be on the market.
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Ex exactly that product
Marketing: {vocalsound}
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: um thum {disfmarker} we'll go, yeah, we designed that and no-one will believe us.
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: {vocalsound} But um {disfmarker}
User Interface: So at this stage, I mean, is this the last meeting of the project? We don't uh have another one after it's gone gone to marke market or something?
Marketing: Yeah.
Project Manager: No,
Marketing: {gap}
Project Manager: I think when this meeting's finished like officially, there b we'll get a uh questionnaire to fill in.
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: Y Oh really?
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: {vocalsound} Or six, uh {disfmarker}
Marketing: Just start summarising now. {vocalsound} You can reply to the same message.
Project Manager: I haven't got message.
Marketing: See summary, there. If you just reply to that one.
User Interface: So there's no way to like predict what our {disfmarker}'Cause we had a {disfmarker} we originally had a {vocalsound} {disfmarker} As far as our financial uh um goals, we had a specific number for profits that we wanted. It was fifty mil fifty million {disfmarker}
Marketing: Was it was it fifty or five?
User Interface: I don't remember. But there's not a way to compute that, I mean, since we saved on the on the production cost, do we know how much we're making on profit?
Project Manager: It gets handed over to another department.
Marketing: Depends how much we sell.
User Interface: Uh.
Project Manager: What our what our project was was to come up with the product, basically.
User Interface: Hmm.
Project Manager: {gap} the for the {disfmarker} and just basically is it it come {disfmarker} can {disfmarker} is it within budget. When it c when it comes to all the other things of how to sell it and, you know, the b the profits and all that that's other departments {disfmarker} it's another team that actually work out the mai the {disfmarker}
User Interface: But we have a vested interest {gap}
Project Manager: oh yeah, the {disfmarker} all the guys in the profit sharing, yeah.
User Interface: prof profit sharing {vocalsound}.
Project Manager: {vocalsound} Um. Yeah, that's it. You know, we've we've we've made i we've made
Marketing: We finished an hour earlier. {vocalsound}
Project Manager: we've designed the product, we've ma we've got the prototype, it's within budget, it's {disfmarker} does everything that we wanted it to do. It's new, it's it's um something that uh {vocalsound} that isn't out there already.
User Interface: I think actually {disfmarker} and one advantage of of this is that after the uh, you know, after this fad of fruit and vegetables passes this will still be c a cool remote, you know.
Marketing: Mm.
User Interface: We're not we're not you know, tying tying our cart to that one horse {gap}. {vocalsound}
Project Manager: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Yeah.
Marketing: Mm.
Project Manager: Well, this is very marketable in that it is it's it's something that's kind of new and looks a bit quirky for people who want that,
Marketing: Definitely.
Project Manager: it's {disfmarker} that it's um, hang on, I wrote it down here somewhere {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Oh no I thi I put it in one of my e-mails that I sent off. Um that, you know, it's marketable in the sense that it's {disfmarker} whilst all these other remotes uh actually do give you repetitive strain injury, our one does the complete opposite, you know,
User Interface: Mm. Mm.
Project Manager: so that's something that's new, which is one of the criteria they asked us to come up with something with something new.
User Interface: Mm. It make watching T_V_ healthy.
Project Manager: Yeah, and if you're not having a good time with the T_V_, you can f throw it about, you know.
Marketing: Yeah.
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: It's fine, it's kid proof.
Marketing: Just don't sh don't throw it at any of the ornaments and break them.
User Interface: Uh.
Project Manager: Well, you can break the ornaments, but you won't break that.
Marketing: No {gap}.
Project Manager: {vocalsound} Yeah. So all in all, I think we've done very well.
Industrial Designer: Mm yep.
Project Manager: Well done everybody.
User Interface: Right, you too.
Marketing: Yay.
Project Manager: Um. Drinks are on the company.
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: Cool.
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: In the corporate bar that's next to the corporate swimming pool on the top floor that we're that've all just gained access to.
User Interface: {vocalsound} Mm. {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: Glad to hear that.
Project Manager: {vocalsound} Yeah. That's it.
User Interface: That's it.
Project Manager: Well, as far as I t as far as I know. Um.
Marketing: Yep. We haven't got the five minute left thing yet.
Project Manager: No. Anyone wanna play I spy? {vocalsound}
Marketing: Mm mm.
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
User Interface: I guess it's probably better that we wrap it up than have five minutes of silence. Should we call the day then?
Project Manager: Yeah, I guess. I mean we're gonna get asked to fill out another questionnaire.
User Interface: Uh, right.
Project Manager: Um. It's probably gonna be the same as one we've done before.
User Interface: Mm-hmm.
Project Manager: But I'm not the authority to say that it is.
Marketing: In {gap} project.
Project Manager: Um how does everyone feel about the technology that's been used in this? The sort of using of the the pens and writing on these special pads and all that?
Marketing: I love it. {vocalsound} I love it. {vocalsound} I think it's cool.
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Marketing: {vocalsound} Being all wired up and a vibrating pen and {disfmarker} it's cool.
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
Marketing: Being watched. Um {disfmarker}
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Marketing: {vocalsound}
User Interface: Your moment to shine.
Project Manager: {vocalsound} Yeah.
Marketing: {vocalsound} Wow.
Project Manager: I thi you know, I'd I'd n yeah, as we said earlier, I've not {disfmarker} never seen that before. {gap} something that t the whiteboard
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
Project Manager: thingy, {vocalsound} that's great. Um, but a p a pen with a camera on it, I don't think it's such a new thing. I mean it's i or in such a new idea. It would be different if it was sort of hand writing recognition stuff, but as it's not {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
Project Manager: it's literally that'll come up on a computer screen as a picture file rather than actual text.
Marketing: Mm.
User Interface: Right, I think they do want to do hand writing recognition on that, it's just the first step.
Project Manager: Yeah. Yeah. Mm.
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Marketing: Logitech.
User Interface: I guess we should end this, since we're off off topic. So. Shall we {disfmarker}
Marketing: Yeah. Meeting adjourned.
User Interface: Right.
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Yeah.","The remote fits all criteria and it was something novel. Also, it was marketable in the sense that other remotes would give users repetitive strain injury but this remote would do the complete opposite. Project Manager concluded that everyone had done a great job, both individually and as a team. Though there was some heated discussion during designing the remote, the communication was still great. For the technology that had been used during meetings, Marketing thought it was quite cool.",qmsum
"In the discussion of favourite animals, what was said about User Interface's choice?
Project Manager: Okay. Hi everybody and welcome to our kick-off meeting um for our new product that we're gonna be designing. Um I'm Mandy and I'm the Project Manager. And I know all your names again, Courtney, Fenella and Amber.
Marketing: Yep.
Project Manager: Alright. Okay,
Industrial Designer: Yep.
Project Manager: so first let's go through this PowerPoint. I wonder what button I press?
User Interface: Just do it on the {gap} arrow.
Industrial Designer: {gap}
Project Manager: Yeah, or how about I just click? Okay, here is our agenda for this meeting. Um we're gonna start with our opening which was our introductions. {vocalsound} We're gonna get to know each other a little bit better. Um tool training, we're going to, I guess, figure out what to do on this project with our individual roles. Um we're gonna make a project plan and then have some time for discussion and close up the meeting. Okay, here is our project. We're gonna make a new remote control that's um original, trendy and also user-friendly. And how we are going to do it is each of us is going to um {disfmarker} We're gonna have {disfmarker} discuss the functional design first, {vocalsound} how is it gonna be used, what's the actual goal here, it has to operate T_V_, blah blah blah. And we're going to do individual work on that and then meet. Same thing with conceptual design. Just the basic overview of the project and then we're going to do individual work, meet. That's pretty much the the whole process for today. And then the detailed design, just more in-depth, get the actual schematics of the remote. Okay. Alright. First we're gonna start off by using our tools. And the whiteboard thing, do you guys wanna give that a try even though the ink wasn't working or do you wanna do it on here.
Industrial Designer: I think we should forgo the whiteboard since we can't actually see what we're writing.
Marketing: We could {disfmarker} Yeah, we could on here.
Project Manager: Alright, let's go forward then.
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Um right now so we're all gonna draw our favourite animal and then sum up our favourite characteristics of that animal. Even if you are not a good drawer like me.
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: {vocalsound} Alright.
Industrial Designer: Artistic skills, nil.
User Interface: Fine.
Project Manager: Um.
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Marketing: {vocalsound} Oh, thanks. {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Bless you.
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} I draw like I'm in grade five.
Project Manager: {vocalsound} Oh do I.
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: {vocalsound}'Kay, about one more minute. {vocalsound} Okay.
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Okay. And who would like to start us off?
Marketing: I'll go.
Project Manager: Alright.
Marketing: {vocalsound} Um this is my picture. I drew fish {disfmarker} {vocalsound} I like fish, because uh, you know, their whole water-vascular system thing.
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Marketing: It's pretty cool, and um they've got a pretty good habitat and they are pretty sometimes, sometimes vicious but that's okay.
Project Manager: {vocalsound} Only if they're piranhas.
Marketing: Yeah.
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Marketing: Yeah, they they're easy, you know.
Project Manager: Alright.
Marketing: Yeah.
Project Manager: Who wants to go next?
Industrial Designer: I'll go.
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: I drew a kitty. It's pretty much impossible to tell that's a cat, but I love cats.
Marketing: No I I see it.
Project Manager: No, it looks like a cat.
User Interface: No, I kne I knew.
Marketing: Yeah, it does look like a cat.
Industrial Designer: I love cats because they're independent, uh they pretty much know what they want, they get it, they move on. {vocalsound}
Project Manager: I love cats, too. I'm a cat person.
User Interface: Yeah.
Marketing: I'm allergic to cats.
Project Manager: Uh.
Industrial Designer: I'm allergic to cats, too. {vocalsound}
User Interface: Ah.
Marketing: {vocalsound} Oh, okay. {vocalsound}
Project Manager: If you're around one {disfmarker}
User Interface: In my next life.
Project Manager: I had a roommate who was um allergic, but if she was around my cat forever she became used to it, you know,
Marketing: Yeah, yeah, if you're around them for a long period of time {disfmarker}
Project Manager: it's weird. Okay. {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: I still can't sleep with them in my room.
Marketing: Oh, yeah, this summer I, oh I had to live with cats. It was crazy.
Project Manager: Okay, Fenella?
Marketing: Yeah.
User Interface: Um, I drew a badger. {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Badger. Good choice.
Industrial Designer: Yay.
Marketing: Cool. {vocalsound}
User Interface: {vocalsound} Well, yeah.
Project Manager: Why a badger?
User Interface: {vocalsound} Uh I dunno, they're grumpy and nocturnal and {vocalsound} {gap}
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} Are you trying to suggest something?
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
User Interface: Well, a little bit like the {disfmarker} Yes. Um. {vocalsound} And then, if you know Wind in the Willows {gap} badger.
Marketing: Oh, okay.
User Interface: Yeah and then uh I don't know if you know Brian {gap}. He's Liverpudlian writer.
Project Manager: Alright.
User Interface: Um {gap}, that kind of books. Badgers are cool in that one too. {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Okay. And I'm last.'Kay. Look at my sad sad giraffe.
Marketing: No, that's good.
Project Manager: No, no, no, it ends up looking like some kind of a dinosaur, but whatever. I don't know even much about giraffes, but I just love the way they look. They're just such odd creatures, you know. I I like that they're so unique and individual, I guess. I don't know much about their behaviour or anything, though. Only seen a couple in zoos.
Marketing: You don't really have to, I mean, if you like'em {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Yeah, but you can appreciate the way they look. Okay. Alright. Guess we're getting straight back into business here.
User Interface: {gap}
Project Manager: Um the selling price for our remote is going to be twenty-five Euro, and our profit aim is fifty million Euro. We're going to make this an international product marketed in the States, in Europe, in Asia. And um our production cost to make that profit is gonna be a max of twelve fifty Euro per remote. Okay. So we're gonna talk for a little while. Um here are some topics that we might be able to discuss. Expe our experiences with remote controls um, our first ideas about this new remote, anything that you can bring to the table for this project. So.
User Interface: Now?
Project Manager: Yeah. You wanna start us off? Anybody have anything to offer?
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: Well, we wanna make a multifunctional remote, right?
Project Manager: Right.
Industrial Designer: One remote for everything.
User Interface: And everything being {disfmarker} Wait, we have what, sound system, T_V_, D_V_D_, V_H_S_, uh TiVo?
Marketing: Right.
Industrial Designer: Um. I think they'll be phasing V_H_S_ out shortly.
Marketing: Yeah, TiVo.
Project Manager: TiVo.
User Interface: But it's still there, so
Industrial Designer: Okay.
User Interface: if po if we're gonna do it {disfmarker}
Marketing: It needs to be compatible'cause universal remote controls are never universal.
Project Manager: They're never universal. That's right. Esp e especially if you buy a a not big product, D_V_D_ player, say, usually it doesn't work if it's not one of the {disfmarker}
User Interface: Or if it's not like a Sony, if it's like a {disfmarker} I don't know.
Project Manager: Yeah. Yeah. Something from Sam's club.
Industrial Designer: So we'll have to figure it how to cover all the different variances in signals.
Project Manager: Yeah.
Marketing: And what we need an insanely good instruction booklet, because you always have to reconfigure all your contraptions to go with the remote anyways.
Project Manager: Yeah.'Kay, and um another thing that I think is important is the d the design of the product, how it feels in your hand. If it's just flat and kind of boring th those don't {disfmarker} Nobody wants to buy those any more. They want the ergonomic ones.
Marketing: They want like the flashy lights.
Project Manager: Yeah.
Marketing: Oh like this came from Las Vegas.
Project Manager: Ones that ones that look high-tech, too.
User Interface: But at the same time are simple.
Project Manager: Right.
Marketing: Mm yeah.
Project Manager: So that people like my mother can use it.
Industrial Designer: What about something with the curvature like that matches the curvature of a hand?
Project Manager: Yeah.
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Project Manager:'Kay. Anybody have any experiences with remote controls that they can remember that {disfmarker}
User Interface: Just bad ones. {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Yeah {gap}. {vocalsound} That's true.
User Interface: Um.
Industrial Designer: What kinda battery would we want to use? Because battery changing is usually {disfmarker}
User Interface: D Double A_.
Marketing: Double A_.
Industrial Designer: Okay.
Project Manager: Do some of them use triple A_s though?
Marketing: Yeah some use triple A_s.
Project Manager: Okay.
User Interface: Some but {disfmarker}
Marketing: So double or triple?
User Interface: Yeah, I guess then it's {disfmarker} If we need to do triple A_ we can, but most people usually have double A_s around.
Project Manager: Okay. Yeah. But that has to do with the size of it too. Well, w as long as we know that issue is {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
User Interface: Right.
Project Manager: Here we can {disfmarker}
Marketing: Yeah, if we want it to be more thin, then we'd probably wanna go with a triple A_.
Project Manager: Triple A. But
Industrial Designer: Can you {gap} with a small lithium battery?
Project Manager: it's okay, we don't have to decide about it now, just as long as we remember battery type and size is important.
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Hey. Anything else? Alright. Moving along. Oh, we're closing the meeting. Next meeting is gonna start in thirty minutes. Here's what we're going to do. Um the I_D_, which is who? Okay, you're going to think about the working design. What do you think that means? {vocalsound}
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Okay. And U_I_D_, the technical fun functions design,
User Interface: Mm-hmm.
Project Manager: making sure it does everything that we need the remote to do, the functionality of it, operating all those different things. Okay. And the marketing person, that's Courtney, is going to do the user requirements specification. I guess that means specifying um what exactly the user is going to be looking for. Right? I would think so. Okay.
Marketing: Right.
Project Manager: And you're gonna get more specific instructions emailed to you in just a little while. Okay, so does anybody have anything they wanna say before we close the meeting? Okay. This meeting is officially over.","The animal User Interface drew was a badger. When Project Manager demanded the reason for this unusual choice, User Interface first answered that it was because badgers were grumpy and nocturnal. Industrial Designer joked about whether this suggested that User Interface had the same characteristics. User Interface then explained that his/her favourable impression of the badger came from books like Wind in the Willow, where badgers were cooler animals than what people generally imagine them to be.",qmsum
