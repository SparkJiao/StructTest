"SEC’s financial statements, including the accompanying notes, present fairly, in all material respects, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, SEC’s assets, liabilities, net position, net costs, changes in net position, budgetary resources, and custodial activity as of, and for the fiscal years ended, September 30, 2007, and September 30, 2006. However, misstatements may nevertheless occur in other financial information reported by SEC and may not be prevented or detected because of the internal control deficiencies described in this report. As disclosed in footnote 1.C. to SEC’s financial statements, in fiscal year 2007, SEC changed its method of accounting for user fees collected in excess of current-year appropriations. Because of the material weakness and significant deficiencies in internal control discussed below, SEC did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2007, and thus did not have reasonable assurance that misstatements material in relation to the financial statements would be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Although certain compliance controls should be improved, SEC maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over compliance with laws and regulations as of September 30, 2007, that provided reasonable assurance that noncompliance with laws and regulations that could have a direct and material effect on the financial statements would be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Our opinion on internal control is based on criteria established under 31 U.S.C. § 3512(c)(d), commonly referred to as the Federal Managers’ Financial Integrity Act (FMFIA) and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular No. A-123, Management Accountability and Control. During this year’s audit, we identified significant control deficiencies in SEC’s financial reporting process, which taken collectively, result in more than a remote likelihood that a material misstatement of the financial statements will not be prevented or detected. Therefore, we considered the combination of the following control deficiencies to collectively constitute a material weakness in SEC’s financial reporting process: period-end financial reporting process, disgorgements and penalties accounts receivable, accounting for transaction fee revenue, and preparing financial statement disclosures. In addition to the material weakness discussed above, we identified three significant deficiencies in internal control, which although not material weaknesses, represent significant deficiencies in the design or operation of internal control. Although we are considering these issues separately from the material weakness described above, they nevertheless adversely affect SEC’s ability to meet financial reporting and other internal control objectives. These deficiencies concern property and equipment, and accounting for budgetary resources. In our prior year audit, we reported on weaknesses we identified in the areas of SEC’s (1) recording and reporting of disgorgements and penalties, (2) information systems controls, and (3) property and equipment controls. During fiscal year 2007, SEC improved its controls over the accuracy, timeliness, and completeness of the disgorgement and penalty data and used a much improved database for the initial recording and tracking of these data. However, the processing of these data for financial reporting purposes is still done through a manual process that is prone to error. We found that the internal controls that compensated for the manual processing of the related accounts receivable balances in fiscal year 2006 were not effective in fiscal year 2007. This issue is included in the material weakness in SEC’s financial reporting process for fiscal year 2007. SEC continues to make progress in resolving the information security weaknesses. Previously identified weaknesses, though, still need to be addressed, along with new weaknesses we found during this year’s audit. Therefore, we consider information security to be a significant deficiency as of September 30, 2007. In addition, we continued to identify the same weaknesses in controls over property and equipment during this year’s audit, and therefore, we considered this area to be a significant deficiency as of September 30, 2007. Although SEC had one material weakness and three significant control deficiencies in internal control, SEC’s financial statements were fairly stated in all material respects for fiscal years 2007 and 2006. However, the weaknesses in internal control noted above may adversely affect decisions by SEC management that is based, in whole or in part, on information that is inaccurate because of this weakness. In addition, unaudited financial information reported by SEC, including performance information, may also contain misstatements resulting from these weaknesses. We will be reporting additional details concerning the material weakness and the significant deficiencies separately to SEC management, along with recommendations for corrective actions. We will also be reporting less significant matters involving SEC’s system of internal controls separately to SEC management. During this year’s audit, we found control deficiencies in SEC’s period-end financial reporting process, in its calculation of accounts receivable for disgorgements and penalties, in its accounting for transaction fee revenue, and in preparing its financial statement disclosures. We believe these control deficiencies, collectively, constitute a material weakness. SEC’s financial management system does not conform to the systems requirements of OMB Circular No. A-127, Financial Management Systems. Specifically, Circular No. A-127 requires that financial management systems be designed to provide for effective and efficient interrelationships between software, hardware, personnel, procedures, controls, and data contained within the systems. Circular No. A-127 further states that financial systems must have common data elements, common transaction processing, consistent internal controls, and efficient transaction entry, and that reports produced by the systems shall provide financial data that can be traced directly to the general ledger accounts. SEC’s period-end financial reporting process for recording transactions, maintaining account balances, and preparing financial statements and disclosures are supported to varying degrees by a collection of automated systems that are not integrated or compatible with its general ledger system. These automated systems’ lack of integration and compatibility require that extensive compensating manual and labor-intensive accounting procedures, involving large spreadsheets and numerous posting and routine correcting journal entries, dominate SEC’s period-end financial reporting process. Some of SEC’s subsidiary systems, such as that for property and equipment and for disgorgements and penalties, do not share common data elements and common transaction processing with the general ledger system. Therefore, intermediary information processing steps, including extensive use of spreadsheets, manipulation of data, and manual journal entries, are needed to process the information in SEC’s general ledger. This processing complicates review of the transactions and greatly increases the risk that the transactions are not recorded completely, properly, or consistently, ultimately affecting the reliability of the data presented in the financial statements. Our identification this year of errors in SEC’s calculation of disgorgement and penalty accounts receivable, discussed below, illustrates this risk. The risk to data reliability is further increased because basic controls over electronic data, such as worksheet and password protection, change history, and controls over data verification, such as control totals and record counts, were not consistently used during the data processing between the source systems and the general ledger. In addition, currently, SEC’s general ledger has several unconventional posting models and other limitations that prevent proper recording of certain transactions. As a result, SEC’s year-end reporting process requires extensive routine correcting journal entries to correct errors created by incorrectly posted transactions in its general ledger. We also noted that SEC’s documentation used to crosswalk individual accounts to the financial statement line items contained an incorrect routing to a line item on SEC’s Statement of Budgetary Resources for SEC’s year-end financial statement preparation process, which caused a material error in SEC’s draft financial statements. Also, SEC did not have detailed written documentation of its methodologies and processes for preparing financial statements and disclosures, increasing the risk of inconsistent and improper reporting and the risk that disruptions and error may arise when staff turnover occurs. As part of its enforcement responsibilities, SEC issues orders and administers judgments ordering, among other things, disgorgements, civil monetary penalties, and interest against violators of federal securities laws. SEC recognizes a receivable when SEC is designated in an order or a final judgment to collect the assessed disgorgements, penalties, and interest. At September 30, 2007, the gross amount of disgorgements and penalties accounts receivable was $330 million, with a corresponding allowance of $266 million resulting in a net receivable of $64 million. In our reviews of the interim June 30, 2007, and year-end September 30, 2007, balances of accounts receivable for disgorgements and penalties, we found errors in SEC’s spreadsheet formulas resulting in overstatements of these receivable balances for both periods. These errors consisted of incorrectly changed spreadsheet formulas that affected the final calculated balances. SEC subsequently detected and corrected the June 30 errors, but then made different spreadsheet calculation errors in the year-end balances as of September 30, 2007, which we detected as part of our audit. SEC made adjustments to correct the errors, which were not material. However, SEC’s process for calculating its accounts receivable for disgorgements and penalties presents a high risk that significant errors could occur and not be detected. The main cause of these errors is the breakdown this year in the manual controls that were intended to compensate for the lack of an integrated accounting system for disgorgements and penalties, as discussed above. Specifically, although the journal entries posting the amounts to the general ledger were reviewed, this review did not extend to the preparation of the spreadsheet SEC used to document the accounts receivable calculation at June 30 and September 30, 2007, and therefore, was not sufficient to detect significant spreadsheet formula errors. As one of its sources of revenue, SEC collects securities transaction fees paid by self-regulatory organizations (SRO) to SEC for stock transactions. SRO transaction fees are payable to the SEC twice a year –in March for the previous months September through December, and in September for the previous months January through August. Since the SROs are not required to report the actual volume of transactions until 10 business days after each month end, SEC estimates and records an amount receivable for fees payable by the SROs to SEC for activity during the month of September. At September 30, 2007, SEC estimated this receivable amount at $100.6 million. Based on information SEC received in mid-October concerning the actual volume of transactions, the amount of claims receivable at September 30, 2007, should have been $74.4 million. In previous years, SEC made adjustments to reflect the actual volume of transactions; however, SEC does not have written procedures to help ensure that this adjustment is made as a routine part of its year-end financial reporting process. We proposed, and SEC posted, the necessary audit adjustment to correct the amount of transaction fee revenue for fiscal year 2007. Statement on Auditing Standards No.1, Codification of Auditing Standards and Procedures, which explains the accounting requirements for subsequent events, requires that events or transactions that existed at the date of the balance sheet and affect the estimates inherent in the process of preparing financial statements should be considered for adjustment to or disclosure in the financial statements through the date that the financial statements are issued. In addition, the concept of consistency in financial reporting provides that accounting methods, including those for determining estimates, once adopted, should be used consistently from period to period unless there is good cause to change. In our review of SEC’s year-end draft financial statement disclosures, we noted numerous errors including misstated amounts, improper break out of line items, and amounts from fiscal year-end 2006 incorrectly brought forward as beginning balances for fiscal year 2007. For example, in its disclosure for Custodial Revenues and Liabilities, SEC improperly excluded approximately $320 million in collections. In another example, for its disclosure on Fund Balance with Treasury, SEC misclassified approximately $90 million into incorrect line items. Also, in its disclosure for Fiduciary Assets and Liabilities, SEC’s beginning balances for Fund Balance with Treasury and for Liability for Fiduciary Activity were each misstated by $8.9 million due to errors in carrying forward ending balances from September 30, 2006. SEC revised the financial statement disclosures to correct the errors that we noted. We believe the cause of these and numerous other errors in the disclosures is due mainly to the lack of a documented timeline and process for completing the fiscal year 2007 financial statements and disclosures, including review of the disclosures. In addition, the cumbersome and complicated nature of SEC’s financial reporting process discussed above did not allow SEC finance staff sufficient time to carry out thorough and complete reviews of the disclosures in light of the November 15 reporting deadline. We also identified three control deficiencies that adversely affect SEC’s ability to meet its internal control objectives. These conditions concern deficiencies in controls over (1) information security, (2) property and equipment, and (3) accounting for budgetary resources, which are summarized below. SEC relies extensively on computerized information systems to process, account for, and report on its financial activities and make payments. To provide reasonable assurance that financial information and financial assets are adequately safeguarded from inadvertent or deliberate misuse, fraudulent use, improper disclosure, or destruction, effective information security controls are essential. These controls include security management, access controls, configuration management, physical security, and contingency planning. Weaknesses in these controls can impair the accuracy, completeness, and timeliness of information used by management and increase the potential for undetected material misstatements in the agency’s financial statements. During fiscal year 2007, SEC made important progress in mitigating certain control weaknesses that were previously reported as unresolved at the time of our prior review. For example, SEC developed a comprehensive program for monitoring access activities to its computer network environment, tested and evaluated the effectiveness of controls for the general ledger system, and documented authorizations for software modifications. SEC also took corrective action to restrict access to sensitive files on its servers, change default database accounts that had known or weak passwords, and apply strong encryption key management practices for managing secure connections. Despite this progress, SEC has not consistently implemented certain key information security controls to effectively safeguard the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of its financial and sensitive information and information systems. During this year’s audit, we identified continuing and new information security weaknesses that increase the risk that (1) computer resources (programs and data) will not be adequately protected from unauthorized disclosure, modification, and destruction; (2) access to facilities by unauthorized individuals will not be adequately controlled; and (3) computer resources will not be adequately protected and controlled to ensure the continuity of data processing operations when unexpected interruptions occur. For example, SEC had not yet mitigated weaknesses related to malicious code attacks on SEC’s workstations, had not yet adequately documented access privileges for a major application, and had not yet implemented an effective intrusion detection system. New control weaknesses in authorization, boundary protection, configuration management, and audit and monitoring that we identified this year include for example, the use of a single, shared user account for posting journal vouchers in a financial application, inadequate patching of enterprise databases, and inadequate auditing and monitoring capabilities on its database servers. Lapses in physical security enabled unauthorized network access from a publicly accessible location within SEC Headquarters. In addition, SEC did not have contingency plans for key desktops that support manual processes such as the preparation of spreadsheets. These weaknesses existed, in part, because SEC has not yet fully implemented its information security program. Collectively, these problems represent a significant deficiency in SEC’s internal control over information systems and data. Specifically, the continuing and newly identified weaknesses decreased assurances regarding the reliability of the data processed by the systems and increased the risk that unauthorized individuals could gain access to critical hardware and software and intentionally or inadvertently access, alter, or delete sensitive data or computer programs. Until SEC consistently implements all key elements of its information security program, the information that is processed, stored, and transmitted on its systems will remain vulnerable, and management will not have sufficient assurance that financial information and financial assets are adequately safeguarded from inadvertent or deliberate misuse, fraudulent use, improper disclosure, or destruction. We will be issuing a separate report on issues we identified regarding information security concerns at SEC. SEC’s property and equipment consists of general-purpose equipment used by the agency; capital improvements made to buildings leased by SEC for office space; and internal-use software development costs for projects in development and production. SEC acquired approximately $27 million dollars in property and equipment during fiscal year 2007. Similar to our last year’s audit, during the course of testing fiscal year 2007 additions, we noted numerous instances of inaccuracies in recorded acquisition costs and dates for property and equipment purchases, as well as unrecorded property and equipment purchases, and errors in amounts capitalized and amortized for internal-use software projects. In addition, errors were carried forward from the previous year. These systemic errors did not materially affect the balances reported for property and equipment or the corresponding depreciation/amortization expense amounts in SEC’s financial statements for fiscal year 2007; however, these conditions evidence a significant deficiency in control over the recording of property and equipment that affects the reliability of its recorded balances for property and equipment. Specifically, SEC lacks a process that integrates controls over capitalizing and recording property and equipment purchases. For example, SEC does not have a formalized, documented process for comparing quantity and type of item received against the corresponding order for property purchases. In addition, SEC does not have sufficient oversight of the recording of acquisition dates and values of the capitalized property. Further, SEC’s lack of an integrated financial management system for accounting for property and equipment, as discussed above, requires compensating procedures, which were not effective, to ensure that manual calculations, such as those for depreciation and amortization, are accurate. Until it has a systemic process that incorporates effective controls over receiving, recording, capitalizing, and amortizing property and equipment purchases, SEC will not have sufficient assurance over the accuracy and completeness of its reported balances for property and equipment. For fiscal year 2007, SEC incurred $877 million in obligations, which represents legal liabilities against funds available to SEC to pay for goods and services ordered. At September 30, 2007, SEC reported that the amount of budgetary resources obligated for undelivered orders was $255 million, which reflects obligations for goods or services that had not been delivered or received as of that date. In our testing of undelivered order transactions for this year’s audit, we identified several concerns over SEC’s accounting for obligations and undelivered orders. Specifically, we found numerous instances in which SEC (1) recorded obligations prior to having documentary evidence of a binding agreement for the goods or services, (2) recorded invalid undelivered order transactions due to an incorrect posting configuration in SEC’s general ledger, and (3) made errors in recording new obligations and deobligations due to the use of incorrect accounts and by posting incorrect amounts in the general ledger. The majority of exceptions related to these issues, amounting to approximately $76 million, were corrected by SEC through adjusting journal entries. While the remaining uncorrected amounts did not materially affect the balances on the Statement of Budgetary Resources at September 30, 2007, ineffective processes that caused these errors constitute a significant deficiency in SEC’s internal control over recording and reporting of obligations, and puts SEC at risk that the amounts recorded in the general ledger and reported on SEC’s Statement of Budgetary Resources are misstated. Specifically, SEC’s general ledger is not configured to properly post related entries, thereby resulting in the need to routinely correct entries. Extensive reviews of the budgetary transactions, along with significant adjusting journal entries, are needed to compensate for the system limitations. The errors in recording new obligations and deobligations that we found in our audit indicate a lack of effective review over those transactions. Further, SEC does not have policies or internal controls to prevent recording of obligations that are not valid. Recording obligations prior to having documentary evidence of a binding agreement for the goods and services is a violation of the recording statute, and may result in funds being reserved unnecessarily and therefore made unavailable for other uses should the agreement not materialize. In addition, early recording of obligations may result in charging incorrect fiscal year funds for an agreement executed in a later fiscal year. Our tests for compliance with selected provisions of laws and regulations disclosed no instances of noncompliance that would be reportable under U.S. generally accepted government auditing standards or OMB audit guidance. However, the objective of our audit was not to provide an opinion on overall compliance with laws and regulations. Accordingly, we do not express such an opinion. SEC’s Management’s Discussion and Analysis and other accompanying information contain a wide range of data, some of which are not directly related to the financial statements. We do not express an opinion on this information. However, we compared this information for consistency with the financial statements and discussed the methods of measurement and presentation with SEC officials. Based on this limited work, we found no material inconsistencies with the financial statements or nonconformance with OMB guidance. However, because of the internal control weaknesses noted above, misstatements may occur in related performance information. SEC management is responsible for (1) preparing the financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles; (2) establishing, maintaining, and assessing internal control to provide reasonable assurance that the broad control objectives of FMFIA are met; and (3) complying with applicable laws and regulations. We are responsible for obtaining reasonable assurance about whether (1) the financial statements are presented fairly, in all material respects, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles; and (2) management maintained effective internal control, the objectives of which are the following: Financial reporting: Transactions are properly recorded, processed, and summarized to permit the timely and reliable preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, and assets are safeguarded against loss from unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition. Compliance with applicable laws and regulations: Transactions are executed in accordance with (1) laws governing the use of budgetary authority, (2) other laws and regulations that could have a direct and material effect on the financial statements, and (3) any other laws, regulations, or governmentwide policies identified by OMB audit guidance. We are also responsible for (1) testing compliance with selected provisions of laws and regulations that could have a direct and material effect on the financial statements and for which OMB audit guidance requires testing and (2) performing limited procedures with respect to certain other information appearing in SEC’s Performance and Accountability Report. In order to fulfill these responsibilities, we examined, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements; assessed the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by evaluated the overall presentation of the financial statements; obtained an understanding of SEC and its operations, including its internal control related to financial reporting (including safeguarding of assets) and compliance with laws and regulations (including execution of transactions in accordance with budget authority); obtained an understanding of the design of internal controls related to the existence and completeness assertions relating to performance measures as reported in Management’s Discussion and Analysis, and determined whether the internal controls have been placed in operation; tested relevant internal controls over financial reporting and compliance with applicable laws and regulations, and evaluated the design and operating effectiveness of internal control; considered SEC’s process for evaluating and reporting on internal control and financial management systems under the FMFIA; and tested compliance with selected provisions of the following laws and their related regulations: the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended; the Securities Act of 1933, as amended; the Antideficiency Act; laws governing the pay and allowance system for SEC employees; the Prompt Payment Act; and the Federal Employees’ Retirement System Act of 1986. We did not evaluate all internal controls relevant to operating objectives as broadly defined by the FMFIA, such as those controls relevant to preparing statistical reports and ensuring efficient operations. We limited our internal control testing to controls over financial reporting and compliance. Because of inherent limitations in internal control, misstatements due to error or fraud, losses, or noncompliance may nevertheless occur and not be detected. We also caution that projecting our evaluation to future periods is subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with controls may deteriorate. We did not test compliance with all laws and regulations applicable to SEC. We limited our tests of compliance to those required by OMB audit guidance and other laws and regulations that had a direct and material effect on, or that we deemed applicable to, SEC’s financial statements for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2007. We caution that noncompliance may occur and not be detected by these tests and that this testing may not be sufficient for other purposes. We performed our work in accordance with U.S. generally accepted government auditing standards and OMB audit guidance. SEC’s management provided comments on a draft of this report. They are discussed and evaluated below and are reprinted in appendix III. In commenting on a draft of this report, SEC’s Chairman said he was pleased to receive an unqualified opinion on SEC’s financial statements. The Chairman discussed SEC’s plans to remediate this material weakness before the end of fiscal 2008, and to address each of the findings and recommendations identified during the audit. The Chairman emphasized SEC’s commitment to enhance its controls in all operational areas and to ensure reliability of financial reporting, soundness of operations, and public confidence in SEC’s mission. The complete text of SEC’s comments is reprinted in appendix III.","Established in 1934 to enforce the securities laws and protect investors, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) plays an important role in maintaining the integrity of the U.S. securities markets. Pursuant to the Accountability of Tax Dollars Act of 2002, SEC is required to prepare and submit to Congress and the Office of Management and Budget audited financial statements. GAO agreed, under its audit authority, to perform the audit of SEC's financial statements. GAO's audit was done to determine whether, in all material respects, (1) SEC's fiscal year 2007 financial statements were reliable and (2) SEC's management maintained effective internal control over financial reporting and compliance with laws and regulations. GAO also tested SEC's compliance with certain laws and regulations. In GAO's opinion, SEC's fiscal year 2007 and 2006 financial statements were fairly presented in all material respects. However, because of a material weakness in internal control over SEC's financial reporting process, in GAO's opinion, SEC did not have effective internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2007. Recommendations for corrective action will be included in a separate report. Although certain compliance controls should be improved, SEC did maintain in all material respects effective internal control over compliance with laws and regulations material in relation to the financial statements as of September 30, 2007. In addition, GAO did not find reportable instances of noncompliance with the laws and regulations it tested. In its 2006 report, GAO reported on weaknesses in the areas of SEC's (1) recording and reporting of disgorgements and penalties, (2) information systems controls, and (3) property and equipment controls. During fiscal year 2007, SEC improved its controls over the accuracy, timeliness, and completeness of the disgorgement and penalty data and used a much improved database for the initial recording and tracking of these data. However, the processing of these data for financial reporting purposes is still done through a manual process that is prone to error. GAO found that the internal controls that compensated for the manual processing of the related accounts receivable balances in fiscal year 2006 were not effective in fiscal year 2007. This issue is included in the material weakness in SEC's financial reporting process for fiscal year 2007. Other control deficiencies included in this material weakness concern SEC's period-end closing process, accounting for transaction fee revenue, and preparation of financial statement disclosures. GAO also identified three significant deficiencies in internal control during fiscal year 2007. Although SEC has taken steps to strengthen its information security, some of the weaknesses identified in GAO's previous audit persisted and GAO found new weaknesses during this year's audit. Therefore, GAO is reporting information security as a significant deficiency as of September 30, 2007. In addition, GAO continued to identify the same weaknesses in controls over property and equipment and therefore considers this area a significant deficiency as of September 30, 2007. GAO also identified a new significant deficiency concerning SEC's accounting for budgetary transactions. In commenting on a draft of this report, SEC's Chairman emphasized SEC's commitment to enhance its controls in all operational areas and to ensure reliability of financial reporting, soundness of operations, and public confidence in SEC's mission.",govreport
"The Comanche program was established in 1983 to replace the Army’s light helicopter fleet. The contractor team of Sikorsky Aircraft Corporation and Boeing Helicopter Company were expected to design a low-cost, lightweight, advanced technology helicopter capable of performing the primary missions of armed reconnaissance and attack. Critical to achieving these capabilities are the successful development of advanced technologies, including composite materials, advanced avionics and propulsion systems, and sophisticated software and hardware. The Army must meet ambitious maintainability goals in order to (1) realize significantly lower operating and support costs predicted for this program and (2) achieve a wartime operational availability for the Comanche of 6 hours per day. In December 1994, the Secretary of Defense directed the Army to restructure the Comanche helicopter program as part of efforts to meet budgetary constraints. The Secretary’s restructure decision reduced funding for the program from $4.2 billion to $2.2 billion for fiscal years 1996 through 2001. In addition to extending the development phase by 3 years, it also called for two flyable prototypes to be produced and the Comanche production decision to be deferred. In response to the Secretary’s decision, the Army proposed a program restructure that would allow it to acquire, within the Secretary’s funding constraint, six aircraft in addition to the two prototypes by deferring developmental efforts to fiscal year 2002 and beyond. DOD approved the proposal in March 1995. The Army’s restructuring of the Comanche program continues risks (1) associated with making production decisions before knowing whether the aircraft will be able to perform as required and (2) of higher program costs. According to DOD’s April 1990 guidelines for determining degrees of concurrency, a program with high concurrency typically proceeds into low-rate initial production before significant initial operational test and evaluation is completed. Regarding the need to keep concurrency low, the guidelines note that establishing programs with no concurrency, or a low degree of concurrency, avoids the risks that (1) production items have to be retrofitted to make them work properly and (2) system design will not be thoroughly tested. As we recently reported, aircraft systems, including the T-45A and C-17, that entered low-rate initial production before successfully completing initial operational testing and evaluation experienced significant and sometimes costly modifications to achieve satisfactory performance. Under the Army’s restructured program, operational testing will not begin until after the low-rate initial production decision is made, continuing the risks associated with the highly concurrent Comanche program. In responding to the Secretary’s restructure decision, the Army proposed, and was subsequently granted approval, to buy six “early operational capability” aircraft, in addition to the two prototypes that were to be acquired under the Secretary’s decision. According to program officials, these aircraft are estimated to cost in excess of $300 million. The Army does not consider these aircraft as either prototype or low-rate initial production aircraft; however, program officials believe that when these aircraft are fielded, the Army will be able to better evaluate the Comanche’s mission capability. The Army intends to fund these aircraft by deferring additional developmental efforts to fiscal years 2002 and beyond. Under the Army’s restructured program, operational testing will not begin until well after funds are committed to buy production aircraft. Armed reconnaissance and attack mission equipment packages are to be integrated into the six early operational aircraft by fiscal year 2004. The Army plans to use these aircraft to start operational testing by about August 2005. However, long-lead production decisions are scheduled for November 2003, and low-rate initial production is planned to start in November 2004, about 9 months before operational testing begins. According to DOD’s guidelines, the amount of risk associated with concurrency can be limited by reducing production aircraft to the minimum necessary to perform initial operational testing. The Army maintains that under the stretched out program it can conduct initial operational testing with the six early operational aircraft. Because the restructure has provided the additional time and aircraft, the Army has an opportunity to significantly reduce or eliminate program concurrency and its associated risks by completing operational testing before committing funds to any production decisions. The Comanche was originally justified to the Congress as a relatively inexpensive aircraft. However, since 1985, the program has experienced significant increases in program acquisition unit cost. Funding reductions have caused the program to undergo significant restructuring, resulting in sharp decreases in planned acquisition quantities and lengthening of development schedules, thereby increasing Comanche program costs. In 1985, the Comanche had estimated total program acquisition costs of about $61 billion for 5,023 aircraft (or $12.1 million per aircraft). In 1992, we reported that (1) as of October 1991, the program acquisition unit cost had increased to $27.4 million, (2) acquisition quantities had been reduced to 1,292 aircraft, and (3) future increases in cost per aircraft were likely.As of February 1995, the Comanche’s estimated program acquisition unit cost was $34.4 million per aircraft, a 185-percent increase from the 1985 estimate. The estimated total program acquisition cost for the planned acquisition of 1,292 aircraft is now more than $44 billion. Both the Secretary’s decision and the Army’s restructure would extend the development program by about 3 years and, under either, increase the risk of higher total program cost and cost per aircraft. However, in reviewing the Army’s restructure proposal, DOD noted some concern over Comanche program costs for fiscal year 2002 and beyond and the large increase in investment programs projected to occur about that time. We are also concerned that the Army’s plan to defer additional developmental efforts to fiscal year 2002 and beyond may increase the risk that needed funds may not be available to perform the deferred developmental effort. The Comanche program’s uncertainties in software development and aircraft maintainability increase the risk that the aircraft will not perform successfully. We believe the restructuring provides additional time to resolve these issues before the decision to enter production is made. The Comanche will be the most computerized, software-intensive Army helicopter ever built. The Army estimates that about 1.4 million lines of code are required to perform and integrate mission critical functions. With additional ground support and training software to be developed, the total program will have more than 2.7 million lines of code. This compares to about 573,000 lines of code for the upgraded Apache attack helicopter with fire control radar. The Army estimates 95 percent of the Comanche’s total software will be written in Ada, a DOD-developed programming language. The Army plans to demonstrate initial software performance with the mission equipment package, which includes the flight control system, during first flight of the Comanche, scheduled for November 1995. The development and integration of on-board, embedded computer systems is a significant program objective. The Comanche’s performance and capability depend heavily on these systems and efforts have been ongoing to solve the problems associated with these systems. Nevertheless, (1) software development problems still exist with the Ada compilation system, (2) delays in software development and testing are occurring, and (3) improvements are needed in configuration management. If these issues are not resolved, the aircraft’s performance and capability will be degraded and first flight could be delayed. Almost all of the Comanche software will be developed in the Ada programming language; however, software developers are not using the same version of the Ada compilation system. The Ada compilation system translates Ada code into machine language so that software can be used by the Comanche’s computers. For example, it is being used to help develop software for use on the mission equipment package that is critical for first flight. Subcontractors and the contractor team should be using the same, qualified version of this compilation system to ensure effective software integration. However, fixes to individual compiler software problems are not being shared with all developers; therefore, they are not using a common compilation system. These problems have already delayed qualification testing of the compilation system by 1 year. The lack of a uniform, qualified compilation system among software developers could put first flight at risk, according to the Defense Plant Representative Office. Problems with software integration may show up once integration testing begins in the June to November 1995 time frame. If that occurs, there may not be time to fix problems prior to scheduled first flight. The program is experiencing high turnover of software engineers at one of the contractor team’s facilities. In its December 1994, monthly assessment report, the Defense Plant Representative Office, which is responsible for contract oversight, observed that high turnover of software personnel was putting scheduled first flight at risk. Loss of key personnel has already contributed to schedule slippage in several critical software development areas. Software development for the following areas has been affected: the airborne engine monitoring system, aircraft systems management, control database, and crewstation interface management. The contractor team has formulated a “get well” plan that is dependent on being able to hire additional personnel in these areas. However, hiring additional qualified personnel is difficult, according to the Defense Plant Representative Office, because employment would be short term. The flight control system software verification testing is also being delayed. As of February 8, 1995, Boeing had conducted only 163 of approximately 500 tests originally planned to be completed by that date. The subcontractor responsible for developing this software has been late delivering software for testing and has provided faulty software to Boeing, according to the Defense Plant Representative Office. Boeing established a recovery plan for this area that would have resulted in a completion date in March 1995—about a 1-month delay from the original plan. However, in February 1995, the contractor revised the recovery plan to reflect a completion date of July 1995—a 5-month delay. The flight control system is critical to first flight, according to the Defense Plant Representative Office. However, because of delays with verification testing, the Defense Plant Representative Office is concerned that the remaining verification testing, as well as, the validation and formal qualification testing will not be completed in a timely manner. As a result, first flight may be delayed. Boeing is scheduled to complete these tests prior to first flight. According to the program office, Boeing’s plan to complete the testing calls for it to be conducted concurrently. If major problems occur in any one of the testing phases, there may not be enough time to fix the problem and complete all testing before first flight. Configuration management is the discipline of applying technical and administrative direction and surveillance to (a) control the flow of information between organizations and activities within a project; (b) manage the ownership of, and changes to, controlled information; (c) ensure information consistency; and (d) enable product release, acceptance, and maintenance. The part of configuration management used to report software problems and changes among the contractor team and subcontractors has shortcomings that put software development at risk. In its November 1994 monthly assessment report, the Defense Plant Representative Office observed that the lack of a common problem reporting system made proper handling of software related changes difficult. Furthermore, the report noted that this situation could adversely impact scheduled first flight of the Comanche. As of February 1995, the contractor team still did not have a common, automated database available to track problem change reports. Thus, the contractor team, as well as subcontractors, did not have visibility over changes made to software. Maintainability requirements are important to achieving lower operating and support costs and wartime availability goals. However, these goals are at risk because key maintainability requirements such as direct maintenance man-hours per flight hour (MMH/FH), the mean time to repair (MTTR), and fault isolation may not be achievable. Individually, failure to meet these parameters may not be a significant problem; however, collectively they affect the ability of the Comanche to achieve lower operating and support cost and wartime availability objectives. In March 1987, the Army established a 2.6 direct MMH/FH requirement for the Comanche. It represents the corrective and preventive maintenance per flight hour expected to be performed at the unit level. The Army formulated its planned wartime operating tempo for a Comanche battalion based on 6 hours a day per aircraft, or 2,200 flying hours per year. It then determined the maintenance factor needed to support this operating tempo—2.6 MMH/FH. As the MMH/FH level increases, the number of maintainers needed to sustain the 2,200 wartime flying hour goal increases, as do operating and support costs. Conversely, if the Army could not increase the number of maintainers, the planned operating tempo would have to be reduced. The reasonableness of the Comanche’s 2.6 direct MMH/FH requirement has been debated for several years within the Army and DOD. Representatives from the program office; the Army Materiel Systems Analysis Activity, which independently evaluates program testing results; the Office of the Assistant Secretary of the Army for Research, Development, and Acquisition; and the Army Cost and Economic Analysis Center met on October 28, 1994, to discuss the direct MMH/FH goal for the Comanche program. They agreed that the 2.6-MMH/FH requirement was not a realistic, achievable goal. Consequently, Army officials reached consensus and agreed on 3.2 direct MMH/FH as the Army-wide position for this parameter. However, during these discussions, Army Materiel Systems Analysis Activity personnel noted that attaining a 3.2-MMH/FH goal represented a medium to high risk, while a 4.3-MMH/FH goal had a low to medium risk. Increasing the maintenance factor increased the number of maintainers needed and will increase estimated operating and support costs by about $800 million over a 20-year period. The direct MMH/FH requirement does not represent the total maintenance burden for the Comanche because it does not include indirect maintenance time. The Army does not normally collect data on indirect maintenance time. According to the program office, its best estimate of indirect maintenance time, following Army guidance, is 2.5 MMH/FH, and this figure has been used for calculating manpower needs for crew chief personnel on the Comanche. Thus, the total maintenance burden assumed for the Comanche is currently 5.7 MMH/FH (3.2 direct MMH/FH plus 2.5 indirect MMH/FH). To minimize turnaround time for repairs at the unit and depot, the Army established MTTR requirements of 52 minutes for repairs at the unit level and up to 12 hours at the depot level for the Comanche. These requirements represents the average time expected to diagnose a fault, remove and repair an item, and perform an operational check and/or test flight. We determined that any increase in MTTR above 1 hour will begin to impact the Army’s wartime availability goal of 2,200 hours per year, unless additional maintenance personnel are available. As of January 1995, the contractor team was estimating that the Army would achieve 59 minutes for unit level repairs. According to contractor team officials, the requirement was not being met because the cure time required for composite material used on the aircraft was greater than expected. The contractor team discussed changing the MTTR requirement to 1 hour; however, the program office believes the problem could be resolved and did not believe the specification should be changed. The contractor team has not yet developed MTTR estimates for depot-level repair. The Comanche’s diagnostic system is required to correctly isolate failed mechanical and electrical components at least 80 percent of the time with a high degree of accuracy. A high level of accuracy is essential as it allows maintainers to isolate and fix problems at the unit level. If the fault isolation requirement is not met, the Comanche is unlikely to achieve its MTTR requirement, thereby adversely affecting the Army’s ability to execute its maintenance concept and its wartime availability goals. Contractor team officials stated the fault isolation requirement was very optimistic, and although they are striving to meet this requirement, it may eventually have to be changed. As of January 1995, the contractor team predicted the system could achieve an overall 69-percent fault isolation rate; however, this rate would not meet the specification for mechanical and electrical component fault isolation. There are design limitations on two components, according to the program office, and changes to bring these components into conformance with specifications would be costly and increase the weight of the aircraft. Therefore, as of January 1995, the contractor team and the program office have agreed not to take action on these components. The Army established a requirement of a 1-percent false removal rate for the Comanche. A false removal occurs when a part removed from the aircraft shows no evidence of failure when tested. This requirement is dependent, to a large extent, on the success of the fault detection/isolation system in detecting and isolating failed components. Program personnel characterize the 1-percent requirement as stringent and one that will be challenging to achieve. An Army Materiel Systems Analysis Activity official believes some design improvements have occurred in this area, but the risk associated with achieving this requirement still remains high. If the Comanche does not meet this requirement, estimated operating and support costs for the Comanche will be higher than previously predicted. The Army has not had good experience in developing fault detection/isolation and false removal systems for other aircraft. In September 1990, we reported that the fault detection and isolation system on the Apache aircraft did not always accurately detect the component that caused a particular fault, and the system detected faults that did not actually exist about 40 percent of the time. As a result, Apache maintainers had to perform additional work to locate failed components. Recently, through a reliability program, the false removal rate for the targeting and night vision systems on the Apache improved to about 10 to 15 percent, according to Army officials. This is still significantly higher than the 1-percent requirement established for the Comanche program. Although the program is experiencing technical problems, it is currently meeting its goals of reducing maintenance levels and keeping overall weight growth within acceptable limits for the Comanche. The Army’s maintenance concept for the Comanche program is predicated on two levels of maintenance—unit- and depot-level maintenance. This concept is important to achieving operating and support savings predicted for the program because it eliminates the intermediate level of maintenance. Unit-level maintenance entails removing and replacing components required to return the aircraft to a serviceable condition. Depot-level maintenance requires higher level maintenance skills and sophisticated capital equipment and facilities not found at the unit level. The Army traditionally uses a three-level maintenance concept that includes intermediate-level maintenance to handle component repairs. Intermediate-level maintenance is usually located close to the battalion. It is performed on components that cannot be easily repaired at the unit level and do not require the more sophisticated repairs done at the depot level. As of January 1995, no Comanche component had been designated for repair at the intermediate level, according to the program office. Contractor team personnel are conducting repair level analysis on Comanche components to determine whether components should be repaired at unit, intermediate, or depot facilities, according to program and contractor team officials. Any candidates identified for intermediate-level repair are reviewed for possible design changes that could allow maintenance at the unit or depot level. If economically feasible, the contractor team will make design changes to the component to preclude the need for intermediate-level repair. As of February 7, 1995, the Comanche’s empty weight increased from its original specification of 7,500 pounds to 7,883 pounds. Although the Comanche’s weight continues to increase, it remains within the allowable design limit of 7,997 pounds. Weight increases affect vertical rate of climb performance on the Comanche. The Army established a limit of 500 feet-per-minute as the minimum acceptable vertical rate of climb performance. If the Comanche’s weight exceeds 8,231 pounds, the engine will have to be redesigned to produce enough power at 95 percent maximum rated engine power to sustain the minimum 500 feet-per-minute vertical rate of climb requirement. We recommend that the Secretary of Defense require the Army to complete operational testing to validate the Comanche’s operational effectiveness and suitability before committing any funds to acquire long-lead production items or enter low-rate initial production. DOD generally concurred with the findings and original recommendations in our draft report. In commenting on the draft report, DOD offered explanations about why the problems that we identified were occurring and what they were doing to fix those problems. DOD disagreed with the report’s conclusion about false removals and stated that we had not presented any evidence that the Comanche’s 1-percent false removal rate may not be achievable. We still believe that the false removal goal is high risk and adjusted the report to more clearly reflect our concern. Regarding our draft report recommendation that DOD develop program fixes that achieve program goals and reduce the risks we identified, DOD concurred and noted that the approved restructuring will significantly reduce risk. DOD concurred with our other draft recommendation not to commit production funds to the program until performance and mission requirements are met and noted that the program would be reviewed by DOD before approving the Army’s request to proceed to the engineering and manufacturing development phase—the Milestone II decision scheduled for October 2001. Because DOD concurred in our draft report recommendations and is taking action on them, we are no longer including them in this report. However, our analysis of information on the restructuring obtained after we had submitted our draft report to DOD has further heightened our concerns about the risk of concurrency; therefore, we have revised the report and added a new recommendation. Under the stretched out, restructured Comanche program, operational testing is not even scheduled to begin until after the low-rate initial production decision is made. This approach continues the risks associated with making production decisions before knowing whether the aircraft will be able to perform as required. Prior to the restructure, the Army planned to start operational testing with eight aircraft in May 2003. Under the restructured program, the Army plans to start operational testing with six helicopters by about August 2005. We believe that the stretched out time frame and the six aircraft acquired under the restructure provide sufficient time and aircraft to operationally test the Comanche prior to making any production decisions. Additionally, because operational testing is not scheduled until about August 2005, DOD will not be in a position at Milestone II in October 2001 to adequately address whether the Comanche program is meeting its performance requirements. DOD’s comments are presented in their entirety in appendix I, along with our evaluation. To assess cost changes, software development, maintainability, and weight growth issues, we reviewed program documents and interviewed officials from the Department of the Army headquarters, Washington, D.C.; the Comanche Program Manager’s Office, St. Louis, Missouri; the U.S. Army Materiel Systems Analysis Activity, Aberdeen Proving Ground, Maryland; the Ada Validation Facility, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio; and the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Program Analysis and Evaluation, Washington, D.C. We also reviewed program documents and interviewed contractor and Defense Plant Representative Office officials at the Boeing Helicopter Company, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; the Sikorsky Aircraft Corporation, Stratford, Connecticut; and the Comanche Joint Program Office, Trumbull, Connecticut. We conducted our review between August 1994 and February 1995 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. We are also sending copies of this report to the Chairmen and Ranking Minority Members of the Senate and House Committees on Appropriations, the Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs, and the House Committee on Government Reform and Oversight; the Director, Office of Management and Budget; and the Secretaries of Defense and the Army. We will also provide copies to others upon request. This report was prepared under the direction of Thomas J. Schulz, Associate Director, Systems Development and Production Issues. Please contact Mr. Schulz at (202) 512-4841 if you or your staff have any questions concerning this report. Other major contributors to this report are listed in appendix II. The following are GAO’s comments on the Department of Defense’s (DOD) letter dated April 20, 1995. 1. As DOD’s comments note, there are many measures of unit cost, such as average unit flyaway cost, program acquisition unit cost, and unit procurement cost. We believe that the program unit cost that we used in the report—which the footnote in the report defines as total research, development, and acquisition costs in current dollars—is as valid as flyaway cost to portray program cost growth over time. We have adjusted the report to more clearly define the basis of the unit cost we use. 2. These comments are dealt with on pages 11 and 12 of the report and in our responses to the specific DOD comments that follow. Report material on costs and concurrency has been revised to reflect information obtained after our fieldwork had been concluded. 3. The report does not say that maintainability goals will never be met. We pointed out that some key maintainability requirements are not being met and, therefore, there is a risk that the Army may not achieve the lower operating and support costs and wartime availability goals that it has established for this program. We also said that individually, failure to meet these parameters may not be a significant problem; however, collectively they affect the ability of the Comanche to achieve the cost and availability goals. This point is clearly illustrated in DOD’s comments on the failure of the fault isolation system. According to DOD, “Fault isolation is one of the key diagnostic system requirements. The DOD agrees that if the fault isolation requirement is not met, the Comanche is unlikely to achieve its mean-time-to-repair requirement, . . .”. 4. We still believe that this goal is very aggressive. DOD acknowledges that this goal is stringent and the Army has not had good experience in the past with false removals on other aircraft. Additionally, as noted in the report, Army Materiel Systems Analysis Activity said the risk associated with achieving this requirement remains high. We changed the section heading to emphasize the high risk. Gary L. Billen Robert D. Spence Lauri A. Bischof Michael W. Buell Karen A. Rieger The first copy of each GAO report and testimony is free.

"Supply Chain Integration, an office under the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Logistics & Materiel Readiness, Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics, is the department- wide office responsible for leading the development of DOD supply chain policies as well as improving accountability, visibility, and control of all critical assets, including SRC I ammunition. In addition, the Army has a prominent role in managing SRC I ammunition, as the Army procures a majority of the department’s ammunition and provides wholesale storage for the other military services at Army depots. The Army depots ship SRC I ammunition owned by the other military services to their respective locations at their request. Also, Army depots conduct semiannual physical inventories of all SRC I ammunition as required of all installations storing SRC I ammunition. SRC I ammunition may also be located—generally in small quantities—at retail locations, such as military service installations, bases, and ammunition supply points. Each military service has entities responsible for the accountability, physical inventory, and transportation of SRC I ammunition. According to military service ammunition data, the Army, Navy, Marine Corps, and Air Force collectively had approximately 226,000 SRC I missiles and rockets in the continental United States, as of April 30, 2015, as shown in table 1. In addition, USTRANSCOM is designated by DOD Directive as the DOD’s single manager for transportation, other than Service-unique or theater- assigned assets and as the DOD Distribution Process Owner. This designation includes transportation of SRC I ammunition. The Military Surface Deployment and Distribution Command, which falls under USTRANSCOM, tracks the movement of SRC I ammunition. Additionally, according to DOD officials, the Military Surface Deployment and Distribution Command coordinates responses to transportation issues of SRC I ammunition while in transit. Table 2 shows key stakeholders and roles in the transportation of SRC I ammunition. DODM 5100.76, Physical Security of Sensitive Conventional Arms, Ammunition, and Explosives (AA&E) sets forth DOD policy on the physical security of sensitive conventional AA&E. According to DODM 5100.76, continuous program and policy oversight is required to ensure protection of AA&E within DOD, and DOD components are required to track and conduct physical inventories of SRC I ammunition by serial number. Further, DOD policy requires SRC I ammunition to have a higher level of protection and security than that provided for SRC II through SRC IV conventional ammunition. DOD and the military services have policy and guidance on how to account for, safeguard, conduct physical inventories, adjust if necessary, track, and ship SRC I ammunition within and between services and to contractors for repair. Appendix III provides additional detail on DOD policy and military service guidance relevant to the management of SRC I ammunition. The military services have several automated information systems for managing accountability and visibility of SRC I ammunition. These automated information systems also maintain various item-specific data such as serial number, production lot number, DOD identification codes, serviceability, reporting location, ownership, quantity, and shipment information. Figure 1 shows the automated information systems. The department is in the final stages of evaluating various automated information systems, including NLAC, to be designated as the DOD-wide authoritative source of data for conventional ammunition, including SRC I ammunition. DOD’s evaluation to select one authoritative information system for conventional ammunition comes in response to our March 2014 recommendation that the department designate an authoritative source of data on conventional ammunition, which includes SRC I ammunition. Also, the evaluation is in response to a congressional mandate to issue department-wide guidance by September 2015 to designate an authoritative source of data for conventional ammunition. According to OSD officials, the to-be-designated visibility system will serve as a repository of ammunition data collected through regular data feeds from the military services’ automated information systems. Since 1994, we have issued several reports about the management of SRC I ammunition, focusing on serial-number registration, physical inventories, and transportation issues. In 1994, we found that while the Navy and the Marine Corps began controlling missiles by serial number in 1990 and 1992, respectively, the Army was working on obtaining control of SRC I missiles by serial number. Further, we found that the military services were not regularly conducting physical inventories of SRC I missiles and we made recommendations to strengthen inventory accountability, which the department concurred with and implemented. In our September 1997 report, we found the military services had different procedures and requirements for maintaining oversight of SRC I rockets. Specifically, we found that the Marine Corps maintained oversight and visibility of its weapons by serial number, whereas the Army and the Navy managed their SRC I rockets by production lot and quantity. DOD concurred with our recommendation to manage SRC I rockets by serial number and reissued DOD policy in 2000. In our 2000 report, we found internal controls weaknesses at an Army ammunition depot that resulted in a loss of accountability and control over SRC I rockets. For example, serial number control of SRC I rockets was lost at the time of shipment from the contractor because serial numbers listed on receiving reports that accompanied shipments did not correspond to the actual items and quantities of the respective shipments. In March 2014, we reported on DOD’s management of conventional ammunition, and found, among other things, some limitations of the military services’ use of automated information systems that affected their ability to facilitate efficient management of conventional ammunition. We found that NLAC, the department-wide repository of ammunition data, had limitations in providing visibility of ammunition and recommended that the department select an authoritative source of department-wide ammunition data to improve DOD’s ability to provide total asset visibility over conventional ammunition. DOD concurred and stated that it would assess the alternatives and designate the appropriate solution by the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2015. Also, we recommended that DOD identify and implement internal controls, consistent with federal internal control standards, that would provide reasonable assurance that NLAC collects comprehensive, accurate data from other service ammunition systems. DOD concurred and stated in its agency response to our report that the Army updated the performance work statement for NLAC to include analyzing new data sources to identify improved system interfacing that will improve data accuracy, completeness, quality assurance, and auditability. For more details of our findings, recommendations, and the status of actions taken by DOD relating to DOD’s management of SRC I ammunition, see appendix IV. The military services have maintained accountability of SRC I ammunition at 11 sampled locations in the continental United States; however, we identified gaps in some service-level guidance and procedures for how SRC I ammunition is accounted for across locations. We found that the Air Force does not track SRC I ammunition by serial number but has plans to revise its guidance. Also, we found Air Force procedures have not maintained accountability for items owned by other services and stored at Air Force locations. Further, the military services generally recorded shipment and receipt in their accountability systems, but the receipt was not always recorded in a timely manner. Finally, we found that Army processes and information systems do not provide full accountability for in-transit items. We found that the military services have maintained accountability in their automated information systems of SRC I ammunition at the 11 sampled locations we reviewed. DOD policy calls for continuous program and policy oversight to ensure protection of AA&E, to include SRC I ammunition, within DOD. Likewise, military service guidance details accountability of AA&E, including maintenance of records. We found that, for our sample of 616 SRC I ammunition items, 612 of the 616 records matched the military services’ automated information systems and the remaining 4, although not recorded as required, were accounted for by service officials. Additionally, as part of our sample, we observed SRC I ammunition that was being readied for rapid deployment, as shown in figure 2, and documented the serial number and other identifying information, and verified the information in the Army’s systems. Additionally, we found that, in accordance with DOD policy and military service guidance and at required frequencies, the military services conducted physical inventories of SRC I ammunition to ensure accountability at 22 selected military service locations in the continental United States. We analyzed inventory memorandums from all Army depots storing SRC I ammunition, as well as selected military service locations, and found that the physical inventories were recorded as being conducted. Inventory personnel stated there were no delays or challenges in completing the physical inventories of SRC I ammunition because of sequestration or other budgetary concerns. Further, during our review, we identified instances in which the Navy and Army had taken actions to enhance the accountability of their physical inventories. First, we found that the Army, Marine Corps, and Air Force certify completion of the physical inventory of SRC I ammunition through a signed memorandum. According to Navy officials, Navy policy does not require certification through a signed memorandum. Rather, the Navy OIS system captures a Date of Last Inventory; however, Navy officials acknowledged they did not have a business process to use this data point. After we identified this, Navy officials took action to begin developing a business process to identify late inventories. Second, according to Navy officials, in an effort to better align with DOD policy, the Navy revised guidance in April 2015 to align with requirements in DODM 5100.76 so it would reflect specific intervals for completing physical inventories: monthly for unit levels and semiannually for non-unit level. Third, we examined the physical inventory process at a contractor location. We found the contractor had completed physical inventories of SRC I missiles in its custody, although the contract did not specify the frequency or approach for conducting physical inventories. When we asked Army officials to provide documentation from the contractor verifying that physical inventories were completed, the officials acknowledged they do not receive verification from the contractor upon completion of physical inventories, but stated they have taken action and are evaluating methodology to ensure they receive documentation to verify that the contractor has completed physical inventories in the future. We found that the military services, except the Air Force, track SRC I ammunition by serial number in their respective accountability systems, and the Air Force has plans to revise its guidance regarding tracking. The Air Force tracks SRC I ammunition in its accountability system, CAS, by quantities within production lot numbers. CAS does not have the capability to track SRC I ammunition by serial number because CAS does not have a field to enter serial numbers. With this limitation, the Air Force also cannot conduct physical inventories of SRC I ammunition by serial number. We found in September 1997 that the military services did not uniformly track SRC I rockets by serial number and recommended that the services manage SRC I rockets by serial number to have total visibility over the numbers and locations of rockets. The department concurred and reissued policy in 2000 to require DOD components to track and conduct physical inventories of SRC I ammunition by serial number. However, Air Force guidance reissued in June 2015 recognizes that CAS cannot track SRC I ammunition by serial number and will instead track by quantities within production lot numbers. Air Force officials have recognized that they are not meeting DOD requirements for tracking SRC I ammunition by serial number, but are in the process of modernizing CAS to track by serial number. According to Air Force officials, the Air Force previously focused on the development of another enterprise information system to track, among other things, ammunition; however, the Air Force cancelled the system and is now in the process of upgrading CAS. The Air Force provided supporting documentation to confirm plans for CAS modernization by 2017. According to Air Force officials, this upgrade will modernize the system through technological upgrades that also includes provisions to improve auditability of CAS. Upon upgrading CAS to track SRC I ammunition by serial number, Air Force officials plan to reissue Air Force guidance to ensure that the Air Force tracks and conducts physical inventories of SRC I ammunition by serial number. If the Air Force does not modify CAS to include serial numbers, the Air Force will continue to lack serial number traceability of SRC I ammunition and will not meet DOD requirements. By tracking SRC I ammunition by quantities within production lot numbers, the Air Force will not have detailed information to support life-cycle traceability requirements, such as a transactional history including inventory, maintenance, repair, service records and/or supply, for each serial number, which may affect their ability to investigate instances of lost or stolen SRC I ammunition. Air Force policy does not require accountability in its system of record for items owned by other services and stored at Air Force locations. We identified 55 SRC I ammunition items owned by the Army or Marine Corps that were in the physical custody of the Air Force, but the Air Force did not maintain accountability of these items in its system of record— CAS. DOD policy requires that the DOD component that has physical custody of materiel in storage maintain accountability for that materiel in the component’s system of record, regardless of which DOD component owns the materiel. However, we found that Air Force guidance does not require personnel to maintain accountability in its system of record for SRC I ammunition items owned by other services but in the physical custody of the Air Force, and instead allows ammunition owned by other services to be tracked in a “non-accountable” program within CAS. This non-accountable program tracks information such as net explosive weight and asset visibility; however, according to Air Force officials, the non- accountable program does not maintain an audit trail or history that would document receipt and provide a record of how the SRC I ammunition was managed while at the Air Force location. We found that, consistent with DOD policy, Army, Navy, and Marine Corps guidance generally requires that accountability for ammunition in the physical custody of the service be maintained in the service’s system of record, regardless of which service owns the ammunition. Accountability for the 55 SRC I ammunition items we identified that were owned by the Army or Marine Corps that were shipped to and in the physical custody of the Air Force was not maintained in any service’s system of record while at the Air Force location. These items included: 40 Marine Corps-owned SRC I ammunition items that were stored at an Air Force location for approximately 11 months. Marine Corps officials were able to provide evidence that these items were shipped back to a Marine Corps location after the 11 months of storage at the Air Force location. 5 Army-owned AT4 anti-armor weapons that were shipped to an Air Force installation for Army training purposes. According to Air Force officials, these SRC I ammunition items have been expended, but Army and Air Force officials did not provide us related documentation. 10 additional Army-owned AT4 anti-armor weapons that were shipped to an Air Force installation for Army training purposes. For these 10 items, Army information systems show that the items were expended and turned in 2 and a half months after shipment, but Army and Air Force officials did not provide us documentation of accountability for the assets during the time they were in Air Force custody. Air Force officials stated that these ammunition items were managed on the non-accountable program because the ammunition was Marine Corps or Army property of which the Air Force did not intend to take ownership. According to Air Force officials, the assets had been deleted once the items were removed from the munitions storage area. Air Force officials could not provide us key information about these shipments, such as the date the shipments were accepted into the munitions storage area, to whom the ammunition items were issued, or when the ammunition items were issued because they said that information was no longer available in the non-accountable program. Marine Corps and Army officials told us that the ammunition items would likely have been managed by the unit— for example, by using a separate system or a manual process such as a spreadsheet. However, they did not provide a copy of the document that was used. Air Force officials updated guidance in June 2015 to place more restrictions on the use of the non-accountable program, including for SRC I ammunition items, but the guidance continues to allow the use of the non-accountable record when the Air Force does not intend to take ownership of the ammunition. According to Air Force officials, the decision of whether to maintain accountability for ammunition owned by other services in CAS depends on the operational situation and tactical environment. For example, for 20 additional SRC I ammunition items we reviewed that were owned by the Army but in the physical custody of the Air Force for testing purposes, Air Force officials maintained accountability in CAS and were able to provide transaction history. Officials told us that the Air Force is in the process of updating CAS to facilitate tracking of SRC I ammunition by owner and will move toward having most assets in CAS. However, if the Air Force does not revise guidance to clarify that accountability for all SRC I ammunition items in the Air Force’s custody—regardless of ownership—should be maintained in the Air Force’s system of record, both the Air Force and the owning service will lack a record of receipt and management of the SRC I ammunition while at the Air Force location; also the owning service will not have full assurance that accountability was maintained. We found that the military services generally recorded shipment and receipt of SRC I ammunition in their accountability systems; however, we found that existing Army depot and Marine Corps guidance do not specify a time frame for receipting shipments of SRC I ammunition. Marine Corps officials told us they generally adhere to the Navy’s guidance, which requires receipting of shipments within 1 business day, but Marine Corps installations are not required to follow that guidance. DOD policy emphasizes the need for continuous oversight to ensure protection of sensitive conventional arms, ammunition and explosives given that if these items are left vulnerable they have the potential to jeopardize the safety and security of personnel, activities, missions, and installations worldwide. DOD policy delegates to DOD component heads the responsibility to implement the procedures of DODM 5100.76, Physical Security of Sensitive Conventional Arms, Ammunition, and Explosives (AA&E) (Feb. 28, 2014) and develop supplemental guidance for the protection of arms, ammunition, and explosives in accordance with DODI 5100.76 Safeguarding Conventional Arms, Ammunition, and Explosives (AA&E) (May 20, 2010). However, the military services varied in the extent to which they have developed guidance that addresses the time frame within which SRC I ammunition should be receipted on the accountable record. Air Force guidance specifies SRC I ammunition be receipted on the accountable record immediately; Army guidance for retail locations specifies within 24 hours; and Navy guidance specifies within 1 business day. In contrast, Army, at the depot-level, and the Marine Corps have not finalized guidance that addresses the required time frame for receipting SRC I ammunition. In our review, we found that, generally, for those services with guidance, SRC I ammunition was receipted on the accountable record within specified time frames, while the services without guidance were more likely to receipt SRC I ammunition days after arrival, and in some instances, more than 5 days after arrival. In a non-generalizable sample of 104 shipments that we reviewed, we found the record of shipment in the shipper’s accountability system. For 100 of the 104 shipments, we found a corresponding receipt in the receiver’s accountability system. Of the four shipments for which we did not find a corresponding receipt, two were shipments of Army-owned items to the Air Force locations that the Air Force did not maintain in its accountable system because it did not own the items, and other two were shipments of Navy-owned SRC I items to a contractor for inspection. However, we found that approximately 20 percent of shipments of SRC I ammunition in our non-generalizable sample were not receipted within the time frames stated in military service policy or described as standard practice by military service officials. Of the 104 shipments we reviewed, we were able to compare receipt information to arrival time for 99 shipments, and we found that 21 of these 99 shipments were not receipted on the services’ accountability system within 2 business days after the arrival of the shipment. All of the military services either have documented policy that requires receipting SRC I ammunition on the accountable record within 1 business day or less or told us that they generally adhere to that time frame, but in our analysis, we allowed for 2 business days because military services’ information systems may take an additional business day to record transactions. Table 3 provides additional details of receipting time frames for each service. Air Force locations and Army retail locations are required by service guidance to adhere to established time frames for receipting SRC I ammunition, and all shipments we reviewed at Air Force locations for which we located receipts and all but 2 shipments we reviewed at the Army retail locations were receipted on the accountable record within 2 business days, as shown in table 3 above. In contrast, we found that the Army, at the depot-level, and the Marine Corps have not finalized guidance that addresses the required time frame for receipting SRC I ammunition. As identified in table 3, 12 of 21 shipments to Army depots and 5 of 30 shipments to Marine Corps locations were receipted more than 2 business days after arrival. An Army official told us that depots are required to receipt inbound shipments within 24 hours based on a policy letter issued prior to 2010, and that this requirement has also been in draft guidance since 2013, but that the guidance has not yet been finalized. Similarly, the Marine Corps does not have a receipting timeframe for SRC I ammunition in its guidance. Marine Corps officials told us they generally adhere to the Navy’s guidance, which requires receipting of shipments within 1 business day, but Marine Corps installations are not required to follow that guidance. Marine Corps officials told us that as of October 2015 they were in the process of incorporating a required time frame for receipting SRC I ammunition in Marine Corps guidance but did not provide a specific time frame for revising the guidance. Until the Army, at the depot-level, and the Marine Corps finalize and implement guidance that addresses the required time frame for receipting SRC I ammunition, Army and Marine Corps officials will not have the data they need to help assure accountability for all shipped SRC I ammunition. The Air Force and Navy have policies regarding maintaining in-transit accountability for shipped SRC I ammunition that generally adhere to DOD requirements, and the Marine Corps has planned system updates to adhere to requirements; however, the Army’s policy and processes do not fully adhere. DOD policy requires that the DOD component directing materiel into an in-transit status will retain accountability within the logistics records for that materiel until there is a formal acknowledgment of receipt. The Air Force and Navy maintain in-transit tables in their accountability systems that can be used to track ammunition that has been shipped but not yet receipted. Additionally, the Navy requires all in- transit materiel remain accountable to the issuing activity until properly receipted or resolved, and Air Force policy requires that each receiver acknowledge—orally or in writing or through other automated means— that the shipped SRC I items were received, and the date the assets were received. The Marine Corps has planned system updates to adhere to DOD requirements to maintain accountability for in-transit SRC I ammunition items. According to Marine Corps officials, the Marine Corps tracks Marine Corps-owned assets in transit until formal acknowledgement of receipt in its OIS-MC system, but Marine Corps ammunition supply points do not maintain accountability for SRC I ammunition in transit to another service. Marine Corps officials told us that the system of record used by Marine Corps ammunition supply points is being upgraded in fiscal year 2016 to facilitate compliance with in-transit requirements. The Army does not maintain accountability for all in-transit items within the logistics records for that materiel until there is a formal acknowledgement of receipt. Army regulations require the Joint Munitions Command to track shipments of SRC I ammunition from depot to depot, depot to unit, or unit to depot using DTTS and to monitor shipping documents and receipts to ensure they are closed or posted in a timely manner. However, officials from the Joint Munitions Command told us they do not receive confirmation of receipt from some entities, including other military services and some contractors. The Army’s systems do not maintain in-transit tables that show items that have been shipped out of one location and are due in to another. When the Army ships SRC I ammunition from depots or retail locations, it drops those items from its accountable systems without a requirement to confirm or document that the shipment was received. For SRC I ammunition shipments to other Army locations, the Army retains visibility of shipments by maintaining a record of SRC I ammunition items that have been shipped in its Worldwide Ammunition Reporting System-New Technology (WARS-NT) database, and matches up shipped items and receipted items by serial number to confirm that the items were received. However, for shipments to other military services, Army officials told us that the Army clears shipped items from its WARS-NT records upon receiving confirmation that the items were shipped. Army officials told us that limitations in their depot-level system, called LMP, and in their retail-level system, called the Standard Army Ammunition System, prevent them from maintaining full accountability for in-transit items, and that this deficiency, which affects all classes of supply, has been identified by the Army since 2012 at both the depot and retail level but that a solution has not yet been developed because, in part, of technical complexities. However, Army officials have not evaluated or identified actions that the Army could take to enable it to retain accountability for in-transit items until acknowledgment of receipt. Unless the Army evaluates and identifies actions to retain accountability for in-transit items until acknowledgement of receipt, the Army will not have a path forward to ensure that accountability for in-transit SRC I ammunition was maintained and the ammunition was received, thereby creating a potential gap in accountability and visibility of this ammunition. The military services have not consistently ensured timely, complete, and accurate information to maintain full visibility of SRC I ammunition in the continental United States. We found the Army has not ensured timely and complete information of SRC I ammunition returned to the contractor, but has begun to take action to ensure reporting to WARS-NT to improve visibility. We also found the Army had inaccurately categorized two variants of SRC I rockets, but took immediate action to add the rocket variants to the catalog listing of SRC I ammunition. Further, we identified examples of the military services not entering timely information in the Defense Transportation Tracking System (DTTS) on shipments to aid Military Surface Deployment and Distribution Command tracking by satellite, and of the services entering inaccurate or incomplete data about shipments of SRC I ammunition, which affects visibility of SRC I ammunition in transit. We found that the Army did not have timely, complete, or accurate information of its SRC I ammunition, but has taken action in two areas in order to improve visibility. In one area, we found Army officials had not ensured timely and complete information of SRC I ammunition returned to the contractor for repair, upgrade, maintenance, or testing and had not followed guidance for maintaining visibility of SRC I missiles. While the Army’s WARS-NT system, which is the Army’s official system for tracking SRC I ammunition, provided visibility of SRC I missiles located at the contractor facility, WARS-NT did not have timely or complete records to show visibility of all SRC I missiles at the contractor’s site. In January 2015, we identified an October 2014 shipment of 58 SRC I missiles sent from an Army depot to a contractor facility for repair. Although we confirmed during our site visit that the 58 missiles were located at the contractor’s facility and that the contractor’s automated information system accounted for the missiles, we found that WARS-NT did not have timely or complete data about the shipped 58 SRC I missiles. After we identified the discrepancies in records systems, Army officials acknowledged that while it is an Army requirement for a contractor to report the receipt of these items to the WARS-NT program office, this requirement was not included in the contract. Army officials are taking action and are coordinating a modification to the contract to require the prime contractor to routinely report receipt of shipments to WARS-NT per Army regulation. In the second area, we found that WARS-NT had inaccurately categorized two variants of SRC I rockets. Specifically, we found 55 SRC I ammunition items—variants of the M72 rocket—were not included in the WARS-NT system as SRC I ammunition items. After we noted the omission of the rocket variants in WARS-NT as SRC I ammunition, Army officials took action in August 2015 to add the rocket variants to the catalog listing of SRC I ammunition and in the WARS-NT system as SRC I ammunition. We found that the military services, as required by DOD regulation, used satellite tracking for nearly all of the 104 shipments of SRC I ammunition that we reviewed; however, the services did not always enter timely, accurate, and complete information that is required to aid tracking. The Defense Transportation Regulation requires satellite tracking of shipments of SRC I ammunition via the Defense Transportation Tracking System (DTTS). We found that 103 of 104 shipments of SRC I ammunition in a non-generalizable sample we reviewed were tracked in DTTS using satellite monitoring. DTTS, which is maintained by the Military Surface Deployment and Distribution Command, which falls under the U.S Transportation Command, provides satellite tracking capability of shipments of sensitive conventional arms, ammunition and explosives, including SRC I ammunition items, from the point of departure until the point of arrival. However, we observed problems with the timeliness, accuracy, and completeness of the data provided by the military services in DTTS, which limited the information available to aid the Military Surface Deployment and Distribution Command’s tracking of these shipments and its ability to facilitate responses to any incidents, if necessary. We found that the military services did not always enter timely information in DTTS on SRC I ammunition shipments to aid the Military Surface Deployment and Distribution Command’s tracking of SRC I ammunition by satellite. We observed timeliness problems both at the point of shipment departure and the point of shipment arrival. Shipment departure: The Defense Transportation Regulation specifies that the military services’ shipping offices must enter shipping information in DTTS prior to carrier departure. Data provided by the Military Surface Deployment and Distribution Command showed that information about 93 of 1,008 shipments identified as containing SRC I items between November 1, 2013, and April 30, 2015, were not in DTTS at the time of carrier departure. According to Military Surface Deployment and Distribution Command’s data, information was entered more than 1 hour after carrier departure for 68 of the 93 shipments. On average, information about these 68 shipments was not entered until approximately 8 hours after departure. According to Military Surface Deployment and Distribution Command officials, when information is not entered in the DTTS at the time of carrier departure, the command is still notified that these shipments are on the road when drivers turn on their satellite monitoring devices. However, the command does not have information about the contents of these shipments and therefore DTTS is unable to provide essential information to initiate rapid emergency response to in-transit accidents or incidents to minimize effect. Additionally, if a driver did not turn on the satellite monitoring device, the command would not be alerted to that situation since it would be unaware that a shipment was expected. Shipment arrival: The Defense Transportation Regulation requires entry into DTTS of confirmation of receipt of SRC I shipments within 2 hours of the offloading of each shipment. Data provided by the Military Surface Deployment and Distribution Command for SRC I shipments between November 1, 2013, and April 30, 2015, showed that 572 of 992 shipments to the military services containing SRC I items were not confirmed within the calendar month that they arrived. Further, as of April 30, 2015, Military Surface Deployment and Distribution Command data shows a backlog of 364 SRC I shipments to the military services dating as far back as November 2011 that had not been confirmed. According to Military Surface Deployment and Distribution Command officials, shipments that are not confirmed in DTTS as required hinder their ability to ensure successful transportation of SRC I ammunition because it requires the command to rely solely on the carrier to confirm that SRC I ammunition has been delivered. The Military Surface Deployment and Distribution Command and the military services have taken steps to improve the timeliness of data in DTTS. The Military Surface Deployment and Distribution Command works with designated military service representatives on transportation issues, and provides reports to the military representatives on timeliness of confirmation of individual SRC I shipments and SRC I shipments from prior months that have not been confirmed. Military Surface Deployment and Distribution Command officials also told us that they have been working to try to reduce systemic causes of shipments not being in DTTS at the time of shipment departure, such as system interface delays. Similarly, military service representatives told us that they have also tried to address issues of timeliness of reporting in DTTS. For example, the Army issued guidance in May 2014 reminding transportation offices and ammunition supply points of their responsibilities with regard to entering information in DTTS. However, both Military Surface Deployment and Distribution Command officials and the military service representatives acknowledged their collaboration could be improved to determine what information is needed to improve the military services’ oversight of the timeliness of data entry in DTTS. For example: With regard to shipments not entered in the system in a timely manner, Military Surface Deployment and Distribution Command officials told us that they provided reports to the military service representatives on shipments not in the system at the time of departure; however, they stopped notifying the military service representatives through emails to request assistance because they did not observe a decrease in the number of such shipments. With regard to shipment confirmations, while the Military Surface Deployment and Distribution Command continues to provide reports on SRC I shipments that were not confirmed in a timely manner, military service representatives told us that the information they are provided does not include sufficient detail for them to work with receiving locations to improve compliance with confirmation requirements. For example, the report provided by the Military Surface Deployment and Distribution Command does not identify the office responsible for confirmation, and it provides arrival time rather than offload time, although confirmation requirements in the Defense Transportation Regulation cite time elapsed from offload time. Until the Military Surface Deployment and Distribution Command and the military services collaboratively determine the specific information required for the military services to ensure timely data entry into DTTS, in accordance with the Defense Transportation Regulation, the Military Surface Deployment and Distribution Command will continue to lack full visibility of shipments of SRC I ammunition at certain points during the shipping process and the military services will not be well positioned to improve their oversight of the timeliness of data entry. We identified examples of the military services entering incomplete or inaccurate data in DTTS about shipments of SRC I ammunition. Incomplete information: The transportation control number for 8 of 104 shipments in our sample was not listed in DTTS, which limits the information available to the Military Surface Deployment and Distribution Command about individual shipments being tracked. For example, if one or more transportation control numbers associated with a shipment are not listed in DTTS, the Military Surface Deployment and Distribution Command may not have accurate information about the type, quantity, and security risk category of ammunition being tracked. 164 of 1,008 SRC I shipments from November 1, 2013, through April 30, 2015, which were reported to us by the Military Surface Deployment and Distribution Command, were missing data in the Department of Defense Identification Code field, which provides information about the specific type of ammunition being shipped. Inaccurate information—9 of 104 shipments in our sample had inaccurate controlled inventory items codes and were not identified in DTTS as SRC I shipments, which required us to go back to the Military Surface Deployment and Distribution Command to obtain additional information to confirm the shipment had been tracked by satellite. According to Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government, agencies should have relevant, reliable, and timely information for decision-making and external reporting purposes. Completeness and accuracy are key characteristics of reliable data and refer to (1) the extent to which relevant records are present and that fields in each record are populated appropriately; (2) recorded data reflect the actual underlying information. Military Surface Deployment and Distribution Command officials told us that they attempted to address completeness and accuracy issues on a shipment-by-shipment basis. According to the officials, when an operator responsible for tracking an individual shipment notices missing or inaccurate information—such as when information in the paperwork given to the driver does not match information in the system—the operator attempts to work with the military service’s shipping office to correct that information for the shipment. However, neither the military services nor the Military Surface Deployment and Distribution Command have conducted an analysis of the problems the Military Surface Deployment and Distribution Command has observed with the completeness and accuracy of data entered by the military services to identify areas for improvement on a broader scale. Until the military services, with the aid of the Military Surface Deployment and Distribution Command, conduct analysis of the completeness and accuracy of data entered into DTTS by shippers on SRC I ammunition shipments, DOD will continue to lack full visibility of shipments of SRC I ammunition and the military services will not be well positioned to improve their oversight of the completeness and accuracy of the data. SRC I ammunition is treated as a higher risk than other conventional ammunition and serves as a potential threat if it were obtained and used by unauthorized individuals or groups. We found that the military services maintained accountability in their automated information systems of SRC I ammunition at 11 sampled locations. However, we found examples of SRC I ammunition items that were in the physical custody of the Air Force but owned by other services and accountability was not maintained on the Air Force’s system of record. If the Air Force does not revise guidance to clarify that accountability of all SRC I ammunition items in the Air Force’s custody—regardless of ownership—is maintained in the Air Force’s system of record, both the Air Force and the owning service will not have full assurance that accountability was maintained. Also, we found that the military services generally recorded shipment and receipt of SRC I ammunition in their accountability systems, but the Army and Marine Corps do not have guidance that required the receipting of SRC I ammunition in a timely manner, in accordance with DOD policy. Until the Army, at the depot-level, and the Marine Corps finalize and implement guidance that addresses the required time frame for receipting SRC I ammunition, Army and Marine Corps officials will not have the data they need to help assure accountability for all shipped SRC I ammunition. Further, the Air Force, Navy, and Marine Corps have policies or plans regarding maintaining in-transit accountability for shipped SRC I ammunition to generally adhere to DOD requirements, but the Army’s policy and processes do not fully adhere. Unless the Army evaluates and identifies actions to retain accountability for in-transit items until acknowledgment of receipt, the Army will not have a path forward to ensure that accountability for in-transit SRC I ammunition was maintained and the ammunition was received, thereby creating a potential gap in accountability and visibility of this ammunition. In addition, we found that the military services have not always entered timely information in DTTS on SRC I ammunition shipments, as specified in the Defense Transportation Regulation, to aid the Military Surface Deployment and Distribution Command’s tracking and visibility of SRC I ammunition by satellite. However, the Military Surface Deployment and Distribution Command and the military services have not agreed on the specific information required for the military services to ensure timely data entry into DTTS, in accordance with the Defense Transportation Regulation. Moreover, we identified examples of the military services entering incomplete or inaccurate data in DTTS about shipments of SRC I ammunition. Until the Military Surface Deployment and Distribution Command and the military services collaboratively determine the specific information required for the military services to ensure timely data entry into DTTS, and the military services, with the aid of the Military Surface Deployment and Distribution Command, conduct analysis of the completeness and accuracy of data entered into DTTS military services’ shipping offices on SRC I ammunition shipments, the Military Surface Deployment and Distribution Command will continue to lack full visibility of shipments of SRC I ammunition and the military services will not be well positioned to improve their oversight of the timeliness, completeness, and accuracy of data entered in DTTS. We are making six recommendations to enhance the department’s policy and procedures and improve the accountability and visibility of SRC I ammunition. To ensure the accountability and protection of SRC I ammunition, in accordance with DOD policy, we recommend the Secretary of Defense direct the Secretary of the Air Force to revise guidance to clarify that accountability for all SRC I ammunition items in the Air Force’s custody— regardless of ownership—should be maintained in the Air Force’s system of record. To ensure the Army and Marine Corps record the receipt of shipped SRC I ammunition in their accountability systems, and in accordance with DOD policy, we recommend the Secretary of Defense direct: the Secretary of the Army to finalize and implement guidance that addresses the required time frame for receipting SRC I ammunition at the depot level. the Commandant of the Marine Corps to finalize and implement guidance that addresses the required time frame for receipting SRC I ammunition at Marine Corps locations. To ensure the Army retains accountability of SRC I ammunition in an in- transit status, consistent with DOD policy, we recommend the Secretary of Defense direct the Secretary of the Army to evaluate and identify actions to enable the Army to retain accountability for in-transit items until acknowledgment of receipt. To help improve visibility and tracking of SRC I ammunition shipments, we recommend the Secretary of Defense direct the Secretaries of the military departments and the Military Surface Deployment and Distribution Command, through the Commander of the U.S. Transportation Command, to collaboratively determine the specific information required for the military services to ensure timely data entry into DTTS, in accordance with the Defense Transportation Regulation. To help improve the completeness and accuracy of data provided by the military services to the Military Surface Deployment and Distribution Command in accordance with federal internal control standards, we recommend the Secretary of Defense direct the Secretaries of the military departments, with the aid of the Military Surface Deployment and Distribution Command, to conduct analysis of the completeness and accuracy of the data entered into DTTS. We provided a draft of this report to DOD for review and comment; the department provided technical comments that we considered and incorporated as appropriate. DOD also provided written comments on our recommendations, which are reprinted in appendix V. In commenting on this draft, DOD concurred with all six of our recommendations. With respect to the first recommendation to ensure the accountability and protection of SRC I ammunition, DOD stated that the Air Force released a memorandum on December 24, 2015, directing Air Force units to account for all SRC I ammunition items in their custody, regardless of ownership, and to maintain them in the Combat Ammunition System. Additionally, DOD stated that such procedures will be included in Air Force guidance by September 30, 2016. With respect to our second and third recommendations to ensure the Army and Marine Corps record the receipt of shipped SRC I ammunition in their accountability systems within the required timeframes, DOD stated that the Army will include procedures on the required time frame for receipting SRC I ammunition at the depot-level in their guidance by September 30, 2016. Further, DOD stated that the Marine Corps has issued interim guidance via a Naval Message in January 2016 to address SRC I ammunition accountability along with required receipt times and that such procedures will be included in their guidance by June 30, 2016. Regarding our fourth recommendation to ensure the Army retains accountability of SRC I ammunition in an in-transit status, DOD stated that the Army will evaluate and identify by June 30, 2016, actions to enable the Army to retain accountability for in-transit items until acknowledgment of receipt. Further, DOD stated the proposed actions will then be prioritized for incorporation into any required follow-on work with Army Class V management systems, such as the Logistics Modernization Program and the Standard Army Ammunition System. Regarding our fifth recommendation to help improve visibility and tracking of SRC I ammunition shipments, DOD stated that the military services and the Military Surface Deployment and Distribution Command will collaboratively determine the specific information the Military Surface Deployment and Distribution Command can provide to the military services to correct data missing in DTTS at the time of shipment, and to complete shipment receipts. Furthermore, to provide greater oversight of the DTTS data, DOD stated the military services and the Military Surface Deployment and Distribution Command will develop the processes required to ensure regular feedback on accuracy and timeliness. Finally, with respect to our sixth recommendation to help improve the completeness and accuracy of data provided by the military services to the Military Surface Deployment and Distribution Command, DOD stated that the military services and the Military Surface Deployment and Distribution Command will complete the necessary analysis of the completeness and accuracy of the data entered into DTTS. We are sending copies of this report to the appropriate congressional committees, the Secretary of Defense; the Secretaries of the Army, the Navy, and the Air Force; and the Commandant of the Marine Corps.

GAO staff members who made key contributions to this report are listed in appendix VI. Our review of the Department of Defense’s (DOD) management of SRC I ammunition focused on the four military services— Army, Navy, Marine Corps, and Air Force— because each military service owns, stores, and ships SRC I ammunition. To determine the extent to which the military services have maintained accountability of SRC I ammunition in the continental United States, we reviewed DOD policy and military service guidance, including Department of Defense Manual (DODM) 5100.76, Physical Security of Sensitive Conventional Arms, Ammunition, and Explosives (AA&E), (Apr. 17, 2012), among others, detailing: continuous accountability, frequency and process for conducting physical inventories, process for making adjustments to the electronic record if necessary, tracking of SRC I ammunition by serial number, and the shipment of SRC I ammunition in the continental United States. During our review, we visited 11 military locations—including 3 Army depots and 8 military service locations, such as military service installations, bases, and ammunition supply points, with SRC I ammunition—selected based on a number of factors including the size of SRC I inventory, the number of shipments to and from the location, and the variety of SRC I ammunition being stored. We also visited a contractor with a current production contract for SRC I missiles as SRC I ammunition items are in the contractor’s custody while at the contractor’s facility for repair, maintenance, or upgrade. Additionally, we interviewed OSD and military services officials responsible for the management of SRC I ammunition, including inventory personnel and transportation officials, to gain an understanding of the frequency and process for conducting physical inventories and how shipments of SRC I ammunition are coordinated. We compared a non-generalizable sample of over 600 SRC I ammunition items against the records in the military services’ automated information systems to verify accountability. For the Army we used the Logistics Modernization Program (LMP), Standard Army Ammunition System- Modernization (SAAS-MOD), and Worldwide Ammunition Reporting System-New Technology (WARS-NT). For the Navy and Marine Corps we used Ordnance Information System- Wholesale (OIS-W), Ordnance Information System-Retail (OIS-R), and Ordnance Information System- Marine Corps (OIS-MC). For the Air Force we used Combat Ammunition System (CAS). Specifically, during our site visits to 11 military locations and 1 contractor location, we went through storage buildings with SRC I ammunition and selected SRC I ammunition from different pallets to include a range of SRC I items as well as items from recent shipments, and documented identifying information including serial and production lot number. We verified the Army, Navy, and Marine Corps SRC I ammunition items by serial and lot number. Due to the way the Air Force maintains its records, we verified their SRC I ammunition to records based on lot number and quantity. We analyzed DOD policy and military service guidance on frequency and process for conducting physical inventories and reviewed supporting documentation to determine whether the services were maintaining accountability by conducting physical inventories according to requirements. For Army depots, we collected documentation of completed physical inventories for three fiscal years prior to our audit work— 2012, 2013, and 2014 and conducted site visits to three Army depots to observe a walk-through of their physical inventory process. We selected the three Army depots to visit based on a number of factors, including range in quantity and type of SRC I in storage and recent shipments. To supplement our site visits, we also interviewed inventory personnel at the remaining depots regarding the physical inventory process and process for adjusting the electronic record, if necessary. For five military service locations we visited, we requested documentation of the last three completed physical inventories to obtain a variety of physical inventories (e.g., monthly, quarterly, annually, or change in command) and we also observed a walk-through of their physical inventory process. Further, to supplement our site visits, we randomly selected 10 additional Air Force locations and obtained documentation for their last three completed physical inventories. We reviewed the inventories for our non- generalizable sample of 22 selected locations to determine whether physical inventories were being conducted in accordance with DOD policy and military service guidance and at required frequencies. Finally, during our site visit with the contractor, we confirmed the contractor had completed physical inventories of SRC I missiles in its custody as well as discussed with officials how they conduct physical inventories of SRC I ammunition at their location. We also examined the military services’ guidance and procedures for maintaining accountability for items owned by one service but in the physical custody of another service. We analyzed DOD policy and military service guidance on maintaining accountability for ammunition to determine the extent to which military services’ guidance aligned with DOD policy. We also analyzed data and documents obtained from the Air Force, Army, and Marine Corps on 55 SRC I items from 4 shipments of SRC I ammunition in the continental United States that contained ammunition owned by the Army or Marine Corps that was shipped to and held in the physical custody of the Air Force but for which we had found that accountability was not maintained on the Air Force’s system of record. We identified these items because we were unable to locate receipts for certain shipments in the Air Force’s system of record when we reviewed it for our analysis of the timeliness of receipt of shipments of SRC I ammunition described below. Information we report about the number of SRC I items or shipments we identified as being owned by another service but in the physical custody of the Air Force and not maintained on the Air Force’s accountable record is non-generalizable to the overall universe of SRC I items but provides insights on how the Air Force manages items in its physical custody that are owned by another service. Further, we analyzed shipping documents and military service data for a non-generalizable sample of 104 SRC I shipments, and compared receipting time frames for these shipments to military service guidance to analyze how accountability was maintained. When the military services did not have documented guidance on receipting time frames, we obtained information from military service officials about standard procedures followed by the military service. Our sample was comprised of shipments that occurred between November 1, 2013, and April 30, 2015, and that were shipped to or from locations we visited or interviewed. We selected these time frames to provide an 18-month window that provided one prior year’s data and six months that coincided with the period when we were conducting field work. Further, we selected our sample to reflect shipments to or from a variety of military services, locations, and location types. Because our sample of shipments is non-generalizable, results of our analysis cannot be used to make inferences about all SRC I shipments within the continental United States but they provide insights on the military services’ adherence to DOD policy and service-level guidance or standard practice regarding the shipment of SRC I ammunition. For the 104 shipments in our sample, we obtained and reviewed shipping documents and receipt data from the receiving military services’ accountability systems. We compared the receipt data from the receiving military service’s accountability systems to data on shipment arrival time at the receiving location that we obtained from the Defense Transportation Tracking System (DTTS), maintained by the Military Surface Deployment and Distribution Command. For our analysis, we analyzed whether shipments were receipted within 2 business days of the day of arrival of the shipment even though either service guidance or standard practice generally required receipting within 1 business day or less. We allowed for 2 business days because military services’ information systems may take an additional business day to record transactions. Also, we analyzed military service guidance related to providing accountability for in-transit items and compared that guidance to DOD policy to assess whether the military services’ policies and processes for maintaining accountability for in-transit SRC I ammunition items enabled the military services to maintain accountability of SRC I ammunition in the continental United States. When we determined that a military service’s guidance and processes did not align with DOD policy, we requested and reviewed additional documentation, such as analyses of gaps in information system capabilities and documentation of planning of system upgrades, and conducted interviews with military service officials to determine the reasons for the differences. To determine the extent to which DOD has maintained visibility of SRC I ammunition in the continental United States, we reviewed DOD policy and military service guidance, including DODM 5100.76 and the Defense Transportation Regulation, among others, detailing procedures to maintain visibility of SRC I ammunition, including in-transit visibility during shipment, satellite tracking of shipments, and timeframes for entering shipment information into DTTS. In addition, we interviewed relevant officials at the Office of the Secretary of Defense, the military services, U.S. Transportation Command, and the Military Surface Deployment and Distribution Command to gain an understanding of how visibility is maintained in their automated information systems, how shipments of SRC I ammunition are processed for shipping and entered into DTTS, and how visibility is maintained while the shipment is in transit. We obtained SRC I ammunition data from each of the military services’ automated information systems as of April 30, 2015, and analyzed this data for timely, complete and accurate information to maintain full visibility of SRC I ammunition in the continental United States. Specifically, we compared this data, based on a number of elements including type of SRC I ammunition, location in the continental United States, condition of the SRC I ammunition, and military service ownership codes, against information in the department’s National Level Ammunition Capability (NLAC) system, a DOD-wide repository that provides visibility of SRC I ammunition data, to identify inconsistencies across DOD and the military services. We also analyzed DOD requirements for satellite tracking from the Defense Transportation Regulation and obtained and analyzed information from DTTS provided by the Military Surface Deployment and Distribution Command about satellite tracking of shipments of SRC I ammunition in the continental United States from November 1, 2013, through April 30, 2015, to gain an understanding of how visibility is maintained. We analyzed data from November 1, 2013, to April 30, 2015, to correspond to the time frame we used to select our non-generalizable sample of shipments for review. To examine whether the military services used satellite tracking for shipments included in our non-generalizable sample of 104 shipments described above, we compared the transportation control number for each shipment in our sample to transportation control numbers associated with SRC I shipments in DTTS. When we could not locate a shipment in DTTS by transportation control number, we followed up with the Military Surface Deployment and Distribution Command to obtain additional information about the shipment, since in some cases the transportation control number was in DTTS but not in the data provided to us since the data was provided based on a bill-of-lading number. For the shipments that neither we nor the Military Surface Deployment and Distribution Command could locate in DTTS, we requested additional information about the shipment from military service officials to attempt to locate the shipment in DTTS through a means besides the transportation control number. For example, in some cases, the shipper had not identified the shipment in DTTS by transportation control number, and we were able to obtain and search on the bill-of-lading number to confirm that the shipment had been tracked in DTTS. We also examined the extent to which the military services provided timely data in DTTS, in accordance with the Defense Transportation Regulation, to ensure visibility. We analyzed data and reports provided by the Military Surface Deployment and Distribution Command from DTTS to identify the number of SRC I shipments between November 1, 2013, and April 30, 2015, for which information had not been entered into the system at the time of shipment departure and the number of shipments that were not confirmed within the calendar month of arrival. Further, we examined the extent to which the military services provided accurate and complete data in DTTS. We compared values for key data fields in DTTS, such as the DOD Identification Code and transportation control number, to shipping documents for selected shipments from our sample of 104 shipments. We also analyzed the number of missing values for selected data fields in DTTS for the 1,008 SRC I shipments in the continental United States between November 1, 2013, and April 30, 2015, reported to us by the Military Surface Deployment and Distribution Command. While we identified some issues related to the accuracy and completeness of DTTS data that are described in this report and may affect the reliability of the overall number of SRC I shipments during this time frame, we determined that the data were sufficiently reliable for our purposes of analyzing information about individual shipments in our sample and general trends in the timeliness, accuracy, and completeness of data entry in DTTS. To obtain additional information about the timeliness, accuracy, and completeness issues we identified and steps that were being taken to address these issues, we conducted interviews with U.S Transportation Command and Military Surface Deployment and Distribution Command officials, as well as representatives from each of the military services who are assigned to coordinate with the Military Surface Deployment and Distribution Command on transportation issues and reviewed additional documentation provided by the Military Surface Deployment and Distribution Command and the military services, such as reporting provided by the Military Surface Deployment and Distribution Command to the military services. Table 4 lists the offices that we visited or contacted during our review. We conducted this performance audit from September 2014 to February 2016 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. Department of Defense Manual (DODM) 5100.76, Physical Security of Sensitive Conventional Arms, Ammunition, and Explosives (AA&E) sets forth DOD policy on the physical security of sensitive conventional AA&E. According to DODM 5100.76, continuous program and policy oversight is required to ensure protection of AA&E within DOD, and DOD components are required to track and conduct physical inventories of SRC I ammunition by serial number. DOD policy requires SRC I ammunition to be treated as a higher risk than other conventional ammunition which requires a higher level of protection and security. DOD and the military services have policy and guidance on how to account for, safeguard, conduct physical inventories, adjust if necessary, track, and ship SRC I ammunition within and between services and to contractors for repair, as shown in table 5 below. In May 2014, we found that the department has experienced some challenges in implementing hazardous materials (HAZMAT) regulations and other guidance, which can adversely affect the safe, timely, and cost- effective transportation of HAZMAT. For example, we found that at least 44 times during fiscal years 2012 and 2013, DOD installations did not provide commercial carriers with access to secure hold areas for arms, ammunition, and explosives shipments or assist them in finding alternatives, as required by DOD regulations. We made 3 recommendations and all 3 have been closed as implemented. Table 7 summarizes our recommendations and their implementation status. In March 2014, we found that the military services’ automated information systems used to maintain accountability for ammunition inventory have some limitations that affect their ability to facilitate efficient management of conventional ammunition. For example, the systems cannot directly exchange ammunition data because they use different exchange formats that require extra time and resources to ensure data efficiency when exchanging between systems. We also found that Army reports of ammunition inventory data, used in the process for collecting and sharing ammunition data among the military services do not include information on certain missiles. We concluded that without incorporating these items in the Army’s report, DOD may lack full transparency about all available items and may miss opportunities to avoid procurement costs for certain usable items that may already be available in the Army’s stockpile. We made 7 recommendations, of which 2 have been implemented and 5 remain open. Table 8 summarizes our recommendations and their implementation status. In April 2000, we found internal controls weaknesses at an Army ammunition depot that resulted in a loss of accountability and control over SRC I rockets. For example, serial number control of SRC I rockets was lost at the time of shipment from the contractor because serial numbers listed on receiving reports that accompanied shipments did not correspond to the actual items and quantities of the respective shipments. We also noted that these control weaknesses indicate that the depot’s inventory business processes for these sensitive items do not fully comply with federal accounting and systems requirements. We made 10 recommendations, of which 9 have been implemented and 1 has not been implemented. Table 9 summarizes our recommendations and their implementation status. In September 1997, we found oversight weaknesses with SRC I rockets and that the military services have different procedures and requirements for maintaining oversight of the rockets. Further, we found that discrepancies existed between records of the number of missiles and a physical count we conducted. In addition, we identified that some facilities were not fully complying with DOD physical security requirements. We made 5 recommendations, of which all 5 have been closed as implemented. Table 10 summarizes the recommendations and their implementation status. In September 1994, we found discrepancies in the quantities, locations, and serial numbers of SRC I missiles inventories, which we concluded indicated that the services’ oversight and recordkeeping for the missiles is poor. We also noted, among other findings, that the services did not know how many missiles they should have in their possession because they lacked systems to track the missiles by serial number. We made 6 recommendations, all of which have been implemented. Table 11 summarizes the recommendations and their implementation status. In addition to the contact named above, Marilyn Wasleski (Assistant Director), Laura Czohara, Martin de Alteriis, Amie Lesser, Felicia Lopez, Sean Manzano, Anne McDonough-Hughes, Steve Pruitt, and Richard Powelson made key contributions to this report.","DOD manages a stockpile of more than 226,000 SRC I missiles and rockets in the continental United States. SRC I conventional ammunition, which refers to nonnuclear, portable missiles and rockets in a ready-to-fire configuration, is managed as a higher risk than other conventional ammunition and serves as a potential threat if it were obtained by unauthorized individuals or groups. Senate Report 113-176 (2014) included a provision for GAO to review aspects of DOD's management of SRC I ammunition. This report addresses the extent to which the military services have maintained (1) accountability and (2) visibility (i.e., access to accurate information) of SRC I ammunition in the continental United States. GAO reviewed DOD and military service policies, regulations, and guidance on physical inventories and shipping of SRC I ammunition; conducted visits at a non-generalizable sample of 11 military service locations selected based on inventory size and number of shipments of SRC I ammunition; interviewed officials; and analyzed data on SRC I on-hand assets as of April 30, 2015, and on non-generalizable samples of SRC I shipments from November 1, 2013, to April 30, 2015. The military services maintained accountability (i.e., accurate records) of Security Risk Category (SRC) I conventional ammunition at 11 sampled locations within the continental United States; however, GAO identified gaps in some service-level guidance and procedures for how SRC I ammunition is accounted for across locations. GAO identified instances in which the Navy and Army had taken actions to enhance the accountability of the physical inventories of SRC I ammunition, such as the Army evaluating its methodology to ensure contractors with SRC I ammunition in their custody submit documentation to verify completion of inventories. However, GAO identified 55 SRC I ammunition items that were in the physical custody of the Air Force—though owned by the Army or Marine Corps—but accountability was not maintained in any service's system of record while at the Air Force location. Department of Defense (DOD) policy requires that the DOD component having physical custody of materiel maintain accountability in its records regardless of the owner, but the Air Force's guidance requires that ammunition owned by other services be tracked only in a “non-accountable” program. If the Air Force does not revise its guidance to require that accountability be maintained regardless of ownership, the Air Force and the owning service will not have complete records of management of the ammunition and the owning service will not have full assurance that accountability was maintained. GAO found that Army and Marine Corps guidance does not specify a time frame for receipting shipments of SRC I ammunition. Records showed that 12 of 21 shipments to Army depots and 5 of 30 shipments to Marine Corps locations were receipted more than 2 business days after truck arrival. Until Army and Marine Corps officials finalize and implement guidance on required time frames for receipting SRC I ammunition, officials cannot reasonably assure accountability for all shipped SRC I ammunition. The military services have not consistently ensured timely, complete, and accurate information to maintain full visibility of SRC I ammunition in the continental United States. For example, 93 of 1,008 shipments GAO examined were not entered in DOD's Defense Transportation Tracking System (DTTS) at the time of departure. Also, 9 of 104 shipments GAO examined in more detail had inaccurate controlled inventory item codes and were not identified in DTTS as SRC I shipments. The Military Surface Deployment and Distribution Command and the military services have not collaboratively determined the specific information required for the military services to ensure timely data entry into DTTS. Further, the military services, with the aid of the Military Surface Deployment and Distribution Command, have not conducted analysis of the completeness and accuracy of data entered into DTTS by shippers on SRC I ammunition shipments. Until these actions are taken, the Military Surface Deployment and Distribution Command will not have full visibility of shipments of SRC I ammunition and the military services will not be well positioned to improve their oversight of the timeliness, completeness, and accuracy of data entered in DTTS. GAO recommends that DOD revise and finalize guidance and improve the timeliness, completeness, and accuracy of information to maintain full accountability and visibility of SRC I ammunition. DOD concurred with all six recommendations and identified specific steps it has already taken as well as plans to address them.",govreport
"Our prior report recommended that DOD immediately reverse the $615 million of illegal and otherwise improper closed account adjustments identified in the report and determine the correct accounting for these adjustments after the reversal. Of the $615 million of illegal and otherwise improper adjustments, DOD has agreed that $592 million, or about 96 percent, of the adjustments should not have been made and has reversed the adjustments. However, because of DOD’s long-standing accounting accuracy problems, in many cases, reversing the transactions brought to light additional accounting problems that will require detailed reviews to determine the accounting actions necessary to correct the reversed transactions. As a result, neither DOD nor we can determine how much remains to be corrected as a result of reversing the adjustments. Table 1 provides additional details on DOD’s reversal of the $615 million fiscal year 2000 illegal and otherwise improper closed account adjustments. For the remaining $23 million that has not been reversed, DOD provided us with additional documentation indicating that $8 million of the adjustments were proper and do not need to be reversed. We still consider the remaining $15 million to be unnecessary or unsupported adjustments since DOD has not provided sufficient support to show otherwise. The $592 million of illegal and otherwise improper closed account adjustments discussed in our earlier report that have now been reversed involved 45 contracts. For 30 of the 45 contracts, the reversals identified additional accounting errors that must also be corrected. The 30 contracts include over $457 million (77 percent) of the $592 million in reversed transactions. Because of the complexity of the contracts and time it takes to conduct a complete reaudit, officials at the Defense Finance and Accounting Service’s (DFAS) Columbus Center estimate that it will take over 21,000 hours to correct the accounting for the 30 contracts. For example, for one contract we found that DFAS Columbus had made $210 million of closed account adjustments that should not have been made because the initial disbursement was recorded against the correct ACRN on the contract. The reason given for the adjustment was that DFAS Columbus could not pay a November 1999 invoice from a contractor for $685,000 because the cited ACRN on the invoice did not have sufficient funds. The inability to pay the invoice prompted DFAS to conduct an audit of the contract that resulted in over $590 million of adjustments to closed appropriation accounts. Our earlier audit found that of the $590 million of adjustments, $210 million were unnecessary and should not have been made because the actual disbursements—some of which were made over 10 years earlier—had been recorded correctly. The $210 million was part of the $615 million of illegal or otherwise improper transactions we identified in our earlier audit. In response to our recommendation that DOD reverse and correct the $210 million of unnecessary adjustments, DFAS Columbus reversed all $590 million of the closed account adjustments. According to DFAS officials, when reversing adjustments of this size, they generally have to reverse all the transactions involved with an adjustment not just the canceled ones. After the adjustments were reversed, other errors were created that must now be researched and corrected. For example, for this one contract, the reversal of the contract’s accounting records showed that 63 contract ACRNs had negative unliquidated obligations (NULO) totaling $85.4 million. DFAS Columbus estimates that it will take about 2,300 hours to reaudit and correct the contract. Our earlier review of another contract found that DFAS Columbus had recorded an adjustment that illegally moved $79 million of disbursement charges from fiscal years 1993 through 1995 research and development appropriations to charges against a canceled fiscal year 1992 research and development appropriation. According to the contract files, the adjustment was made to redistribute the disbursement charges in accordance with the “pay oldest funds first” payment terms specified in the contract. However, we found that the redistribution was illegal because it moved disbursement charges back to an appropriation account that had closed several months before the initial disbursement was made. For example, the initial $79 million disbursement occurred in February 1999, but the adjustment resulted in a charge against an appropriation that canceled 4 months earlier on September 30, 1998. DOD agreed that the adjustment was illegal and reversed the $79 million. The reversal identified other accounting errors on the contract that now must be corrected. According to DFAS contract accounting records, as of April 2002, the contract had NULOs totaling over $100 million that will need to be researched and corrected. DFAS Columbus officials estimate that a reaudit of this contract will take over 1,850 hours to complete. DOD officials told us they plan to complete all 30 reaudits to correct the fiscal year 2000 illegal and otherwise improper adjustments by September 30, 2002. In addition to DFAS’s reaudit of the contract, Air Force officials have also initiated an investigation into the circumstances surrounding the initial $79 million illegal adjustment to determine if personnel responsible for monitoring and administering the contract acted improperly, including the possibility that the adjustments may have resulted in Antideficiency Act violations. Air Force officials told us that they plan to complete the investigation and issue their report before the end of fiscal year 2002. We previously reported that the DFAS contract reconciliation system (CRS) and other controls necessary to ensure that adjustments to closed appropriation accounts were proper were not in place. We noted that DOD was in the process of upgrading CRS and correcting other control problems that significantly contributed to many of the illegal or otherwise improper adjustments to closed accounts. However, because DOD did not complete many of these actions until the end of fiscal year 2001, controls were not in place to ensure that the $1.9 billion of closed account adjustments made during fiscal year 2001 were legal and proper. Our evaluation of $291 million (15 percent) of DOD’s reported $1.9 billion fiscal year 2001 closed appropriation account adjustments found that $172 million (59 percent) were either illegal or otherwise improper. These adjustments should not have been made because the initial disbursements (1) occurred after the appropriation being charged had already canceled, (2) occurred before the appropriation charged was enacted, or (3) were charged to the correct appropriation in the first place and no adjustment was necessary. Also included in the $172 million of illegal or otherwise improper closed account adjustments were adjustments that were not sufficiently documented to establish that they were proper. These adjustments were considered improper because agencies must be able to provide documentation to show that the adjustments are legal and that they changed an incorrect charge to a correct one. Table 2 provides additional details on the $172 million of adjustments that should not have been made. DOD officials agreed to reverse and correct the $172 million of illegal and otherwise improper closed account adjustments. The remaining $119 million of the $291 million of adjustments was for adequately documented corrections of errors that DOD had made over the years and, therefore, were not in violation of appropriations law or otherwise improper. DOD officials told us they plan to review another $1.1 billion of fiscal year 2001 closed account adjustments in addition to the $291 million of closed account adjustments that we already reviewed. According to the officials, the additional $1.1 billion of adjustments were selected based on various factors including large dollar amounts or indications that the adjustments may be illegal. The officials noted that completion of the review of additional adjustments would result in detailed reviews of $1.4 billion (about 74 percent) of the total $1.9 billion of the closed account adjustments made during fiscal year 2001. According to the officials, they estimate that the additional reviews will involve several hundred contracts and about 1,000 closed account adjustments. They plan to have the additional reviews and reversals of any illegal or otherwise improper adjustments completed by December 31, 2002. However, the officials told us that because there are so many contracts that may have to be reaudited to correct the accounting, they do not plan to have the reaudits and corrections for fiscal year 2001 closed account adjustments completed until September 2004. In our July 2001 testimony and report, we pointed out that DOD did not have adequate systems, controls, and managerial attention to ensure that the $2.7 billion of fiscal year 2000 adjustments affecting closed appropriation accounts were legal and otherwise proper. Our review disclosed that CRS routinely processed billions of dollars of closed appropriation account adjustments without regard to the requirements of the 1990 account closing law. Further compounding this system deficiency was the lack of DOD oversight on how contract modifications were written and processed, which changed the payment terms of some contracts to improperly make available current and expired funds. As discussed earlier, our follow-on review of fiscal year 2001 closed account adjustments found little improvement over fiscal year 2000. As a result, DOD still could not ensure that closed account adjustments made during fiscal year 2001 were legal and otherwise proper. However, once the controls were fully implemented at the beginning of fiscal year 2002, we found that the first 6 months of fiscal year 2002 closed account adjustments dropped by about 80 percent to $200 million when compared with the same 6 months during fiscal year 2001. In May 2001, DOD began implementing CRS controls to identify and prevent illegal backward adjustments. This control compares the actual disbursement date with the appropriation involved in the adjustment to ensure that the adjustment does not result in moving disbursement charges back to an appropriation that had been canceled before the actual disbursement was made. In September 2001, DFAS upgraded CRS to identify and prevent illegal adjustments from moving disbursement charges forward to an appropriation that had not yet been enacted at the time the initial disbursement was made. In addition to upgrading CRS to identify and prevent illegal closed account adjustments, DOD also changed the CRS default reallocation of adjusting payments from oldest funds first to proration. Under the oldest funds first reallocation method, CRS would change disbursements charged to current and expired appropriation accounts to charges against older appropriation accounts even if the initial disbursement charges were correct. Because the DFAS contract payment system, commonly known as MOCAS (Mechanization of Contract Administration Services), prorated payments across various fund cites in the contract if no payment terms were specified in the contract, this change was intended to reduce errors by making both MOCAS and CRS payment allocation defaults the same. Previously, problems with payment reallocations arose during contract reconciliation when payments that MOCAS had initially allocated across various ACRNs on a pro rata basis were redistributed by CRS across ACRNs on an oldest funds first basis. When this occurred, the CRS payment redistributions would differ substantially from how MOCAS had originally applied the payments. As our previous audit showed, these situations created significant problems by moving payment charges from correct ACRNs to incorrect ACRNs on the contract. For example, in one case, DOD initiated a contract reconciliation because there were insufficient funds remaining on an ACRN to pay a $685,000 contractor invoice, and this redistribution process resulted in moving $210 million of correct payment charges to incorrect ACRNs. According to DFAS Columbus officials, supervisory personnel must now approve any deviation from the CRS default program before CRS controls can be overridden to reallocate disbursements in a manner other than proration. DOD’s reported closed account adjustments during the first 6 months of fiscal year 2002 totaled about $200 million, or about 80 percent less than the over $1 billion of closed account adjustments DOD reportedly made during the same 6-month period of fiscal year 2001. According to DFAS officials, they believe that the significant decline in closed account adjustments is a direct result of increased DOD management and employee emphasis on resolving the problems identified in our earlier report that contributed to illegal and otherwise improper closed account adjustments. While DFAS’s controls had greatly reduced closed account adjustments during the first 6 months of fiscal year 2002, our analysis of closed account transactions found that $253,212 of illegal closed account adjustments had been processed from October 1, 2001, through March 31, 2002. These illegal adjustments moved disbursement charges back to appropriations that had canceled before the initial disbursements occurred. We found these adjustments had processed through a DFAS Columbus computer terminal that did not properly identify and prevent these types of illegal adjustments. DFAS officials could not explain why the computer terminal was not operating properly but took immediate action to upgrade it with the appropriate controls. The officials agreed to reverse and correct the $253,212 of illegal adjustments. Our analysis of subsequent closed account adjustments reported after the upgrade did not identify any additional illegal closed account adjustments. Our earlier testimony and report pointed out that DOD’s illegal and otherwise improper closed account adjustments resulted from the lack of basic controls and managerial attention required to properly account for its disbursements consistent with the 1990 account closing law. We also noted that DOD had been aware since 1996 that one of its major systems allowed for disbursements to be charged in a way that was inconsistent with the law, but had done nothing to fix the problem. This lack of fundamental controls and management oversight fostered an atmosphere in which responsible DOD contracting and accounting personnel took it for granted that it was an acceptable practice to adjust the accounting records to use unspent canceled funds on a contract in order to maximize the use of appropriated funds—a process that we concluded, and DOD agreed, was illegal. We stated that DOD would need to effect changes to its systems, policies, procedures, and the overall weak control environment that fostered the $615 million of illegal and otherwise improper adjustments made during fiscal year 2000. To do this, we pointed out that DOD top management must clearly demonstrate its commitment to adhering to the account closing law and eliminate the abuses of appropriations law. The 80 percent reduction of closed account adjustments during the first 6 months of fiscal year 2002 is an indication that, in the short term, DOD policies, procedures, and management commitment aimed at reducing the amount of illegal and otherwise improper closed account adjustments are having the desired effect. However, DOD’s inability to accurately account for and report on disbursements overall are long-term, major problems that are pervasive and complex in nature. For example, for fiscal year 1999, DFAS data showed that almost $1 of every $3 in contract payment transactions was for adjustments to previously recorded payments— $51 billion of adjustments out of $157 billion in transactions. Some of the key causes of these adjustments—for both closed and unclosed accounts— relate to the complex accounting for contracts along with frequent changes in payment allocation terms. Over the years, we have issued numerous reports discussing DOD’s financial management problems, and we have designated DOD financial management as a high-risk area since 1995. The following discussion on DOD’s use of ACRNs and changes in contract payment allocations is illustrative of the convoluted process that contributes to the need to adjust accounting records to correct errors. Contracts can be assigned anywhere from 1 to over 1,000 ACRNs to accumulate appropriation, budget, and management information. Our review of fiscal years 2000 and 2001 closed account adjustments found that, in many cases, the contracts had large numbers of ACRNs. According to DFAS Columbus officials, numerous ACRNs and changes in payment allocations create payment problems by increasing the amount of data that must be entered and opportunities for errors. These problems also lead to costly and extensive contract reconciliations. For example, our review of fiscal year 2001 closed account adjustments on a Navy contract valued at about $38 million found that the contract contained 548 ACRNs and had been modified over 150 times. Also, according to DFAS Columbus’ reconciliation staff, the contract had received two reconciliations, one of which in 1998 produced 15,322 accounting adjustments. In total, we found about $3 million of fiscal year 2001 closed account adjustments for this contract were not adequately supported and, thus, should not have been made. In discussing the contract’s improper closed account adjustments with DFAS Columbus officials, they agreed that the adjustments were not proper and agreed to reverse and correct them. Because of the large number of ACRNs and contract modifications involved, they estimate that it will take over 9,000 hours to complete the contract audit. Our combined review of the 101 contracts included in our detailed review of fiscal years 2000 and 2001 closed account adjustments found that there were 7,440 ACRNs on the 101 contracts—an average of about 74 ACRNs per contract. As table 3 shows, 38 of the 101 contracts (38 percent) had 51 or more ACRNs. We did not determine for each of these contracts why and for what purpose the numerous ACRNs were being used. However, it is clear that simplified contract accounting will be a key element to reform DOD’s financial management. For example, as we pointed out in our July 2001 report, even a simple purchase could cause extensive and costly rework if assigned numerous ACRNs. We noted that a $1,209 Navy contract for children’s toys, candy, and holiday decorations for a child care center was written with most line items (e.g., bubble gum, tootsie rolls, and balloons) assigned separate ACRNs. A separate requisition number was generated for each item ordered, and a separate ACRN was assigned for each requisition. In total, the contract was assigned 46 ACRNs to account for contract obligations against a single appropriation. To record this payment against the one appropriation DFAS Columbus had to manually allocate the payment to all 46 ACRNs. In addition, the contract was modified three times—twice to correct funding data and once to delete (deobligate) the funding on the contract for out-of-stock items. The modification deleting funding did not cite all the affected ACRNs. DFAS Columbus made errors in both entering and allocating payment data, compounding errors made in the modification. Consequently, DFAS Columbus allocated payment for the toy jewelry line item to fruit chew, jump rope, and jack set ACRNs—all of which should have been deleted by modification. Contract delivery was completed in March 1995, but payment was delayed until October 1995. DFAS Columbus officials acknowledged that this payment consumed an excessive amount of time and effort when compared to the time to process a payment charged to only one ACRN. A single ACRN would also have significantly reduced the amount of data entered into the system and the opportunities for errors. Further compounding the problem of numerous ACRNs are changes in how payments are to be allocated across various ACRNs on a contract. For example, our review of an Air Force contract that had 50 ACRNs contained about $126 million of closed account adjustments of which we found that about $100 million (79 percent) were illegal or otherwise improper. Further, the contract had been modified 292 times for various reasons, including changes to how payments were to be allocated across the various ACRNs. For example, the following instructions were included in contract modifications to specify payment instructions for special ACRN XB—one of several special ACRNs on the contract. Contract modification 94 dated October 22, 1993, stated that, “During FY90 pay FY90 funds first until exhausted and during FY91 pay FY91 funds first until exhausted. After these funds are exhausted, pay from the oldest ACRNs first.” Two years later, contract modification 126 added additional payment terms for special ACRN XB as follows: “During FY90 pay FY90 funds first until exhausted and during FY91 pay FY91 funds first until exhausted. During FY94 pay FY88 funds first until exhausted. After these funds are exhausted, pay from oldest ACRNs first.” In June 2000, modification 160 provided more payment instructions for special ACRN XB. The modification noted that special ACRN XB consisted of funds from both the United States and North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). The payment instructions specified that payments were to be made using the oldest U.S. funds before using NATO funds. According to a July 2000 Air Force memorandum from the Air Force Materiel Command’s Deputy Director of Contracting, the special ACRNs were not to be added to any existing contracts or used in new contracts. The Deputy Director noted that the Air Force still had over 1,300 special ACRNs in the system related to the older contracts, and that there was evidence that special ACRNs were still being created or used for new contract line items or subcontract line items. In discussing this memorandum with responsible Air Force contracting officials, we were told that the Air Force no longer uses special ACRNs and that once all the contracts that currently contain special ACRNs are closed out, errors or other accounting problems caused by this type of contract funding should no longer be a problem. DFAS Columbus officials acknowledged that the combination of numerous ACRNs and modifications that change contract payment allocation terms makes it difficult to maintain accurate payment records. They agreed that the $100 million of illegal and otherwise improper closed account adjustments for the Air Force contract discussed above should not have been made. They told us they plan to reverse and correct the illegal and otherwise improper closed account adjustments on the contract as part of their overall effort to correct fiscal year 2001 closed account adjustments. Because of the numerous ACRNs and contract modifications on the contract, DOD estimates that it will take over 1,500 hours to completely correct the accounting for this contract. In discussing the issues of payment errors caused by numerous ACRNs and changing contract payment allocation terms, military service contracting officials agreed that in the past their contracts contained numerous ACRNs and modifications to change payment allocations. They told us that during the last 2 or 3 years, they have started to write contracts to include more specific payment allocation terms, which should make it much easier for DFAS Columbus to pay contractors without making errors that require subsequent adjustments. Further, on October 1, 2001, the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics issued a memorandum in response to our recommendation that he issue a policy to prohibit the writing of contract modifications to change the payment terms of a contract if the change would result in illegal or otherwise improper adjustments. The memorandum instructed the military service secretaries and defense agency directors to make certain that all contracting activities have procedures in place that ensure compliance with the department’s financial management policies, which currently preclude the improper adjustments we identified in our report. It also required all contract modifications that include adjustments to closed appropriation accounts to be supported with contract file documentation sufficient to establish that the adjustments are legal and proper and received supervisory review. It further required that contract modifications involving closed accounts be approved in writing by the appropriate level comptroller or financial resource manager. DFAS Columbus officials acknowledged that the change in contract writing policies and procedures should result in fewer payment errors and adjustments. While we agree that the changes in contract writing procedures and additional policy requirements should help to reduce errors that require subsequent correcting, we found that there are still thousands of older contracts in MOCAS that have one or more closed accounts that will need to be monitored closely to ensure that illegal or otherwise improper adjustments do not occur. For example, at our request, DFAS Columbus analyzed the MOCAS database to identify contracts for which at least one of the appropriations was canceled. The results of the MOCAS inquiry showed that as of April 2002, there were 15,421 active contracts valued at $519 billion for which at least one appropriation had been canceled. DFAS officials told us that these older contracts may contain errors that will not be discovered until a contract is completed and final contract reconciliation is performed. As we have indicated, since we began our closed account work, and especially since our testimony and report on this issue in July 2001, DOD has taken actions to eliminate illegal or otherwise improper adjustments involving closed account records. As noted earlier in this report, these actions are beginning to produce positive short-term results while efforts to address the long-term problems are still ongoing. At the same time, given the severity of the existing problems and the long-term nature of DOD’s transformation efforts, you asked us to identify options the Congress could consider, including prohibiting some or all adjustments to closed accounts. We basically see two options—do nothing at this time or prohibit any adjustments immediately or shortly after an appropriation account is closed. These options are discussed in the context of our closed account work at DOD. However, options that change the account closing law would also apply to all federal agencies unless the Congress specifically limited them to DOD. One option is to take no legislative action at this time and to continue to allow DOD to adjust closed account records when appropriate to correct accounting errors. This would mean that DOD could make adjustments to closed account records when there is sufficient documentation to show that the (1) disbursement was made when the appropriation account to be charged was available to cover the disbursement, (2) agency either did not record the disbursement when it was made or charged it to the wrong appropriation account at the time, and (3) proposed adjustment will result in the disbursement being charged to the proper appropriation account. Given that DOD’s implementation of controls to identify and prevent illegal and otherwise improper adjustments seem to be having a positive effect based on 6 months of analysis, the Congress could postpone any decision to change the law in order to allow DOD additional time to monitor how its implementation of controls, policies, and procedures needed to eliminate illegal and otherwise improper closed account adjustments is working. However, given DOD’s weak overall control environment, unless DOD’s internal controls and management commitment to this problem are sustained, new ways may be developed to circumvent the controls recently put into place. Thus, there is a risk that, over time, illegal or otherwise improper closed account adjustments could reoccur. If the Congress finds in the future that DOD top management does not sustain its commitment to address its overall disbursement problems, the Congress could require a combination of oversight and reporting by DOD as to the validity of any closed account adjustments. The second option is to amend the account closing law to prohibit any adjustments to an appropriation account after it is closed. Under this option, accounting records of an appropriation account would be final when the account was closed. This option would eliminate adjustments to closed accounts as well as the substantial time and expense associated with making them. It would also provide an additional incentive for DOD to keep better records during the time the account is open since there would be no opportunity to correct the records once the account was closed. At the same time, this change would mean that known errors in accounting records could not be corrected once the account was closed and therefore accounting records would be permanently inaccurate. These inaccurate records could also affect DOD’s ability to promptly pay for goods and services. For example, assume that because of accounting errors associated with a closed appropriation account, the unspent balance of a currently available account was reduced to less than the amount needed to make a subsequent payment. If DOD could not correct the error, it would not be able to make the current payment. In another example, assume that because of accounting errors, the balance of a closed account was less than the amount needed to pay an obligation that had been charged to the closed account when it was open. Current law allows the payment to be made from current funds if the closed account balance exceeds the amount of the payment. Prohibiting all adjustments to closed accounts would make permanent the erroneously reduced balance and therefore the payment could not be made with current funds. In each of these examples, DOD would be unable to pay for the goods or services without obtaining an additional appropriation or other form of legislative relief, which could cause a hardship for the contractor. The Congress could also provide a variation of this option by allowing DOD a limited period, such as 6 months or 1 year, after an account is closed to adjust the accounting records for known errors. This option would provide for finality of records, but only after DOD has some additional opportunity to correct errors it detects immediately after the account is closed. This legislation, while not totally eliminating closed account adjustments, would provide some of the benefits discussed above while increasing the likelihood that DOD records relating to the closed account are more accurate. However, this option also presents some of the same payment and fund availability limitations discussed above. DOD has made significant improvements to its controls to identify and prevent illegal and otherwise improper closed account adjustments as evidenced by the 80 percent reduction of closed account adjustments during the first 6 months of fiscal year 2002. These short-term efforts serve as an example of what can be achieved when DOD takes prompt action to correct known problems through a strong top management commitment. At the same time, closed account adjustments are only a small fraction of the overall disbursement adjustments DOD makes each year as a result of its long-standing financial accounting and management problems. There are no quick fixes to the underlying problems, which must be dealt with over the long term. Nevertheless, there are some additional short-term actions that can be taken by focusing on simplifying accounting and contract payment allocation terms. Modernizing financial management systems, and improving the systems adherence to basic accounting requirements, will ultimately be key to DOD effectively resolving its financial management and contract payment problems. This will require a sustained commitment by DOD’s top management team over a number of years. We recommend that the Secretary of Defense direct the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller) to direct the Director of the Defense Finance and Accounting Service to help ensure that DFAS Columbus completes its review and correction of the remaining fiscal year 2000 illegal and otherwise improper adjustments, reverse closed account adjustments made during fiscal year 2001 identified in this report as illegal or otherwise improper, determine the entries necessary to correct the accounting for reversed fiscal year 2001 transactions, help ensure that DFAS Columbus completes the review and correction of the additional $1.1 billion of fiscal year 2001 adjustments it has scheduled for detailed review, and continue with DFAS’s top-level management attention and monitoring of the program for future adjustments to closed appropriation accounts. We also recommend that the Secretary of Defense direct the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller) to continue to monitor these adjustments so that any potential Antideficiency Act violations that may occur are promptly investigated and reported as required by the Antideficiency Act, 31 U.S.C. 1351, and implementing guidance. DOD agreed with our recommendations and outlined its ongoing and planned actions to identify, reverse, and correct illegal and otherwise improper fiscal year 2000 and 2001 closed appropriation account adjustments. DOD pointed out that this process may create adverse accounting conditions for a large number of contracts that will require either complete or partial reaudit to determine the correct accounting necessary to resolve the illegal or otherwise improper closed account adjustments we identified. For example, as we noted in our report, for one contract where DOD made a total of $590 million of closed account adjustments, we found that $210 million of the $590 million of adjustments were unnecessary and should not have been made because the actual disbursements had been recorded correctly. In order to reverse and correct the $210 million of unnecessary adjustments, DOD had to reverse the total $590 million in adjustments, which created other accounting errors that must now be researched and corrected. As our report noted, DOD estimates that it will take about 2,300 hours to resolve all the errors necessary to correct the $210 million of unnecessary adjustments we identified for this contract. DOD said it planned to have all its reaudits and corrective actions completed by September 30, 2004. DOD’s comments are reprinted in appendix II. We are sending copies of the report to interested congressional committees. We are also sending copies of this report to the Secretary of Defense; the Principal Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics; the Secretaries of the Army, Navy, and Air Force; the Director of the Defense Finance and Accounting Service; the Secretary of the Treasury; and the Director of the Office of Management and Budget. We will make copies available to others upon request. In addition, the report will be available at no charge on the GAO Web site at http://www.gao.gov. If you or your staffs have any questions regarding this report, please contact me at (202) 512-9505 or kutzg@gao.gov, or Larry W. Logsdon, Assistant Director, at (703) 695-7510 or logsdonl@gao.gov. Major contributors to this report are acknowledged in appendix III. To meet our first objective of monitoring DOD’s efforts to correct the problems we identified in our prior audit, we reviewed DFAS officials' corrective actions taken on 162 adjustments that we previously reported as $615 million of illegal or otherwise improper adjustments. As part of this review, we gathered vouchers that documented the reversal of the adjustments and analyzed financial information from DFAS Columbus’ records and reports, including contracts, contract modifications, shipping notices, invoices, payment vouchers, and schedules of adjustments. We identified and met with the DFAS Columbus officials knowledgeable about each reversed adjustment. We also identified the responsible DFAS or military service locations that maintained the official account records and obtained documentation to show how adjustments were reversed or corrected in the accounting records. To meet our second objective of determining if DOD experienced problems with adjustments to closed appropriation accounts in 2001 similar to the problems with the 2000 adjustments, we monitored DFAS Columbus’ review of $291 million of the $1.9 billion of closed account adjustments DOD reportedly made during fiscal year 2001. DFAS Columbus had already selected the $291 million of closed account adjustments for review at the time we began our audit. We took this approach rather than selecting a large number of adjustments for our own independent review because we knew that DOD had not fully implemented the controls necessary to identify and prevent fiscal year 2001 illegal and otherwise improper closed account adjustments. We reviewed the results of DFAS Columbus’ efforts and worked with staff members responsible for conducting the reviews to resolve any disagreements between DFAS and GAO on whether the documentation showed that the adjustments were legal and proper. As part of our analysis of DFAS Columbus’ reviews, we analyzed documentation supporting DFAS's detailed summaries for each adjustment to determine the reason for the adjustment and whether it was valid. For each adjustment, we reviewed the contract files for supporting hard copy documentation including modifications, invoices, payment vouchers, and MOCAS print screens. We also identified and met with the DFAS Columbus staff members who completed the reviews to discuss the reasons for the adjustments and resolve any differences of opinion between DFAS’s and our conclusions on whether the adjustments were legal and proper. To determine if DOD had implemented the effective system controls, which we identified in our prior report, to its contract reconciliation system to prevent illegal adjustments, we tested the CRS for two types of potentially illegal adjustments during a 6-month period. To do this, we independently analyzed the closed account adjustments included in the CRS database for the first 6 months of fiscal year 2002 to ascertain if CRS had processed any closed account adjustments that resulted in moving a disbursement charge (1) back to an appropriation that was canceled before the actual disbursement was made or (2) forward to an appropriation that had not yet been enacted at the time the actual disbursement was made. We met with responsible DFAS Columbus officials to discuss and resolve any transactions that our analysis identified as violations of either of these two measurements. In instances where there were violations, we met with DFAS Columbus personnel to determine why CRS controls had not prevented the transactions from processing and worked with DFAS’s staff to correct the system deficiencies. We did not validate the accuracy of the CRS database information pertaining to the disbursement dates or appropriations. To meet our third objective of determining why DOD makes so many adjustments to closed accounts, we reviewed the reconciliation summaries for the fiscal years 2000 and 2001 closed account adjustments that we reviewed in detail. We also met with the DFAS Columbus staff members who performed reconciliations to obtain their opinions on the primary reasons why errors occur. However, we did not determine the specific reasons why certain contracts have numerous ACRNs or how the detailed cost information was to be used. Finally, to determine options available to DOD and actions for the Congress to consider that would eliminate or reduce adjustments to closed appropriation accounts, we developed and presented options based on our reviews of fiscal year 2000 and 2001 closed account adjustments and discussions with DOD accounting and procurement officials. We performed our work primarily at the DFAS Center in Columbus, Ohio. We also obtained documentation from the following DFAS locations that were responsible for maintaining official accounting records: Cleveland, and Dayton, Ohio; Denver, Colorado; San Bernardino, California; and St. Louis, Missouri. Our review was conducted from June 2001 through April 2002 in accordance with U.S. generally accepted government auditing standards, except that we did not validate the accuracy of CRS information pertaining to the number of closed account adjustments and related dollar values.

The 1990 law provided that, 5 years after the expiration of the period of availability of a fixed-term appropriation, the appropriation account be closed and all remaining balances canceled. After closing, the appropriation account could no longer be used for obligations or expenditures for any purpose. DOD has started the process of correcting the illegal or improper closed account adjustments made during fiscal year 2000. However, this will require substantial effort and, according to DOD, estimates will not be complete before the end of fiscal year 2002. DOD had upgraded its system control features by the end of fiscal year 2001 to preclude many of the wholesale adjustments that GAO had previously identified. Because its system enhancements were done in stages, including some near the end of fiscal year 2001, DOD continued to make large amounts of illegal and otherwise improper closed account adjustments during the year. However, given the intensity of staff efforts to address these issues, it did not expect to complete the correct accounting for transactions found to be in error until September 2004. A lack of fundamental controls and management oversight over the closed accounts was the primary reason DOD was making so many closed account adjustments. DOD's action to resolve its problems with closed account adjustments is beginning to produce positive short-term results. However, if DOD fails to sustain these positive results, Congress could require DOD to validate and report to the Congress all closed account adjustments.",govreport
"The Internal Revenue Manual (IRM) describes the desired outcome of an income tax audit as the determination of the correct taxable income and tax liability of the person or entity under audit. In making these determinations, the auditor has a responsibility to both the audited taxpayer and all other taxpayers to conduct a quality audit. IRS uses nine audit standards, which have evolved since the 1960s, to define audit quality. These standards address several issues, such as the scope, techniques, technical conclusions, reports, and time management of an audit, as well as workpaper preparation. Each standard has one or more key elements. (See table I.1 in app. I for a list of these standards and their associated key elements.) Workpapers provide documentation on the scope of the audit and the diligence with which it was completed. According to the IRM, audit workpapers (1) assist in planning the audit; (2) record the procedures applied, tests performed, and evidence gathered; (3) provide support for technical conclusions; and (4) provide the basis for review by management. Audit workpapers also provide the principal support for the auditor’s report, which is to be provided to the audited taxpayer, on findings and conclusions about the taxpayer’s correct tax liability. The primary tool used by IRS to control quality under the nine standards is the review of ongoing audit work. This review is the responsibility of IRS’ first-line supervisors, called group managers, who are responsible for the quality of audits done by the auditors they manage. By reviewing audit workpapers during the audit, group managers attempt to identify problems with audit quality and ensure that the problems are corrected. After an audit closes, IRS uses its Examination Quality Measurement System (EQMS) to collect information about the audit process, changes to the process, level of audit quality, and success of any efforts to improve the process and quality. EQMS staff are to review audit workpapers and assess the degree to which the auditor complied with the audit standards. To pass a standard, the audit must pass all of the key elements. Our observations about the adequacy of the audit workpapers and supervisory review during audits are based on our work during 1996 and 1997 on IRS’ use of financial status audit techniques. Among other things, this work relied on a random sample of individual tax returns that IRS had audited. This sample excluded audits that were unlikely to use financial status audit techniques because the audit did not look at individual taxpayers’ books and records. Such excluded audits involved those done at service centers and those that only passed through various types of tax adjustments from other activities (e.g., partnership audits and refund claims). This random sample included 354 audits from a population of about 421,000 audits that were opened from October 1994 through October 1995 and closed in fiscal years 1995 or 1996. Each audit covered one or more individual income tax returns. The sample of audits from our previous work focused on the frequency in which IRS auditors used financial status audit techniques, rather than on the adequacy of audit workpapers. Consequently, we did not do the work necessary to estimate the extent to which workpapers met IRS’ workpaper standard for the general population of audits. However, our work did identify several cases in which audit workpapers in our sample did not meet IRS’ workpaper standard. We held follow-up discussions about the workpaper and supervisory review requirements, as well as about our observations, with IRS Examination Division officials. On the basis of these discussions, we agreed to check for documentation of group manager involvement by examining employee performance files for nine of our sample audits conducted out of IRS’ Northern California District Office to get a better idea of how the group managers handle their audit inventories and ensure quality. According to IRS officials, these files may contain documentation on case reviews by group managers even though such documentation may not be in the workpapers. We requested comments on a draft of this report from the Commissioner of Internal Revenue. On March 27, 1998, we received written comments from IRS, which are summarized at the end of this letter and are reproduced in appendix II. These comments have been incorporated into the report where appropriate. We did our work at IRS headquarters in Washington, D.C., and at district offices and service centers in Fresno and Oakland, CA; Baltimore, MD; Philadelphia, PA; and Richmond, VA. Our work was done between January and March, 1998, in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. One of IRS’ audit standards covers audit workpapers. In general, IRS requires the audit workpapers to support the auditor’s conclusions that were reached during an audit. On the basis of our review of IRS’ audit workpapers, we found that IRS auditors did not always meet the requirements laid out under this workpaper standard. IRS’ workpaper standard requires that workpapers provide the principal support for the auditor’s report and document the procedures applied, tests performed, information obtained, and conclusions reached. The five key elements for this workpaper standard involve (1) fully disclosing the audit trail and techniques used; (2) being clear, concise, legible, and organized and ensuring that workpaper documents have been initialed, labeled, dated, and indexed; (3) ensuring that tax adjustments recorded in the workpapers agree with IRS Forms 4318 or 4700 and the audit report; (4) adequately documenting the audit activity records; and (5) appropriately protecting taxpayers’ rights to privacy and confidentiality. The following are examples of some of the problems we found during our review of IRS audit workpapers: Tax adjustments shown in the workpapers, summaries, and reports did not agree. For example, in one audit, the report sent to the taxpayer showed adjustments for dependent exemptions and Schedule A deductions. However, neither the workpaper summary nor the workpapers included these adjustments. In another audit, the workpaper summary showed adjustments of about $25,000 in unreported wages, but the report sent to the taxpayer showed adjustments of only about $9,000 to Schedule C expenses. Required documents or summaries were not always in the workpaper bundle. For example, we found instances of missing or incomplete activity records and missing workpaper summaries. Workpapers that were in the bundle were not always legible or complete. The required information that was missing included the workpaper number, tax year being audited, date of the workpaper, and auditor’s name or initials. Although we are unable to develop estimates of the overall quality of audit workpapers, IRS has historically found problems with the quality of its workpapers. This observation is supported by evaluations conducted as part of IRS’ EQMS, which during the past 6 years (1992-97) indicated that IRS auditors met all of the key elements of the workpaper standard in no more than 72 percent of the audits. Table 1 shows the percentage of audits reviewed under EQMS that met all the key elements of the workpaper standard. The success rate, as depicted in table 1, indicates whether all of the key elements within the standard were met. That is, if any one element is not met, the standard is not met. Another indicator of the quality of the audit workpapers is how often each element within a standard meets the criteria of that element. Table I.2 in appendix I shows this rate, which IRS calls the pass rate, for the key elements of the workpaper standard. Workpapers are an important part of the audit effort. They are a tool to use in formulating and documenting the auditor’s findings, conclusions, and recommended adjustments, if any. Workpapers are also used by third-party reviewers as quality control and measurement instruments. Documentation of the auditor’s methodology and support for the recommended tax adjustments are especially important when the taxpayer does not agree with the recommendations. In these cases, the workpapers are to be used to make decisions about how much additional tax is owed by the taxpayer. Inadequate workpapers may result in having the auditor do more work or even in having the recommended adjustment overturned. IRS’ primary quality control mechanism is supervisory review of the audit workpapers to ensure adherence to the audit standards. However, our review of the workpapers in the sampled audits uncovered limited documentation of supervisory review. As a result, the files lacked documentation that IRS group managers reviewed workpapers during the audits to help ensure that the recommended tax adjustments were supported and verified, and that the audits did not unnecessarily burden the audited taxpayers. The IRM requires that group managers review the audit work to assess quality and ensure that audit standards are being met, but it does not indicate how or when such reviews should be conducted. However, the IRM does not require that documentation of this review be maintained in the audit files. We found little documentation in the workpapers that group managers reviewed workpapers before sharing the audit results with the taxpayer. In analyzing the sampled audits, we recorded whether the workpapers contained documentation that a supervisor had reviewed the workpapers during the audit. We counted an audit as having documentation of being reviewed if the group manager made notations in the workpapers on the audit findings or results; we also counted audits in which the workpapers made some reference to a discussion with the group manager about the audit findings. On the basis of our analysis of the sampled audits closed during fiscal years 1995 and 1996, we estimated that about 6 percent of the workpapers in the sample population contained documentation of group manager review during the audits. In discussions about our estimate with IRS Examination Division officials, they noted that all unagreed audits (i.e., those audits in which the taxpayers do not agree with the tax adjustments) are to be reviewed by the group managers, and they pointed to the manager’s initials on the notice of deficiency as documentation of this review. We did not count reviews of these notices in our analysis because they occurred after IRS sent the original audit report to the taxpayer. If we assume that workpapers for all unagreed audits were reviewed, our estimate on the percentage of workpapers with documentation of being reviewed increases from 6 percent to about 26 percent. Further, we analyzed all unagreed audits in our sample to see how many had documentation of group manager review during the audit, rather than after the audit results were sent to the taxpayer; this would be the point at which the taxpayer either would agree or disagree with the results. We found documentation of such a review in 12 percent of the unagreed audits. The Examination Division officials also said that a group manager may review the workpapers without documentation of that review being recorded in the workpapers. Further, they said that group managers had limited time to review workpapers due to many other responsibilities. The officials also told us that group managers can be involved with audits through means other than review of the workpapers. They explained that these managers monitor their caseload through various processes, such as evaluations of auditors’ performance during or after an audit closes, monthly discussions with auditors about their inventory of audits, reviews of auditors’ time charges, reviews of audits that have been open the longest, and visits to auditors located outside of the district office. The Examination Division officials also noted that any time the audit is expanded, such as by selecting another of the taxpayer’s returns or adding a related taxpayer or return, this action must be approved by the group manager. According to these officials, these other processes may involve a review of audit workpapers, but not necessarily during the audit. We agreed that we would check for documentation of these other processes in our nine sample audits from IRS’ District Office located in Oakland. We found documentation of workload reviews for one of these nine sample audits. In these monthly workload reviews, supervisors are to monitor time charges to an audit. In one other audit, documentation showed that a special unit within the Examination Division reviewed and made changes to the form used to record data for input into IRS’ closed audits database. However, none of this documentation showed supervisory review of the audit workpapers. If any other forms of supervisory involvement with these audits had occurred, the documentation either had been removed from the employee performance file as part of IRS’ standard procedure or was not maintained in a way that we could relate it back to a specific taxpayer. As a result, we do not know how frequently these other processes for supervisory involvement occurred and whether substantive reviews of the audits were part of these processes. IRS is currently drafting changes to the IRM relating to workpapers. In the draft instructions, managers are required to document managerial involvement. This documentation may include signatures, notations in the activity record, or summaries of discussions in the workpapers. When completed, this section is to become part of the IRM’s section on examination of returns. According to an IRS official, comments from IRS’ field offices on the draft changes are not due into headquarters until May 1998. IRS audits tax returns to ensure that taxpayers pay the correct amount of tax. If auditors do quality work, IRS is more likely to meet this goal while minimizing the burden on taxpayers. Quality audits should also encourage taxpayers to comply voluntarily. Supervisory review during the audits is a primary tool in IRS’ efforts to control quality. IRS requires group managers to ensure the quality of the audits, leaving much discretion on the frequency and nature of their reviews during an audit. IRS officials noted that group managers are to review workpapers if taxpayers disagree with the auditor’s report on any recommended taxes. The IRM does not specifically require that all of these supervisory reviews be documented in the workpapers, even though generally accepted government auditing standards do require such documentation. However, recent draft changes to the IRM may address this issue by requiring such documentation. We found little documentation of such supervisory reviews, even though these reviews can help to avoid various problems. For example, supervisory review could identify areas that contribute to IRS’ continuing problems in creating audit workpapers that meet its standard for quality. Since fiscal year 1992, the quality of workpapers has been found wanting by IRS’ EQMS. Inadequately documented workpapers raise questions about whether supervisory review is controlling audit quality as intended. These questions cannot be answered conclusively, however, because the amount of supervisory review cannot be determined. The lack of documentation on workpaper review raises questions about the extent of supervisory involvement with the audits. Proposed changes to the IRM’s sections on examination of returns require documentation of management involvement in the audit process. We recommend that the IRS Commissioner require audit supervisors to document their review of audit workpapers as a control over the quality of audits and the associated workpapers. On March 25, 1998, we met with IRS officials to obtain comments on a draft of this report. These officials included the Acting Deputy Chief Compliance Officer, the Assistant Commissioner for Examination and members of his staff, and a representative from IRS’ Office of Legislative Affairs. IRS documented its comments in a March 27, 1998, letter from the IRS Commissioner, which we have reprinted in appendix II. In this letter, IRS agreed to make revisions to the IRM instructions for the purpose of implementing our recommendation by October 1998. The letter included an appendix outlining adoption plans. The IRS letter also expressed two concerns with our draft report. First, IRS said our conclusion about the lack of evidence of supervisory review of audit workpapers was somewhat misleading and pointed to examples of other managerial practices, such as on-the-job visitations, to provide oversight and involvement in cases. We do not believe our draft report was misleading. As IRS acknowledges in its letter, when discussing the lack of documentation of supervisory review, we also described these other managerial practices. Second, IRS was concerned that our draft report appeared to consider these other managerial practices insufficient. Our draft report did not discuss the sufficiency of these practices but focused on the lack of documentation of supervisory review, including these other managerial practices. We continue to believe that documentation of supervisory review of workpapers is needed to help ensure quality control over the workpapers and audits. At the March 25, 1998, meeting, IRS provided technical comments to clarify specific sections of the draft report that described IRS processes. IRS officials also discussed the distinction between supervisory review and documentation of that review. We have incorporated these comments into this report where appropriate. We are sending copies of this report to the Subcommittee’s Ranking Minority Member, the Chairmen and Ranking Minority Members of the House Ways and Means Committee and the Senate Committee on Finance, various other congressional committees, the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, the Secretary of the Treasury, the IRS Commissioner, and other interested parties. We will also make copies available to others upon request. Major contributors to this report are listed in appendix III. If you have any questions concerning this report, please contact me at (202) 512-9110. The Office of Compliance Specialization, within the Internal Revenue Service’s (IRS) Examination Division, has responsibility for Quality Measurement Staff operations and the Examination Quality Measurement System (EQMS). Among other uses, IRS uses EQMS to measure the quality of closed audits against nine IRS audit standards. The standards address the scope, audit techniques, technical conclusions, workpaper preparation, reports, and time management of an audit. Each standard includes additional key elements describing specific components of a quality audit. Table I.1 summarizes the standards and the associated key elements. Table I.1: Summary of IRS’ Examination Quality Measurement System Auditing Standards (as of Oct. 1996) Measures whether consideration was given to the large, unusual, or questionable items in both the precontact stage and during the course of the examination. This standard encompasses, but is not limited to, the following fundamental considerations: absolute dollar value, relative dollar value, multiyear comparisons, intent to mislead, industry/business practices, compliance impact, and so forth. Measures whether the steps taken verified that the proper amount of income was reported. Gross receipts were probed during the course of examination, regardless of whether the taxpayer maintained a double entry set of books. Consideration was given to responses to interview questions, the financial status analysis, tax return information, and the books and records in probing for unreported income. Measures whether consideration was given to filing and examination potential of all returns required by the taxpayer including those entities in taxpayer’s sphere of influence/responsibility. Required filing checks consist of the analysis of return information and, when warranted, the pick-up of related, prior and subsequent year returns. In accordance with Internal Revenue Manual 4034, examinations should include checks for filing information returns. (continued) Measures whether the issues examined were completed to the extent necessary to provide sufficient information to determine substantially correct tax. The depth of the examination was determined through inspection, inquiry, interviews, observation, and analysis of appropriate documents, ledgers, journals, oral testimony, third-party records, etc., to ensure full development of relevant facts concerning the issues of merit. Interviews provided information not available from documents to obtain an understanding of the taxpayer’s financial history, business operations, and accounting records in order to evaluate the accuracy of books/records. Specialists provided expertise to ensure proper development of unique or complex issues. Measures whether the conclusions reached were based on a correct application of tax law. This standard includes consideration of applicable law, regulations, court cases, revenue rulings, etc. to support technical/factual conclusions. Measures whether applicable penalties were considered and applied correctly. Consideration of the application of appropriate penalties during all examination is required. Measures the documentation of the examination’s audit trail and techniques used. Workpapers provided the principal support for the examiner’s report and documented the procedures applied, tests performed, information obtained, and the conclusions reached in the examination. Measures the presentation of the audit findings in terms of content, format, and accuracy. Addresses the written presentation of audit findings in terms of content, format, and accuracy. All necessary information is contained in the report, so that there is a clear understanding of the adjustments made and the reasons for those adjustments. Measures the utilization of time as it relates to the complete audit process. Time is an essential element of the Auditing Standards and is a proper consideration in analyses of the examination process. The process is considered as a whole and at examination initiation, examination activities, and case closing stages. (Table notes on next page) IRS uses the key element pass rate as one measure of audit quality. This measure computes the percentage of audits demonstrating the characteristics defined by the key element. According to IRS, the key element pass rate is the most sensitive measurement and is useful when describing how an audit is flawed, establishing a baseline for improvement, and identifying systemic changes. Table I.2 shows the pass rates for the key elements of the workpaper standard for fiscal years 1992 through 1997 for office and field audits.

GAO noted that: (1) during its review of IRS' financial status audits, the workpapers did not always meet the requirements under IRS' workpaper standards; (2) standards not met in some audit workpapers included the expectation that: (a) the amount of tax adjustments recorded in the workpapers would be the same as the adjustment amounts shown in the auditor's workpaper summary and on the report sent to the taxpayer; and (b) the workpaper files would contain all required documents to support conclusions about tax liability that an auditor reached and reported to the taxpayer; (3) these shortcomings with the workpapers are not new; (4) GAO found documentation on supervisory review of workpapers prepared during the audits in an estimated 6 percent of the audits in GAO's sample; (5) in the remaining audits, GAO found no documentation that the group managers reviewed either the support for the tax adjustments or the report communicating such adjustments to the taxpayer; (6) IRS officials indicated that all audits in which the taxpayer does not agree with the recommended adjustments are to be reviewed by the group managers; (7) if done, this review would occur after the report on audit results was sent to the taxpayer; (8) even when GAO counts all such unagreed audits, those with documentation of supervisory review would be an estimated 26 percent of the audits in GAO's sample population; (9) GAO believes that supervisory reviews and documentation of such reviews are important because they are IRS' primary quality control process; (10) proper reviews done during the audit can help ensure that audits minimize burden on taxpayers and that any adjustments to taxpayers' liabilities are supported; (11) although Examination Division officials recognized the need for proper reviews, they said IRS group managers cannot review workpapers for all audits because of competing priorities; (12) these officials also said that group managers get involved in the audit process in ways that may not be documented in the workpapers; (13) they stated that these group managers monitor auditors' activities through other processes, such as by reviewing the time that auditors spent on an audit, conducting on-the-job visits, and talking to auditors about their cases and audit inventory; and (14) in these processes, however, the officials said that group managers usually were not reviewing workpapers or validating the calculations used to recommend adjustments before sending the audit results to the taxpayer.",govreport
"There are two approaches for reorganizing or terminating a large financial company. Large financial companies may be reorganized or liquidated under a judicial bankruptcy process or resolved under special legal and regulatory resolution regimes that have been created to address insolvent financial entities such as insured depository institutions and insurance companies. Bankruptcy is a federal court procedure, the goal of which is to help individuals and businesses eliminate or restructure debts they cannot repay and help creditors receive some payment in an equitable manner. Generally the filing of a bankruptcy petition operates as an automatic stay; that is, it stops most lawsuits, foreclosures, and other collection activities against the debtor. Equitable treatment of creditors means all creditors with substantially similar claims are classified similarly and receive the same treatment. For example, a class of secured creditors— those with liens or other secured claims against the debtor’s property— will receive similar treatment as to their secured claims. Business debtors may seek liquidation, governed primarily by Chapter 7 of the Code, or reorganization, governed by Chapter 11. Proceedings under Chapters 7 and 11 can be voluntary (initiated by the debtor) or involuntary (generally initiated by at least three creditors holding at least a certain minimum amount of claims against the debtor). In an involuntary proceeding, the debtor can defend against the proceeding, including presenting objections. The judge subsequently decides whether to grant the creditors’ request and permit the bankruptcy to proceed, dismiss the request, or enter any other appropriate order. A Chapter 7 proceeding is a court-supervised procedure by which a trustee takes over the assets of the debtor’s estate subject to limited exemptions, reduces them to cash, and makes distributions to creditors, subject to the rights of secured creditors to the collateral securing their loans to the debtor. A reorganization proceeding under Chapter 11 allows debtors to continue some or all of their operations subject to court supervision as a way to satisfy creditor claims. The debtor typically remains in control of its assets, and is called a debtor-in-possession (DIP). Under certain circumstances, the court can direct the U.S. Trustee to appoint a Chapter 11 trustee to take over the affairs of the debtor. As shown in figure 1, a firm going through a Chapter 11 bankruptcy generally will pass through several stages. Among these are: First-day motions. The most common first-day motions relate to the continued operation of the debtor’s business and involve matters such as requests to use cash collateral—liquid assets on which secured creditors have a lien or claim—and obtaining financing, if any. Disclosure. The disclosure statement must include information on the debtor’s assets, liabilities, and business affairs sufficient to enable creditors to make informed judgments about how to vote on the debtor’s reorganization plan and must be approved by the bankruptcy court. Plan of reorganization. A debtor has an exclusive right to file a plan of reorganization within the first 120 days of bankruptcy. The plan describes how the debtor intends to reorganize and treat its creditors. The plan divides claims against the debtor into separate classes and specifies the treatment each class will receive. The court may confirm the plan if, among other things, each class of allowed creditors has accepted the plan or the class is not impaired by the plan. If not all classes of impaired creditors vote to accept the plan, the court can still confirm the plan if it is shown that it is fair to all impaired creditors. Reorganization. Possible outcomes, which can be used in combination, include (1) distribution under a plan of the proceeds of a pre-plan sale of the assets of the company (in whole or in part), sometimes called a section 363 sale. Section 363 of the Code permits sales that are free and clear of creditor claims of property of the estate; (2) liquidation of the company’s assets with approval of the court, through means other than a 363 sale; and (3) reorganization of the company, in which it emerges from bankruptcy with new contractual rights and obligations that replace or supersede those it had before filing for bankruptcy protection. The debtor, creditors, trustee, or other interested parties may initiate adversary proceedings—in effect, a lawsuit within the bankruptcy case to preserve or recover money or property, to subordinate a claim of another creditor to their own claims, or for similar reasons. Furthermore, the The U.S. bankruptcy system involves multiple federal entities. Bankruptcy courts are located in 90 federal judicial districts; however, as we reported in 2011, the Southern District of New York and the District of Delaware adjudicate a majority of larger corporate or business bankruptcy cases. The Judicial Conference of the United States serves as the judiciary’s principal policymaking body and recommends national policies on all aspects of federal judicial administration. In addition, AOUSC serves as the central administrative support entity for the Judicial Conference and the federal courts, including bankruptcy courts. The Federal Judicial Center is the education and research agency for the federal courts and assists bankruptcy courts with reports and assessments relating to the administration and management of bankruptcy cases. Finally, the Department of Justice’s U.S. Trustee Program and the judiciary’s Bankruptcy Administrator Program oversee bankruptcy trustees and promote integrity and efficiency in the bankruptcy system by overseeing the administration of bankruptcy estates. A preference action can be asserted for payments made to an insider within a year prior to the bankruptcy filing. Large, complex financial companies that are eligible to file for bankruptcy generally file under Chapter 11 of the Code. Such companies operating in the United States engage in a range of financial services activities. Many are organized under both U.S. and foreign laws. The U.S. legal structure is frequently premised on a parent holding company owning regulated subsidiaries (such as depository institutions, insurance companies, broker-dealers, and commodity brokers) and nonregulated subsidiaries that engage in financial activities. Certain financial institutions may not file as debtors under the Code and other entities face special restrictions in using the Code: Insured depository institutions. Under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, FDIC serves as the conservator or receiver for insured depository institutions placed into conservatorship or receivership under applicable law. Insurance companies. Insurers generally are subject to oversight by state insurance commissioners, who have the authority to place them into conservatorship, rehabilitation, or receivership. Broker-dealers. Broker-dealers can be liquidated under the Securities Investor Protection Act (SIPA) or under a special subchapter of Chapter 7 of the Code. However, broker-dealers may not file for reorganization under Chapter 11. Commodity brokers. Commodity brokers, which include futures commission merchants, foreign futures commission merchants, clearing organizations, and certain other entities in the derivatives industry, can only use a special subchapter of Chapter 7 for bankruptcy relief. Regulators often play a role in financial company bankruptcies. With the exception of CFTC and SEC, the Code does not explicitly name federal financial regulators as a party of interest with a right to be heard before the court. In practice, regulators frequently appear before the court in financial company bankruptcies. For example, as receiver of failed insured depository institutions, FDIC’s role in bankruptcies of bank holding companies is typically limited to that of creditor. CFTC has the express right to be heard and raise any issues in a case under Chapter 7. SEC has the same rights in a case under Chapter 11. SEC may become involved in a bankruptcy particularly if there are issues related to disclosure or the issuance of new securities. SEC and CFTC are, in particular, involved in Chapter 7 bankruptcies of broker-dealers and commodity brokers. In the event of a broker-dealer liquidation, pursuant to SIPA the bankruptcy court retains jurisdiction over the case and a trustee, selected by the Securities Investor Protection Corporation (SIPC), typically administers the case. SEC may participate in any SIPA proceeding as a party. The Code does not restrict the federal government from providing DIP financing to a firm in bankruptcy, and in certain cases it has provided such funding—for example, financing under the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) in the bankruptcies of General Motors and Chrysler. The authority to make new financial commitments under TARP terminated on October 3, 2010. In July 2010, the Dodd-Frank Act amended section 13(3) of the Federal Reserve Act to prohibit the establishment of an emergency lending program or facility for the purpose of assisting a single and specific company to avoid bankruptcy. Nevertheless, the Federal Reserve may design emergency lending programs or facilities for the purpose of providing liquidity to the financial system. Although the automatic stay generally preserves assets and prevents creditors from taking company assets in payment of debts before a case is resolved and assets are systematically distributed, the stay is subject to exceptions, one of which can be particularly important in a financial institution bankruptcy. These exceptions—commonly referred to as the “safe harbor provisions”—pertain to certain financial and derivative contracts, often referred to as qualified financial contracts (QFC). The types of contracts eligible for the safe harbors are defined in the Code. They include derivative financial products, such as forward contracts and swap agreements that financial companies (and certain individuals and nonfinancial companies) use to hedge against losses from other transactions or speculate on the likelihood of future economic developments. Repurchase agreements, which are collateralized instruments that provide short-term financing for financial companies and others, also generally receive safe-harbor treatment. Under the safe-harbor provisions, most counterparties that entered into a qualifying transaction with the debtor may exercise certain contractual rights even if doing so otherwise would violate the automatic stay. In the event of insolvency or the commencement of bankruptcy proceedings, the nondefaulting party in a QFC may liquidate, terminate, or accelerate the contract, and may offset (net) any termination value, payment amount, or other transfer obligation arising under the contract when the debtor files for bankruptcy. That is, generally nondefaulting counterparties subtract what they owe the bankrupt counterparty from what that counterparty owes them (netting), often across multiple contracts. If the result is positive, the nondefaulting counterparties can sell any collateral they are holding to offset what the bankrupt entity owes them. If that does not fully settle what they are owed, the nondefaulting counterparties are treated as unsecured creditors in any final liquidation or reorganization. OLA gives FDIC the authority, subject to certain constraints, to resolve large financial companies, including a bank holding company or a nonbank financial company designated for supervision by the Federal Reserve, outside of the bankruptcy process. This regulatory resolution authority allows for FDIC to be appointed receiver for a financial company if the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the President, determines, upon the recommendation of two-thirds of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve and (depending on the nature of the financial firm) FDIC, SEC, or the Director of the Federal Insurance Office, among other things, that the firm’s failure and its resolution under applicable law, including bankruptcy, would have serious adverse effects on U.S. financial stability and no viable private-sector alternative is available to prevent the default. In December 2013, FDIC released for public comment a notice detailing a proposed single-point-of-entry (SPOE) approach to resolving a systemically important financial institution under OLA. Under the SPOE approach, as outlined, FDIC would be appointed receiver of the top-tier U.S. parent holding company of a covered financial company determined to be in default or in danger of default pursuant to the appointment process set forth in the Dodd-Frank Act. Immediately after placing the parent holding company into receivership, FDIC would transfer assets (primarily the equity and investments in subsidiaries) from the receivership estate to a bridge financial company. By allowing FDIC to take control of the firm at the parent holding company level, this approach could allow subsidiaries (domestic and foreign) carrying out critical services to remain open and operating. In a SPOE resolution, at the parent holding company level, shareholders would be wiped out, and unsecured debt holders would have their claims written down to reflect any losses that shareholders cannot cover. The resolution of globally active large financial firms is often associated with complex international, legal, and operational challenges. The resolution of failed financial companies is subject to different national frameworks. During the recent financial crisis, these structural challenges led to government rescues or disorderly liquidations of systemic firms. Insolvency laws vary widely across countries. The legal authorities of some countries are not designed to resolve problems in financial groups operating through multiple legal entities that span borders. Some resolution authorities may not encourage cooperative solutions with foreign resolution authorities. Regulatory and legal regimes may conflict. Depositor preference, wholesale funding arrangements, derivatives, and repurchase agreements are often treated differently among countries when a firm enters bankruptcy. Some resolution authorities may lack the legal tools or authority to share information with relevant foreign authorities about the financial group as a whole or subsidiaries or branches. Country resolution authorities may have as their first responsibility the protection of domestic financial stability and minimization of any risk to public funds. For instance, if foreign authorities did not have full confidence that national and local interests would be protected, the assets of affiliates or branches of a U.S.-based financial institution chartered in other countries could be ring fenced or isolated and wound down separately under the insolvency laws of other countries thus complicating home-country resolution efforts. In 2005, the United States adopted Chapter 15 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. Chapter 15 is based on the Model Law on Cross-Border Insolvency of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL). The model law is intended to promote coordination between courts in different countries during insolvencies and has been adopted in 21 jurisdictions. More than 450 Chapter 15 cases have been filed since its adoption, with more than half filed in the Southern District of New York and the District of Delaware. Among the stated objectives of Chapter 15 are promoting cooperation between U.S. and foreign parties involved in a cross-border insolvency case, providing for a fair process that protects all creditors, and facilitating the rescue of a distressed firm. In pursuit of these goals, Chapter 15 authorizes several types of coordination, including U.S. case trustees or other authorized entities operating in foreign countries on behalf of a U.S. bankruptcy estate; foreign representatives having direct access to U.S. courts, including the right to commence a proceeding or seek recognition of a foreign proceeding; and U.S. courts communicating information they deem important, coordinating the oversight of debtors’ activities, and coordinating proceedings. Chapter 15 excludes the same financial institutions that are generally not eligible to file as debtors under the Code (such as insured depository institutions and U.S. insurance companies), with the exception of foreign insurance companies. It also excludes broker-dealers that can be liquidated under SIPA or a special provision of Chapter 7 of the Code and commodity brokers that can be liquidated under a different special provision of Chapter 7. Based on the UNCITRAL model law, Chapter 15 contains a public policy exception that allows a U.S. court to refuse cooperation and coordination if doing so would be “manifestly contrary to the public policy of the United States.” Since we last reported on financial company bankruptcies in July 2013, no changes have been made to Chapters 7, 11, or 15 of the Bankruptcy Code relating to large financial companies, although two bills were introduced in the 113th Congress that would have attempted to address challenges associated with the reorganization of large financial firms as governed by Chapter 11 of the Code. Neither bill was signed into law nor re-introduced in the current Congress, as of March 12, 2015. The Taxpayer Protection and Responsible Resolution Act (S. 1861) was introduced in the Senate on December 19, 2013. The bill would have added a new chapter to the Code—”Chapter 14: Liquidation, Reorganization, or Recapitalization of a Covered Financial Corporation”— that would have generally applied to bank holding companies or corporations predominantly engaged in activities that the Federal Reserve Board has determined are financial in nature. Its provisions would have made changes to the role of regulators, changed the treatment of QFCs, and specifically designated judges to hear Chapter 14 cases, as the following examples illustrate. The proposal would have repealed the regulatory resolution regime in Title II of the Dodd-Frank Act—revoking FDIC’s role as a receiver of a failed or failing financial company under OLA—and returned all laws changed by Title II to their pre-Title II state. The proposal would have allowed the Federal Reserve Board to commence an involuntary bankruptcy and granted the Federal Reserve Board the right to be heard before the court. The proposal would have allowed the court to transfer assets of the estate to a bridge company (on request of the Federal Reserve Board or the trustee and after notice and hearing and not less than 24 hours after the start of the case). The court would have been able to order transfer of assets to a bridge company only under certain conditions (including that a preponderance of evidence indicated the transfer was necessary to prevent imminent substantial harm to U.S. financial stability). FDIC also would have been granted the right to be heard before the court on matters related to the transfer of property to the bridge company. However, this proposal would have explicitly prohibited the Federal Reserve Board from providing DIP financing to a company in bankruptcy or to a bridge company and provided no specific alternative non-market source of funding. The Taxpayer Protection and Responsible Resolution Act (S. 1861) also would have changed the treatment of QFCs in bankruptcy. The rights to liquidate, terminate, offset, or net QFCs would have been stayed for up to 48 hours after bankruptcy filing (or the approval of the petition from the Federal Reserve Board). During the stay, the trustee would have been able to perform all payment and delivery obligations under the QFC that became due after the case commenced. The stay would have been terminated if the trustee failed to perform any payment or delivery obligation. Furthermore, QFCs would not have been able to be transferred to the bridge company unless the bridge assumed all contracts with a counterparty. If transferred to the bridge company, the QFCs could not have been terminated or modified for certain reasons, including the fact that a bankruptcy filing occurred. Aside from the limited exceptions, QFC counterparties would have been free to exercise all of their pre-existing contractual rights, including termination. Finally, the Taxpayer Protection and Responsible Resolution Act (S. 1861) would have required the Chief Justice to designate no fewer than 10 bankruptcy judges with expertise in cases under Title 11 in which a financial institution is a debtor to be available to hear a Chapter 14 case. Additionally, the Chief Justice would have been required to designate at least one district judge from each circuit to hear bankruptcy appeals under Title 11 concerning a covered financial corporation. A second bankruptcy reform proposal, the Financial Institution Bankruptcy Act of 2014 (H.R. 5421), was passed by voice vote by the House of Representatives on December 1, 2014, and would have added a new Subchapter V under Chapter 11. Generally, the proposed subchapter would have applied to bank holding companies or corporations with $50 billion or greater in total assets and whose activities, along with its subsidiaries, are primarily financial in nature. The Financial Institution Bankruptcy Act (H.R. 5421) contained provisions similar or identical to those in the Taxpayer Protection and Responsible Resolution Act (S. 1861) that would have affected the role of regulators, treatment of QFCs, and designation of judges. For example, this proposal would have allowed an involuntary bankruptcy to be commenced by the Federal Reserve Board and allowed for the creation of a bridge company to which assets of the debtor holding company could be transferred. This proposal also would have granted the Federal Reserve Board and FDIC the right to be heard before the court, as well as the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and SEC (which are not granted this right under the Taxpayer Protection and Responsible Resolution Act). The changes to the treatment of QFCs under this proposal were substantively similar to those under the Taxpayer Protection and Responsible Resolution Act (S. 1861). In addition, the Financial Institution Bankruptcy Act (H.R. 5421) would have required that the Chief Justice would designate no fewer than 10 bankruptcy judges to be available to hear a Subchapter V case. The Chief Justice also would have been required to designate not fewer than three judges of the court of appeals in not fewer than four circuits to serve on an appellate panel. Although the two bills have similarities, there are significant differences. For example, the Financial Institution Bankruptcy Act (H.R. 5421) would not have repealed Title II of the Dodd-Frank Act. Instead, Title II would have remained an alternative to resolving a firm under the Bankruptcy Code. Also, the Financial Institution Bankruptcy Act (H.R. 5421) would not have restricted the Federal Reserve Board from providing DIP financing to a financial firm under the proposed subchapter. Furthermore, the Financial Institution Bankruptcy Act (H.R. 5421) would have given the court broad power in the confirmation of the bankruptcy plan to consider the serious adverse effect that any decision in connection with Subchapter V might have on financial stability in the United States. By contrast, the Taxpayer Protection and Responsible Resolution Act (S. 1861) mentioned financial stability as a consideration in specific circumstances, such as whether the Federal Reserve Board could initiate an involuntary bankruptcy under Chapter 14, or whether the court could order a transfer of the debtor’s property to the bridge company. Certain provisions in these bills resembled those in OLA and may have facilitated a resolution strategy similar to FDIC’s SPOE strategy under OLA. For example, each of the bankruptcy reform bills and FDIC’s SPOE strategy under OLA would have allowed for the creation of a bridge company, in which assets, financial contracts, and some legal entities of the holding company would have been transferred, allowing certain subsidiaries to have maintained operations. In addition, OLA, like the bills, included a temporary stay for QFCs. OLA uses a regulatory approach to resolution, while the bankruptcy reform bills in the 113th Congress would have maintained a judicial approach to resolution. Some experts have expressed concern that a regulatory resolution may not adequately ensure the creditors’ rights to due process. For example, experts attending GAO’s 2013 bankruptcy reform roundtables noted that if preferences were given to some counterparties or creditors during a temporary stay, other counterparties or creditors would have the right to take action to recover value later in the process, as opposed to having a judge consider the views of all of the parties prior to making any decisions. However, as we reported in July 2013, other experts have stated that the judicial process of bankruptcy does not contemplate systemic risk, or have some of the tools available for minimizing the systemic risk associated with the failure of a systemically important financial institution. For example, to act quickly in cases involving large and complex financial companies, courts might need to shorten notice periods and limit parties’ right to be heard, which could compromise due process and creditor rights. In the United States, the judicial process under bankruptcy remains the presumptive method for resolving financial institutions, even those designated as systemically important. A third proposal would have more narrowly amended the Code. The 21st Century Glass-Steagall Act of 2013 (S. 1282 in the Senate and H.R. 3711 in the House) contained a provision that would have repealed all safe- harbor provisions for QFCs. This legislative proposal was neither signed into law nor re-introduced in the current Congress, as of March 12, 2015. Some experts have identified the safe-harbor treatment of QFCs under the Code as a challenge to an orderly resolution in bankruptcy. For example, safe-harbor treatment can create significant losses to the debtor’s estate, particularly for financial institution debtors that often are principal users of these financial products. As we previously reported in July 2011, some experts we interviewed suggested that modifying the safe harbor provisions might help to avoid or mitigate the precipitous decline of the asset values typical in financial institution bankruptcies. For example, these experts suggested that the treatment of QFCs in the Lehman bankruptcy contributed to a significant and rapid loss of asset values to the estate. Other experts we spoke with in 2011 suggested that safe-harbor treatment might lessen market discipline. Because counterparties entered into QFCs may close out their contracts even if doing so would otherwise violate the automatic stay, the incentive to monitor the risk of each other could be reduced. Additionally, as we reported in July 2013, attendees of our roundtable discussions on bankruptcy reform noted that the safe harbors lead to a larger derivatives market and greater reliance on short-term funding because QFCs would not be subject to a stay, which could increase systemic risk in the financial system. However, others argue that a repeal of the safe-harbor provisions could have adverse effects. As we previously reported in July 2011, these experts assert that subjecting any QFCs to the automatic stay in bankruptcy would freeze many assets of the counterparties of the failed financial institution, causing a chain reaction and a subsequent systemic financial crisis. In January 2011, regulatory officials we spoke with also told us that the safe harbor provisions uphold market discipline through margin, capital, and collateral requirements. They said that the requirement for posting collateral limits the amount of risk counterparties are willing to undertake. In addition, during the 2013 expert roundtable on financial company bankruptcies, one expert noted that one of the goals of safe harbors is to limit market turmoil during a bankruptcy—that is, they are to prevent the insolvency of one firm from spreading to other firms. In the United States the presumptive mechanism to resolve a failed cross- border large financial company continues to be through the judicial bankruptcy process, though no statutory changes have been made to Chapter 15 of the Code or the U.S. judicial bankruptcy process to address impediments to an orderly resolution of a large, multinational financial institution. However, while some structural challenges discussed earlier remain, others, such as conflicting regulatory regimes and the treatment of cross-border derivatives, are being addressed through various efforts. For example, the Federal Reserve and FDIC have taken certain regulatory actions mandated by the Dodd-Frank Act authorities toward facilitating orderly resolution, including efforts that could contribute to cross-border coordination. Specifically, certain large financial companies must provide the Federal Reserve and FDIC with periodic reports of their plans for rapid and orderly resolution in the event of material financial distress or failure under the Code. The resolution plans or living wills are to demonstrate how a company could be resolved in a rapid manner under the Code. FDIC and the Federal Reserve have said that the plans were expected to address potential obstacles to global cooperation, among others. In 2014, FDIC and the Federal Reserve sent letters to a number of large financial companies identifying specific shortcomings with the resolution plans that those firms will need to address in their 2015 submissions, due on or before July 1, 2015, for the first group of filers. International bodies have also focused on strengthening their regulatory structures to enable the orderly resolution of a failing large financial firm and have taken additional actions to facilitate cross-border resolutions. In October 2011, the Financial Stability Board (FSB)—an international body that monitors and makes recommendations about the global financial system—issued a set of principles to guide the development of resolution regimes for financial firms active in multiple countries. For example, each jurisdiction should have the authority to exercise resolution powers over firms, jurisdictions should have policies in place so that authorities are not reliant on public bailout funds, and statutory mandates should encourage a cooperative solution with foreign authorities. In addition, in December 2013 the European Parliament and European Council reached agreement on the European Union’s (EU) Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive, which establishes requirements for national resolution frameworks for all EU member states and provides for resolution powers and tools. For example, member states are to appoint a resolution authority, institutions must prepare and maintain recovery plans, resolution authorities are to assess the extent to which firms are resolvable without the assumption of extraordinary financial support, and authorities are to cooperate effectively when dealing with the failure of cross-border banks. Unlike the United States, EU and FSB do not direct resolution authorities to use the bankruptcy process developed for corporate insolvency situations. In a letter to the International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) in 2013, FDIC, the Bank of England, BaFin in Germany, and the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority called for changes in the exercise of termination rights and other remedies in derivatives contracts following commencement of an insolvency or resolution action. In October 2014, 18 major global financial firms agreed to sign a new ISDA Resolution Stay Protocol to facilitate the cross-border resolution of a large, complex institution. This protocol was published and these 18 financial firms agreed to it on November 12, 2014, and certain provisions of which became effective in January 2015. Generally, parties adhering to this protocol have agreed to be bound by certain limitations on their termination rights and other remedies in the event one of them becomes subject to certain resolution proceedings, including OLA. These stays are intended to give resolution authorities and insolvency administrators time to facilitate an orderly resolution of a troubled financial firm. The Protocol also incorporates certain restrictions on creditor contractual rights that would apply when a U.S. financial holding company becomes subject to U.S. bankruptcy proceedings, including a stay on cross-default rights that would restrict the counterparty of a non-bankrupt affiliate of an insolvent U.S. financial holding company from immediately terminating its derivatives contracts with that affiliate. Finally, a United Nations working group (tasked with furthering adoption of the UNCITRAL Model Law) included the insolvency of large and complex financial institutions as part of its focus on cross-border insolvency. In 2010, Switzerland proposed that the working group study the feasibility of developing an international instrument for the cross- border resolution of large and complex financial institutions. The working group has acknowledged and has been monitoring the work undertaken by FSB, Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, the International Monetary Fund, and EU. We provided a draft of this report to AOUSC, CFTC, Departments of Justice and the Treasury, FDIC, Federal Reserve, and SEC for review and comment. The agencies did not provide written comments.

In our July 2011 and July 2012 reports on the bankruptcy of financial companies, we reported on the status of the bankruptcy proceedings of, among other financial companies, Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., MF Global, and Washington Mutual. In the 2011 report, we found that comprehensive data on the number of financial companies in bankruptcies were not readily available. We collected information to update the status of the bankruptcy proceedings for Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., MF Global, and Washington Mutual. Since we last reported in July 2012, in each case, additional payments to creditors have been distributed and litigation with various parties is ongoing. Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. (Lehman) was an investment banking institution that offered equity, fixed-income, trading, asset management, and other financial services. In 2008, Lehman was the fourth largest U.S. investment bank and had been in operation since 1850. It had 209 registered subsidiaries in 21 countries. On September 15, 2008, Lehman filed Chapter 11 cases in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court. Its affiliates filed for bankruptcy over subsequent months. Some of Lehman’s affiliates also filed bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings in foreign jurisdictions. There are three different legal proceedings involving (1) the holding company or LBHI, (2) the U.S. broker dealer or LBI, and (3) the U.K. broker dealer or LBIE. On September 19, 2008, Lehman’s broker-dealer was placed into liquidation under the Securities Investor Protection Act (SIPA). The bankruptcy court approved the sale of LBI’s assets to Barclays PLC on September 20, 2008—5 days after the filing of the LBHI Chapter 11 case. In March 2010, LBHI debtors filed their proposed Chapter 11 plan. In December 2010, a group of senior creditors filed an alternative plan. Since then, various plan amendments and counter plans were filed. In December 2011, the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York confirmed a reorganization plan for LBHI and the plan took effect in March 2012. LBHI had more than 100,000 creditors. As of October 2, 2014, some $8.6 billion had been distributed to LBHI creditors in the nonpriority unsecured claims class. The Trustee of LBI has distributed more than $106 billion to 111,000 customers. As of September 2014, £34 billion has been distributed by the LBIE Administrator to counterparties in the House Estate (general unsecured estate) and the Trust Estate (Client Assets, Client Money and Omnibus Trust). In February 2015, the bankruptcy court approved a second interim distribution of $2.2 billion to general unsecured creditors with allowed claims. This would bring the total distributions to allowed general unsecured creditors to approximately 27 percent. There is ongoing litigation involving a breach of a swap with Giants Stadium, the payment of creditor committee members’ legal fees, and transactions with foreign entities, according to an official of the U.S. Trustees Program. Litigation concerning issues surrounding the sale of LBI assets to Barclays PLC also continues. On December 15, 2014, the SIPA Trustee filed a petition for a writ of certiorari with the U.S. Supreme Court seeking review of the lower court rulings that awarded $4 billion of margin cash assets to Barclay’s. MF Global Holdings Ltd. (MFGH) was one of the world’s leading brokers in markets for commodities and listed derivatives. The firm was based in the United States and had operations in Australia, Canada, Hong Kong, India, Japan, Singapore, and the U.K. On October 31, 2011, MFGH and one of its affiliates filed Chapter 11 cases in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York. In the months following four other affiliates filed for relief in Bankruptcy Court. Also, on October 31, 2011, the Securities Investor Protection Corporation (SIPC) commenced a SIPA case against MF Global’s broker-dealer subsidiary (MFGI). The SIPA trustee has been liquidating the firm’s assets and distributing payments to its customers on a rolling basis pursuant to a claims resolution procedure approved by the bankruptcy court overseeing the case. MFGI was required to pay $1.2 billion in restitution to its customers as well as a $100 million penalty. In December 2014, CFTC obtained a federal court consent order against MFGH requiring it to pay $1.2 billion or the amount necessary in restitution to ensure the claims of MFGI are paid in full. The bankruptcy court confirmed a liquidation plan for MFGH on April 22, 2013, which became effective in June 2013. As of the end of 2013, the SIPA trustee reported the probability of a 100 percent recovery of allowed net equity claims for all commodities and securities customers of MFGI. As of mid-December 2014, 100 percent of the distributions through the SIPA trustee have been completed to substantially all categories of commodities and securities customers and 39 percent of the first interim distribution on allowed unsecured claims. The trustee started to make $551 million in distributions to general creditors on October 30, 2014. An interim payment of $518.7 million went to unsecured general claimants and covered 39 percent of their allowed claims. A reserve fund of $289.8 million was to be held for unresolved unsecured claims and a reserve fund of $9.9 million will be held for unresolved priority claims. In April 2014, the SIPA trustee began final distributions to all public customers. With this distribution a total of $6.7 billion was to have been returned to over 26,000 securities and commodities futures customers. General creditor claims totaling more than $23 billion in asserted amounts, as substantial unliquidated claims, were filed in this proceeding as of the end of June 2014. As of December 2014, the SIPA trustee reports that of 7,687 general creditor claims asserted or reclassified from customer status, only 23 claims remain unresolved. Current litigation surrounds a malpractice complaint against PricewaterhouseCoopers (the company’s former auditor) and an investigation of the officers, according to an official of the U.S. Trustees Program. Washington Mutual Inc. was a thrift holding company that had 133 subsidiaries. Its subsidiary Washington Mutual Bank was the largest savings and loan association in the United State prior to its failure. In the 9 days prior to receivership by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), there were more than $16.7 billion in depositor withdrawals. At the time of its filing, Washington Mutual had about $32.9 billion in total assets and total debt of about $8.1 billion. Its failure was the largest bank failure in U.S. history. On September 25, 2008, the Office of Thrift Supervision found Washington Mutual Bank to be unsafe and unsound, closed the bank, and appointed FDIC as the receiver. FDIC as receiver then took possession of the bank’s assets and liabilities and transferred substantially all the assets and liabilities to JPMorgan Chase for $1.9 billion. On September 26, 2008, Washington Mutual and its subsidiary WMI Investment Corporation filed Chapter 11 cases in U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware. On March 12, 2010, Washington Mutual, FDIC, and JPMorgan Chase announced that they had reached a settlement on disputed property and claims. This was called the global settlement. On July 28, 2010, the bankruptcy court approved the appointment of an examiner, selected by the U.S. Trustee’s office, to investigate the claims of various parties addressed by the global settlement. The seventh amended plan was confirmed by the court on February 24, 2012. The plan established a liquidating trust—the Washington Mutual Liquidating Trust (WMILT)—to make subsequent distributions to creditors on account of their allowed claims. Upon the effective date of the plan, Washington Mutual became a newly reorganized company, WMI Holdings Corp. consisting primarily of its subsidiary WMI Mortgage Reinsurance Company, Inc. In 2012, there was an initial distribution of $6.5 billion. Since that initial distribution, an additional $660 million has been distributed to creditors, according to officials at the U.S. Trustees Program, including a distribution of $78.4 million paid on August 1, 2014. In August 2013, WMILT, pursuant to an order by the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware, filed a declaratory judgment in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington against FDIC, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Federal Reserve), and 90 former employees who were also claimants in the bankruptcy proceeding. Certain employee claimants have asserted cross-claims against FDIC and the Federal Reserve, contending that the banking agencies are without authority to assert limits on payment from troubled institutions that are contingent on termination of a person’s employment over WMILT, because WMILT is a liquidating trust. After the case was transferred to the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware in July 2014 and all pending motions terminated, most of the parties stipulated to withdraw the reference to the bankruptcy court. FDIC moved to dismiss the complaint on September 5, 2014. The proposed order to withdraw the reference and the briefing on the motion to dismiss remains pending. Section 202(e) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd Frank Act) mandated that we report on the orderliness and efficiency of financial company bankruptcies every year for 3 years after passage of the act, in the fifth year, and every 5 years thereafter. This report, the fourth in the series, examines (1) recent changes to the U.S. Bankruptcy Code (Code) and (2) efforts to improve cross-border coordination to facilitate the liquidation and reorganization of failed large financial companies under bankruptcy. For each of our objectives, we reviewed relevant regulations and laws, including the Code and the Dodd-Frank Act as well as GAO reports that addressed bankruptcy issues and financial institution failures. We specifically reviewed the reports we issued during the first 3 years of the mandate as well as reports written under the same or similar mandates by the Administrative Office of the United States Courts (AOUSC) and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Federal Reserve). We interviewed officials from the following federal agencies due to their role in financial regulation and bankruptcy proceedings: AOUSC; the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC); Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC); Department of Justice; Department of the Treasury (Treasury), including officials who support the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC); Federal Reserve; and Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). We also updated our review of published economic and legal research on the financial company bankruptcies that we had originally completed during the first year of the mandate (see appendix I). For the original search, we relied on Internet search databases (including EconLit and Proquest) to identify studies published or issued after 2000 through 2010. To address our first objective, we reviewed Chapters 7, 11, or 15 of the Bankruptcy Code for any changes. In addition, we reviewed legislation proposed in the 113th Congress that would change the Code for financial company bankruptcies. We also reviewed academic literature on financial company bankruptcies and regulatory resolution, transcripts of congressional hearings on bankruptcy reform, and transcripts from expert roundtables on bankruptcy reform that were hosted by GAO in 2013. To address our second objective, we reviewed Chapter 15 of the Bankruptcy Code, which relates to coordination between U.S. and foreign jurisdictions in bankruptcy cases in which the debtor is a company with foreign operations, for any changes. In addition, we sought information on U.S. and international efforts to improve coordination of cross-border resolutions from the federal agencies we interviewed. We also reviewed and analyzed documentary information from the Bank of England, Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, European Union, the Financial Stability Board, BaFin in Germany, International Monetary Fund, Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority, and the United Nations. To update the three bankruptcy cases of Lehman Brothers Holdings, Inc.; MF Global Holdings, Ltd.; and Washington Mutual, Inc. discussed in our July 2011 and July 2012 reports, we sought available information—for example, trustee reports and reorganization plans—on these cases from CFTC, FDIC, Federal Reserve, and SEC; AOUSC, the Department of Justice, and Treasury. In addition, we collected information from prior GAO reports, bankruptcy court documents, and the trustees in each case. To determine whether there were new bankruptcy filings of large financial companies such as those in our case studies, we inquired of AOUSC, CFTC, FDIC, Department of Justice, Treasury, Federal Reserve, and SEC. We also conducted a literature review, which did not show evidence of any new bankruptcy cases filed by large financial companies. We conducted this performance audit from June 2014 to March 2015 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. In addition to the individual named above, Karen Tremba, Assistant Director; Nancy S. Barry; Patrick Dynes; Risto Laboski; Marc Molino; Barbara Roesmann; Jessica Sandler; and Jason Wildhagen made key contributions to this report.

The Dodd-Frank Act mandates that GAO report on an ongoing basis on ways to make the U.S. Bankruptcy Code more effective in resolving certain failed financial companies. GAO has issued three reports on this issue. This fourth report addresses (1) recent changes to the U.S. Bankruptcy Code and (2) efforts to improve cross-border coordination to facilitate the liquidation or reorganization of failed large financial companies under bankruptcy. GAO reviewed laws, court documents, regulations, prior GAO reports, and academic literature on financial company bankruptcies and regulatory resolution. GAO also reviewed documentation from foreign financial regulators and international bodies such as the Financial Stability Board. GAO interviewed officials from the Administrative Office of the United States Courts, Department of Justice, Department of the Treasury, and financial regulators with a role in bankruptcy proceedings. GAO makes no recommendations in this report. The Department of the Treasury, Federal Reserve, FDIC, and the Securities and Exchange Commission provided technical comments on a draft of the report that GAO incorporated as appropriate. The U.S. Bankruptcy Code (Code) chapters dealing with the liquidation or reorganization of a financial company have not been changed since GAO last reported on financial company bankruptcies in July 2013. However, bills introduced in the previous Congress would, if re-introduced and passed, make broad changes to the Code relevant to financial company bankruptcies. The Financial Institution Bankruptcy Act of 2014 (H.R. 5421) and Taxpayer Protection and Responsible Resolution Act (S.1861) would have expanded to varying degrees the powers of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Federal Reserve) and Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and would have imposed a temporary stay on financial derivatives (securities whose value is based on one or more underlying assets) that are exempt from the automatic stay under the Code. That stay would prohibit a creditor from seizing or taking other action to collect what the creditor is owed under the financial derivative. The bills also would have added to the Code processes for the resolution of large, complex financial companies similar in some ways to provisions currently in the Orderly Liquidation Authority (OLA) in Title II of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act), which grants FDIC the authority to resolve failed systemically important financial institutions under its receivership. For example, each bill would have allowed for the creation of a bridge company, in which certain assets and financial contracts of the holding-company would be transferred, allowing certain subsidiaries to continue their operations. The 21st Century Glass-Steagall Act of 2013—a bill introduced in the House of Representatives (H.R. 3711) and the Senate (S. 1282)—would have repealed safe-harbor provisions that allow most counterparties in a qualifying transaction with the debtor to exercise certain contractual rights even if doing so would otherwise violate the automatic stay. As of March 12, 2015, these legislative proposals had not been re-introduced in Congress. In the United States, the presumptive mechanism to resolve a failed large financial company with cross-border operations is through the judicial bankruptcy process. Since GAO's 2013 report, no changes have been made to the chapter of the Code that relates to coordination between U.S. and foreign jurisdictions in bankruptcy cases in which the debtor has foreign operations. Some structural challenges remain, such as conflicting regulatory regimes related to the treatment of financial contracts between parties in different countries when a firm enters bankruptcy, but efforts are underway to address them. Regulators have implemented a Dodd-Frank Act provision that requires certain large financial firms to submit a resolution plan to assist with an orderly bankruptcy process, which regulators expect to help address potential problems with international cooperation, among others. However, in 2014, FDIC and the Federal Reserve identified shortcomings with the plans for a number of large financial companies that those firms are to address in their 2015 submissions. Further, international bodies, such as the Financial Stability Board—an international body that monitors and makes recommendations about the global financial system—have focused on having countries adopt a regulatory approach to resolutions. Other recent actions include a January 2015 stay protocol for derivatives contracts developed by the International Swaps and Derivatives Association that is intended to give regulators time to facilitate an orderly resolution of a troubled firm.",govreport
"The electricity industry, as shown in figure 1, is composed of four distinct functions: generation, transmission, distribution, and system operations. Once electricity is generated—whether by burning fossil fuels; through nuclear fission; or by harnessing wind, solar, geothermal, or hydro energy—it is generally sent through high-voltage, high-capacity transmission lines to local electricity distributors. Once there, electricity is transformed into a lower voltage and sent through local distribution lines for consumption by industrial plants, businesses, and residential consumers. Because electric energy is generated and consumed almost instantaneously, the operation of an electric power system requires that a system operator constantly balance the generation and consumption of power. Utilities and others own and operate electricity assets, which may include generation plants, transmission lines, distribution lines, and substations— structures often seen in residential and commercial areas that contain technical equipment such as switches and transformers to ensure smooth, safe flow of current and regulate voltage. Utilities may be owned by investors, municipalities, and individuals (as in cooperative utilities). System operators—sometimes affiliated with a particular utility or sometimes independent and responsible for multiple utility areas— manage the electricity flows. These system operators manage and control the generation, transmission, and distribution of electric power using control systems—IT- and network-based systems that monitor and control sensitive processes and physical functions, including opening and closing circuit breakers. As we have previously reported, the effective functioning of the electricity industry is highly dependent on these control systems. Nevertheless, for many years, aspects of the electricity network lacked (1) technologies— such as sensors—to allow system operators to monitor how much electricity was flowing on distribution lines, (2) communications networks to further integrate parts of the electricity grid with control centers, and (3) computerized control devices to automate system management and recovery. As the electricity industry has matured and technology has advanced, utilities have begun taking steps to update the electricity grid—the transmission and distribution systems—by integrating new technologies and additional IT systems and networks. Though utilities have regularly taken such steps in the past, industry and government stakeholders have begun to articulate a broader, more integrated vision for transforming the electricity grid into one that is more reliable and efficient; facilitates alternative forms of generation, including renewable energy; and gives consumers real-time information about fluctuating energy costs. This vision—the smart grid—would increase the use of IT systems and networks and two-way communication to automate actions that system operators formerly had to make manually. Electricity grid modernization is an ongoing process, and initiatives have commonly involved installing advanced metering infrastructure (smart meters) on homes and commercial buildings that enable two-way communication between the utility and customer. Other initiatives include adding “smart” components to provide the system operator with more detailed data on the conditions of the transmission and distribution systems and better tools to observe the overall condition of the grid (referred to as “wide-area situational awareness”). These include advanced, smart switches on the distribution system to reroute electricity around a troubled line and high-resolution, time-synchronized monitors—called phasor measurement units—on the transmission system. The use of smart grid systems may have a number of benefits, including improved reliability with fewer and shorter outages, downward pressure on electricity rates resulting from the ability to shift peak demand, an improved ability to more efficiently use alternative sources of energy, and an improved ability to detect and respond to potential attacks on the grid. Both the federal government and state governments have authority for overseeing the electricity industry. For example, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) regulates rates for wholesale electricity sales and transmission of electricity in interstate commerce. This includes approving whether to allow utilities to recover the costs of investments they make to the transmission system, such as some smart grid investments. Meanwhile, local distribution and retail sales of electricity are generally subject to regulation by state public utility commissions. State and federal authorities also play key roles in overseeing the reliability of the electric grid. State regulators generally have authority to oversee the reliability of the local distribution system. The North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) is the federally designated U.S. Electric Reliability Organization, and is overseen by FERC. NERC has responsibility for conducting reliability assessments and developing and enforcing mandatory standards to ensure the reliability of the bulk power system—i.e., facilities and control systems necessary for operating the transmission network and certain generation facilities needed for reliability. NERC develops reliability standards collaboratively through a deliberative process involving utilities and others in the industry, which are then sent to FERC for approval. These standards include critical infrastructure protection standards for protecting electric utility-critical and cyber-critical assets. FERC has responsibility for reviewing and approving the reliability standards or directing NERC to modify them. In addition, the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 established federal policy to support the modernization of the electricity grid and required actions by a number of federal agencies, including the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), FERC, and the Department of Energy. With regard to cybersecurity, the act required NIST and FERC to take the following actions: NIST was to coordinate development of a framework that includes protocols and model standards for information management to achieve interoperability of smart grid devices and systems. As part of its efforts to accomplish this, NIST identified cybersecurity standards for these systems and the need to develop guidelines for organizations such as electric companies on how to securely implement smart grid systems. In January 2011, we reported that NIST had identified 11 standards involving cybersecurity that support smart grid interoperability and had issued the first version of a cybersecurity guideline. In February 2012, NIST issued the 2.0 version of the framework that, according to NIST documents, added 22 standards, specifications, and guidelines to the 75 standards NIST recommended as being applicable to the smart grid in the 1.0 version from January 2010. In September 2014, NIST issued the first revision of the cybersecurity guidelines. FERC was to adopt standards resulting from NIST’s efforts that it deemed necessary to ensure smart grid functionality and interoperability. However, according to FERC officials, the statute did not provide specific additional authority to allow FERC to require utilities or manufacturers of smart grid technologies to follow these standards. As a result, any standards identified and developed through the NIST-led process are voluntary unless regulators use other authorities to indirectly compel utilities and manufacturers to follow them. Like threats affecting other critical infrastructures, threats to the electricity industry and its transmission and distribution systems are evolving and growing and can come from a wide array of sources. Risks to cyber- based assets can originate from unintentional or intentional threats. Unintentional threats can be caused by, among other things, natural disasters, defective computer or network equipment, software coding errors, and careless or poorly trained employees. Intentional threats include both targeted and untargeted attacks from a variety of sources, including criminal groups, hackers, disgruntled insiders, foreign nations engaged in espionage and information warfare, and terrorists. These adversaries vary in terms of their capabilities, willingness to act, and motives, which can include seeking monetary gain or pursuing a political, economic, or military advantage. For example, adversaries possessing sophisticated levels of expertise and significant resources to pursue their objectives—sometimes referred to as “advanced persistent threats”—pose increasing risks. They make use of various techniques— or exploits—that may adversely affect federal information, computers, software, networks, and operations, such as a denial of service, which prevents or impairs the authorized use of networks, systems, or applications. The potential impact of these threats is amplified by the connections between industrial control systems, supervisory control and data acquisition (or SCADA) systems, information systems, the Internet, and other infrastructures, which create opportunities for attackers to disrupt critical services, including electrical power. The increased reliance on IT systems and networks also exposes the electric grid to potential and known cybersecurity vulnerabilities. These include an increased number of entry points and paths that can be exploited; the introduction of new, unknown vulnerabilities resulting from an increased use of new system and network technologies; wider access to systems and networks due to increased connectivity; an increased amount of customer information being collected and transmitted, which creates a tempting target for potential attackers. We and others have also reported that smart grid and related systems have known cyber vulnerabilities. For example, cybersecurity experts have demonstrated that certain smart meters can be successfully attacked, possibly resulting in disruption to the electricity grid. In addition, we have reported that control systems used in industrial settings such as electricity generation have vulnerabilities that could result in serious damages and disruption if exploited. Further, in 2007, the Department of Homeland Security, in cooperation with the Department of Energy, ran a test that demonstrated that a vulnerability commonly referred to as “Aurora” had the potential to allow unauthorized users to remotely control, misuse, and cause damage to a small commercial electric generator. Moreover, in 2008, the Central Intelligence Agency reported that malicious activities against IT systems and networks have caused disruption of electric power capabilities in multiple regions overseas, including a case that resulted in a multicity power outage. In January 2014, the Director of National Intelligence testified that industrial control systems and SCADA systems used in electrical power distribution and other industries provided an enticing target to malicious actors and that, although newer architectures provide flexibility, functionality, and resilience, large segments remain vulnerable to attack, which might cause significant economic or human impact. Further, in 2015 the Director testified that studies asserted that foreign cyber actors were developing means to access industrial control systems remotely, including those that manage critical infrastructures such as electric power grids. As government, private sector, and personal activities continue to move to networked operations, the threat will continue to grow. Cyber incidents continue to affect the electric industry. For example, the Department of Homeland Security’s Industrial Control Systems Cyber Emergency Response Team noted that the number of reported cyber incidents affecting control systems of companies in the electricity subsector increased from 3 in 2009 to 25 in 2011. The response team reported that the energy sector, which includes the electricity subsector, led all others in fiscal year 2014 with 79 reported incidents. Reported incidents affecting the electricity subsector have had a variety of impacts, including hacks into smart meters to steal power, failure in control systems devices requiring power plants to be shut down, and malicious software disabling safety monitoring systems. As we have previously reported, multiple entities have taken steps to help secure the electricity grid, including NERC, NIST, FERC, and the Departments of Homeland Security and Energy. For example, NERC developed critical infrastructure standards for protecting electric utility– critical and cyber-critical assets. These standards established requirements for key cybersecurity-related controls: the identification of critical cyber assets, security management, personnel and training, electronic “security perimeters,” physical security of critical cyber assets, systems security management, incident reporting and response planning, and recovery plans for critical cyber assets. In December 2011 we reported that NERC’s cybersecurity standards, along with supplementary guidance, were substantially similar to NIST guidance applicable at the time to federal agencies. NERC had also published security guidelines for companies to consider for protecting electric infrastructure systems, although these guidelines were voluntary and typically not checked for compliance. For example, some of this guidance was intended to assist entities in identifying and developing a list of critical cyber assets. As of October 2015, NERC listed about 30 critical infrastructure protection standards for cybersecurity, some of which were subject to enforcement, some which were subject to future enforcement, and some which were pending regulatory filing or approval. NERC also had enforced compliance with mandatory cybersecurity standards through its Compliance Monitoring and Enforcement Program, including assessing monetary penalties for violations. NIST, in accordance with its responsibilities under the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007, has identified cybersecurity standards for smart grid systems. Specifically, in August 2010 NIST had identified 11 such standards and issued the first version of a cybersecurity guideline. As we reported in January 2011, NIST’s guidelines largely addressed key cybersecurity elements, with the exception of the risk of attacks using both cyber and physical means—an element essential to securing smart grid systems. We recommended that NIST finalize its plan and schedule for incorporating the missing elements into its guidelines. In 2014, NIST issued updated guidelines, which address the relationship of smart grid cybersecurity to cyber-physical attacks and cybersecurity testing and certification. In addition, the updated guidelines describe the relationship of smart grid cybersecurity to NIST’s cybersecurity framework that was issued in February 2014. This framework, which was developed in accordance with Executive Order 13636, is to enable organizations—regardless of size, degree of cybersecurity risk, or cybersecurity sophistication—to apply the principles and best practices of risk management to improving the cybersecurity and resilience of critical infrastructure. FERC had also taken several actions, including reviewing and approving NERC’s critical infrastructure protection standards in 2008. It had also directed NERC to make changes to the standards to improve cybersecurity protections. However, in 2012 the FERC Chairman stated that many of the outstanding directives had not been incorporated into the standards. We also noted in our January 2011 report that FERC had begun reviewing smart grid standards identified by NIST, but declined to adopt them due to insufficient consensus. The Department of Homeland Security, in its capacity as the lead federal agency for cyber-critical infrastructure protection, had issued recommended practices to reduce risks to industrial control systems in critical infrastructure sectors, including the electricity subsector. The department has also provided on-site support to respond to and analyze security incidents and shared actionable intelligence, vulnerability information, and threat analysis with companies in the electricity subsector. In addition, the department, in accordance with Executive Order 13636, established a program to promote the adoption of the NIST cybersecurity framework. As the lead agency responsible for critical infrastructure protection efforts in the energy sector, the Department of Energy, as we reported in December 2011, was involved in efforts to assist the electricity subsector in the development, assessment, and sharing of cybersecurity standards, according to department officials. In addition, the department has created sector-specific guidance to assist the sector in implementing the NIST cybersecurity framework. The guidance includes sections that explain framework concepts for its application, identify example resources that may support framework use, provide a general approach to framework implementation, and identify an example of a tool-specific approach to implementing the framework. In our January 2011 report we identified a number of key challenges that industry and government stakeholders faced in securing the systems and networks supporting the electricity grid. Monitoring implementation of cybersecurity standards. Best practices for information security call for monitoring the extent to which security controls have been implemented. In our report, we noted that FERC had not developed an approach coordinated with other regulators to monitor, at a high level, the extent to which industry follows the voluntary smart grid standards it adopts. We recommended that FERC, in coordination with state regulators and groups that represent utilities subject to less FERC and state regulation, periodically evaluate the extent to which utilities and manufacturers are following voluntary interoperability and cybersecurity standards and develop strategies for addressing any gaps in compliance with standards that are identified as a result of this evaluation. However, FERC has not implemented this recommendation. While FERC reported that it has taken steps to collaborate with stakeholders, it has not taken steps to determine the extent to which the voluntary standards have been integrated into products or whether they are effective. Monitoring such efforts would help FERC and other regulators know if their approach to standards setting is effective or if changes are needed. Clarifying regulatory responsibilities. Experts we spoke with during the course of our review in 2011 expressed concern that there was a lack of clarity about the division of responsibility between federal and state regulators, particularly regarding cybersecurity. While jurisdictional responsibility has historically been determined by whether a technology is located on the transmission or distribution system, experts raised concerns that smart grid technology may blur these lines because, for example, devices deployed on parts of the grid traditionally subject to state jurisdiction could, in the aggregate, affect the reliability of the transmission system, which falls under federal jurisdiction. Experts also noted concern about the ability of regulatory bodies to respond quickly to evolving cybersecurity threats. Clarifying these responsibilities could help improve the effectiveness of efforts to protect smart grid technology from cyber threats. Taking a comprehensive approach to cybersecurity. To secure their systems and information, entities should adopt an integrated, organization-wide program for managing information security risk. Such an approach helps ensure that risk management decisions are aligned strategically with the organization’s mission and security controls are effectively implemented. However, as we reported in 2011, experts told us that the existing federal and state regulatory environment had created a culture within the utility industry of focusing on compliance with regulatory requirements instead of one focused on achieving comprehensive and effective cybersecurity. By taking such a comprehensive approach, utilities could better mitigate cybersecurity risk. Ensuring that smart grid systems have built-in security features. Information systems should be securely configured, including having the ability to record events that take place on networks to allow for detecting and analyzing potential attacks. Nonetheless, experts told us that certain currently available smart meters had not been designed with a strong security architecture and lacked important security features, such as event logging. By ensuring that smart grid systems are securely designed, utilities could enhance their ability to detect and analyze attacks, reducing the risk that attacks will succeed and helping to prevent them from recurring. Effectively sharing cybersecurity information. Information sharing is a key element in the model established by federal policy for protecting critical infrastructure. However, the electric industry lacked an effective mechanism to disclose information about cybersecurity vulnerabilities, incidents, threats, lessons learned, and best practices. For example, experts we spoke with stated that while the industry had an information-sharing center, it did not fully address these information needs. Establishing quality processes for information sharing will help provide utilities with the information needed to adequately protect cyber assets against attackers. Establishing metrics for evaluating cybersecurity. Metrics are important for comparing the effectiveness of competing cybersecurity solutions and determining what mix of solutions will make the most secure system. The electric industry, however, was challenged by a lack of cybersecurity metrics, making it difficult to determine the extent to which investments in cybersecurity improve the security of smart grid systems. Developing such metrics could provide utilities with key information for making informed and cost-effective decisions on cybersecurity investments. In our January 2011 report, we recommended that FERC, working with NERC as appropriate, assess whether any cybersecurity challenges identified in our report should be addressed in commission cybersecurity efforts. Since that time, FERC took the following actions. First, in 2011, it began evaluating whether cybersecurity challenges, including those identified in our report, should be addressed under the agency’s existing cyber security authority and efforts. As a part of this effort, the commission directed NERC to revise the electricity industry’s critical infrastructure protection (CIP) standards with the aim of addressing, among other things, cybersecurity challenges identified in our report. In November 2013, NERC issued updated CIP standards to address these and other cybersecurity challenges. Second, the commission held a technical conference in 2011 in which it solicited feedback from industry stakeholders to help inform the agency’s cybersecurity efforts. Third, in September 2012, the commission established an Office of Energy Infrastructure Security, which is to, among other things, help mitigate cybersecurity threats to electricity industry facilities, and to improve cybersecurity information sharing. In summary, as they become increasingly reliant on computerized technologies, the electricity industry’s systems and networks are susceptible to an evolving array of cyber-based threats. Key entities, including NERC and FERC, are critical to approving and disseminating cybersecurity guidance and standards, while NIST, DHS, and the Department of Energy have additional roles to play in providing guidance and providing other forms of support for protecting the sector against cyber threats. Moreover, without monitoring the implementation of voluntary cybersecurity standards in the industry, FERC does not know the extent to which such standards have been adopted or whether they are effective. Given the increasing use of information and communications technology in the electricity subsector and the evolving nature of cyber threats, continued attention can help mitigate the risk these threats pose to the electricity grid. Chairman Weber, Chairwoman Comstock, Ranking Members Grayson and Lipinski, and Members of the Subcommittees, this concludes my prepared statement.

However, these “smart grid” technologies may be vulnerable to cyber-based attacks and other threats that could disrupt the nation's electricity infrastructure. Several federal entities have responsibilities for overseeing and helping to secure the electricity grid. Because of the proliferation of cyber threats, since 2003 GAO has designated protecting the systems supporting U.S. critical infrastructure (which includes the electricity grid) as a high-risk area. GAO was asked to provide a statement on opportunities to improve cybersecurity for the electricity grid. In preparing this statement, GAO relied on previous work on efforts to address cybersecurity of the electric sector. GAO reported in 2011 that several entities—the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC), the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), and the Department of Energy (DOE)—had taken steps to help secure the electric grid. These included developing cybersecurity standards and other guidance to reduce risks. While these were important efforts, GAO at that time also identified a number of challenges to securing the electricity grid against cyber threats: Monitoring implementation of cybersecurity standards : GAO found that FERC had not developed an approach, coordinated with other regulatory entities, to monitor the extent to which the electricity industry was following voluntary smart grid standards, including cybersecurity standards. Clarifying regulatory responsibilities: The nature of smart grid technology can blur traditional lines between the portions of the grid that are subject to federal or state regulation. In addition, regulators may be challenged in responding quickly to evolving cybersecurity threats. Taking a comprehensive approach to cybersecurity: Entities in the electricity industry (e.g., utilities) often focused on complying with regulations rather than taking a holistic and effective approach to cybersecurity. Ensuring that smart grid systems have built-in security features: Smart grid devices (e.g., meters) did not always have key security features such as the ability to record activity on systems or networks, which is important for detecting and analyzing attacks. Effectively sharing cybersecurity information: The electricity industry did not have a forum for effectively sharing information on cybersecurity vulnerabilities, incidents, threats, and best practices. Establishing cybersecurity metrics: The electricity industry lacked sufficient metrics for determining the extent to which investments in cybersecurity improved the security of smart grid systems. Since 2011, additional efforts have been taken to improve cybersecurity in the sector. For example, in 2013, NERC issued updated standards to address these and other cybersecurity challenges. NIST also updated its smart grid cybersecurity standards in 2014. It has also developed a cybersecurity framework for critical infrastructure, and DHS and DOE have efforts under way to promote its adoption. In addition, FERC assessed whether these and other challenges should be addressed in its ongoing cybersecurity efforts. However, FERC did not coordinate with other regulators to identify strategies for monitoring compliance with voluntary cybersecurity standards in the industry, as GAO had recommended. As a result, FERC does not know the extent to which such standards have been adopted or whether they are effective. Given the increasing use of information and communications technology in the electricity subsector and the evolving nature of cyber threats, continued attention can help mitigate the risk these threats pose to the electricity grid. In its 2011 report, GAO recommended that (1) NIST improve its cybersecurity standards, (2) FERC assess whether challenges identified by GAO should be addressed in ongoing cybersecurity efforts, and (3) FERC coordinate with other regulators to identify strategies for monitoring compliance with voluntary standards. The agencies agreed with the recommendations, but FERC has not taken steps to monitor compliance with voluntary standards.",govreport
"As we reported earlier this year, mission-critical skills gaps within the federal workforce pose a high risk to the nation. Regardless of whether the shortfalls are in such government-wide occupations as cybersecurity and acquisitions, or in agency-specific occupations such as nurses at the Veterans Health Administration, skills gaps impede the federal government from cost-effectively serving the public and achieving results. Agencies can have skills gaps for different reasons: they may have an insufficient number of people or their people may not have the appropriate skills or abilities to accomplish mission-critical work. Moreover, current budget and long-term fiscal pressures, the changing nature of federal work, and a potential wave of employee retirements that could produce gaps in leadership and institutional knowledge, threaten to aggravate the problems created by existing skills gaps. According to our analysis of OPM data, government-wide more than 34 percent of federal employees on-board by the end of fiscal year 2015 will be eligible to retire by 2020 (see figure 1). Some agencies, such as the Department of Housing and Urban Development, will have particularly high eligibility levels by 2020. Various factors can affect when individuals actually retire, and some amount of retirement and other forms of attrition can be beneficial because it creates opportunities to bring fresh skills on board and it allows organizations to restructure themselves to better meet program goals and fiscal realities. But if turnover is not strategically monitored and managed, gaps can develop in an organization’s institutional knowledge and leadership. While numerous tools are available to help agencies address their talent needs, our past work has identified problems across a range of personnel systems and functions. For example: Classification system: The GS system has not kept pace with the government’s evolving requirements. Recruiting and hiring: Federal agencies need a hiring process that is applicant friendly, flexible, and meets policy requirements. Pay system: Employees are compensated through an outmoded system that (1) rewards length of service rather than individual performance and contributions, and (2) automatically provides across- the-board annual pay increases, even to poor performers. Performance management: Developing modern, credible, and effective employee performance management systems and dealing with poor performers have been long-standing challenges for federal agencies. Employee engagement: Additional analysis and sharing of promising practices could improve employee engagement and performance. As we reported in 2012, Congress’s policy calls for federal workers’ pay under the GS system to be aligned with comparable nonfederal workers’ pay. Across-the-board pay adjustments are to be based on private sector salary growth. Locality adjustments are designed to reduce the gap between federal and nonfederal pay in each locality to no more than 5 percent. The President’s Pay Agent is the entity charged with determining the disparities between federal and nonfederal pay in each locality; it measures federal pay based on OPM records that identify GS employees by occupation and grade level, and nonfederal pay based on U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics data (BLS). In 2012, the Pay Agent has recommended that the underlying model and methodology for estimating pay gaps be reexamined to ensure that private sector and federal sector pay comparisons are as accurate as possible. As of December 2016, no such reexamination has taken place. The across-the-board and locality pay increases may be made every year, and are not linked to performance. Pay increases and monetary awards that are linked to performance ratings as determined by the agencies’ performance appraisal systems include within-grade increases, ratings-based cash awards, and quality step increases, and are available to GS employees. Within-grade increases are the least strongly linked to performance, ratings-based cash awards are more strongly linked to performance depending on the rating system the agency uses, and quality step increases are also more strongly linked to performance. The composition of the federal workforce has changed over the past 30 years, with the need for clerical and blue collar roles diminishing and professional, administrative, and technical roles increasing. As a result, today’s federal jobs require more advanced skills at higher grade levels than in years past. Additionally, we have found that federal jobs, on average, require more advanced skills and degrees than private sector jobs. This is because a higher proportion of federal jobs than nonfederal are in skilled occupations such as science, engineering, and program management, while a lower proportion of federal jobs than nonfederal are in occupations such as manufacturing, construction, and service work. The result is that the federal workforce is on average more highly educated than the private sector workforce. As we reported in 2014, a key federal human capital management challenge is how best to balance the size and composition of the federal workforce so that it is able to deliver the high quality services that taxpayers demand, within the budgetary realities of what the nation can afford. Recognizing that the federal government’s pay system does not align well with modern compensation principles (where pay decisions are based on the skills, knowledge, and performance of employees as well as the local labor market), Congress has provided various agencies with exemptions from the current system to give them more flexibility in setting pay. Thus, a long-standing federal human capital management question is how to update the entire federal compensation system to be more market based and performance oriented. This type of system is a critical component of a larger effort to improve organizational performance. Our 2005 work showed that implementing a more market-based and more performance-oriented pay system is both doable and desirable. However, we also found that it is not easy. For one thing, agencies should have effective performance management systems that link individual expectations to organizational results. Moreover, representatives of public, private, and nonprofit organizations, in discussing the successes and challenges they have experienced in designing and implementing their own results-oriented pay systems, told us at the time they had to shift from a culture where compensation is based on position and longevity to one that is performance-oriented, affordable and sustainable. As we have reported in the past, these organizations’ experiences with their own market-based and performance-oriented pay systems provide useful lessons learned that will be important to consider to the extent the federal government moves toward a more results-oriented pay system. Lessons learned identified in our 2005 report include the following: 1. Focus on a set of values and objectives to guide the pay system. Values represent an organization’s beliefs and boundaries, and objectives articulate the strategy to implement the system. 2. Examine the value of employees’ total compensation to remain competitive in the labor market. Organizations consider a mix of base pay plus other monetary incentives, benefits and deferred compensation, such as retirement pay, as part of a competitive compensation system. 3. Build in safeguards to enhance the transparency and ensure the fairness of pay decisions. Safeguards are the precondition to linking pay systems with employee knowledge, skills, and contributions to results. 4. Devolve decision-making on pay to appropriate levels. When devolving such decision making, overall core processes help ensure reasonable consistency in how the system is implemented. 5. Provide training on leadership, management, and interpersonal skills to facilitate effective communication. Such skills as setting expectations, linking individual performance to organizational results, and giving and receiving feedback need renewed emphasis to make such systems succeed. 6. Build consensus to gain ownership and acceptance for pay reforms. Employee and stakeholder involvement needs to be meaningful and not pro forma. 7. Monitor and refine the implementation of the pay system. While changes are usually inevitable, listening to employee views and using metrics helps identify and correct problems over time. Our prior work has found that across a range of human capital functions, while in some cases statutory changes may be needed to advance reforms, in many instances improvements are within the control of federal agencies. These improvements include such actions as improving the coordination of hiring specialists and hiring managers on developing recruitment strategies and up-to-date position descriptions in vacancy announcements. Indeed, Congress has already provided agencies with a number of tools and flexibilities to help them build and maintain a high- performing workforce. Going forward, it will be important for agencies to make effective use of those tools and for Congress to hold agencies accountable for doing so. Among other things, our work has shown that the tone starts at the top. Agency leaders and managers should set an example that human capital is important and is directly linked to performance—it is not a transactional function. As we noted in our 2017 high-risk update, agencies can drive improvements to their high risk areas—including strategic human capital management—through such steps as: Sustained leadership commitment, including developing long-term priorities and goals, and providing continuing oversight and accountability; Ensuring agencies have adequate capacity to address their personnel issues, including collaborating with other agencies and stakeholders as appropriate; Identifying root causes of problems and developing action plans to address them, including establishing goals and performance measures; Monitoring actions by, for example, tracking performance measures and progress against goals; and Demonstrating progress by showing issues are being effectively managed and root causes are being addressed. Our list of leading human capital management practices may be helpful as well. Covering such activities as strategic workforce planning, recruitment and hiring, workforce development, and employee engagement, among others, agencies can use this information to strengthen how they recruit, retain, and develop their employees and Congress can hold agencies accountable for using them. OPM has taken some important steps as well. For example, in December 2016, OPM finalized revisions to its strategic human capital management regulation that include the new Human Capital Framework. This framework is to be used in 2017 by agencies to plan, implement, evaluate, and improve human capital policies and programs. Our recent work on federal hiring, classification, addressing poor performance, and the capacity of federal human resource functions are illustrative of some of the areas in need of attention. To help ensure agencies have the talent they need to meet their missions, we have found that federal agencies should have a hiring process that is simultaneously applicant friendly, sufficiently flexible to enable agencies to meet their needs, and consistent with statutory requirements, such as hiring on the basis of merit. Key to achieving this is the hiring authority used to bring applicants onboard. Congress and the President have created a number of hiring authorities to expedite the hiring process or to achieve certain public policy goals, such as facilitating the entrance of certain groups into the civil service. As we reported in 2016, we found that of the 105 hiring authorities used in fiscal year 2014, agencies relied on 20 of those authorities for 91 percent of the 196,226 new appointments made that year. OPM officials said at the time they did not know if agencies relied on a small number of authorities because agencies are unfamiliar with other authorities, or if they have found other authorities to be less effective. Although OPM tracks such data as agency time-to-hire, we found this information was not used by OPM or agencies to analyze the effectiveness of hiring authorities. As a result, OPM and agencies did not know if authorities were meeting their intended purposes. By analyzing hiring authorities, OPM and agencies could identify opportunities to refine authorities, expand access to specific authorities found to be highly efficient and effective, and eliminate those found to be less effective. We recommended that OPM, working with agencies, strengthen hiring efforts by (1) analyzing the extent to which federal hiring authorities are meeting agencies’ needs, and (2) using this information to explore opportunities to refine, eliminate, or expand authorities as needed, among other recommendations. OPM concurred with our recommendations, and reported it had reviewed hiring authorities related to the entry-level Pathways Program and for hiring seasonal employees. The GS classification system is a mechanism for organizing federal white- collar work—notably for the purpose of determining pay—based on a position’s duties, responsibilities, and difficulty, among other things. A guiding principle of the GS classification system is that employees should earn equal pay for substantially equal work. We and others have found that the work of the federal government has become more highly skilled and specialized than the GS classification system was designed to address when it was created in 1949 when most of the federal workforce was engaged in clerical work. While there is no one right way to design a classification system, in 2014, we identified eight key attributes that are important for a modern, effective classification system. Collectively, these attributes provide a useful framework for considering refinements or reforms to the current system. These key attributes are described in table 1. We concluded in 2014 that the inherent tension between some of these attributes, and the values policymakers and stakeholders emphasize could have large implications for pay, the ability to recruit and retain mission critical employees, and other aspects of personnel management. This is one reason why—despite past proposals—changes to the current system have been few, as finding the optimal mix of attributes that is acceptable to all stakeholders is difficult. In 2014, we recommended that OPM (1) work with stakeholders to examine ways to modernize the classification system, (2) develop a strategy to track and prioritize occupations for review and updates, and (3) develop cost-effective methods to ensure agencies are classifying correctly. OPM partially concurred with the first and third recommendation but did not concur with the second recommendation. Instead, OPM officials said they already tracked and prioritized occupations for updates. However, they were unable to provide documentation of their actions. In April 2017, OPM officials said they meet regularly with the interagency classification policy forum to inform classification implementation and had reviewed and canceled 21 occupational series that were minimally used by agencies. In our 2015 report, we noted how federal agencies’ ability to address poor performance has been a long-standing issue. Employees and agency leaders share a perception that more needs to be done to address poor performance, as even a small number of poor performers can affect agencies’ capacity to meet their missions. More generally, without effective performance management, agencies risk losing (or failing to utilize) the skills of top talent. They also may miss the opportunity to observe and correct poor performance. Among other things, we found effective performance management helps agencies establish a clear “line of sight” between individual performance and organizational success and using core competencies helps to reinforce organizational objectives. Agencies should also make meaningful distinctions in employee performance levels. However, we found that 99 percent of permanent, non-senior executive service employees in 2013 received a rating at or above fully successful, with around 61 percent rated as “outstanding” or “exceeds fully successful.” Importantly, in 2015 we found that good supervisors are key to the success of any performance management system. Supervisors provide the day-to-day performance management activities that can help sustain and improve the performance of more talented staff and can help marginal performers to become better. As a result, agencies should promote people into supervisory positions because of their supervisory skills (in addition to their technical skills) and ensure that new supervisors receive sufficient training in performance management. Likewise, a cultural shift might be needed among agencies and employees to acknowledge that a rating of “fully successful” is already a high bar and should be valued and rewarded and that “outstanding” is a difficult level to achieve. Further, in 2015 we found that probationary periods for new employees provide supervisors with an opportunity to evaluate an individual’s performance to determine if an appointment to the civil service should become final. However, some Chief Human Capital Officers (CHCO) said supervisors often do not use this time to make performance-related decisions about an employee’s performance because they may not know that the probationary period is ending or they have not had time to observe performance in all critical areas. In our prior work, we recommended that OPM educate agencies on ways to notify supervisors that an individual’s probationary period is ending and that the supervisor needs to make a decision about the individual’s performance and also to determine whether there are occupations in which the probationary period should extend beyond 1-year to provide supervisors with sufficient time to assess an individual’s performance. OPM concurred with the first recommendation and partially concurred with the second. In January 2017, OPM issued guidance to agency about supervisors notification of a probationary period ending, but officials said OPM had not taken action on extending the probationary period. In 2014, we found that many agency CHCO said their offices did not have the capacity to lead strategic human capital management activities such as talent management, workforce planning, and promoting high performance and a results-oriented culture. Instead, these offices remained focused on transactional human resource activities like benefits and processing personnel actions. As a result, officials said agency decision makers often did not seek out and draw upon the expertise of human capital experts to inform their deliberations. Perhaps further reflecting the varying capabilities of agency human capital offices across government, some CHCOs at the time said that agency leaders did not fully understand the potential for strategic human capital management and had not elevated the role of the human capital office to better support an agency’s operations and mission. The human resources specialist occupation continues to be one of six government-wide, mission-critical skills gap areas identified by OPM. Our recent work on the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) demonstrates how capacity shortfalls in an agency’s personnel office can adversely impact an organization’s mission. Among other things, we found that the recruitment and retention challenges VHA is experiencing with its clinical workforce are due, in part to attrition among its human resource employees and unmet staffing targets within medical center personnel offices. We concluded that until VHA strengthens its human resource capacity, it will not be positioned to effectively support its mission to serve veterans’ healthcare needs. We made 12 recommendations to Veterans Affairs (VA) to improve the human resource capacity and oversight of human resource functions at its medical centers; develop a modern, credible employee performance management system; and establish clear accountability for efforts to improve employee engagement. VA concurred with nine recommendations and partially concurred with three recommendations to improve VHA’s performance management system. Under OPM’s leadership, several steps have been taken as part of a cross agency group focused on improving the capacity of human resource specialists. For example, OPM reported that it increased registration in its Human Resources University and validated career path guides for classification, recruitment and hiring policy, and employee relations. As part of our ongoing oversight of OPM’s and agencies’ efforts to close government-wide mission critical skill gaps, we will continue to assess the progress being made in improving the human capital infrastructure within agencies needed to better support agencies’ planning and programmatic functions. In conclusion, given the long-term fiscal challenges facing the nation and ongoing operational and accountability issues across government, agencies must identify options to meet their missions with fewer resources. The federal compensation system should allow the government to cost-effectively attract, motivate, and retain a high- performing, agile workforce necessary to meet those missions. At the same time, our work has shown that agencies already have a number of tools and flexibilities available to them that can significantly improve executive branch personnel management and do so sooner, rather than later. Going forward, it will be important to hold agencies accountable for fully leveraging those resources. Chairman Chaffetz, Ranking Member Cummings, and Members of the Committee, this completes my prepared statement. I would be pleased to respond to any questions you may have at this time.

High-performing organizations have found that the life-cycle of human capital management activities—including workforce planning, recruitment, on-boarding, compensation, engagement, succession planning, and retirement programs—need to be aligned for the cost-effective achievement of an organization's mission. However, despite some improvements, strategic human capital management—and more specifically, skills gaps in mission critical occupations—continues to be a GAO high-risk area. This testimony is based on a body of GAO work primarily issued between June 2012 and March 2017. It focuses on (1) lessons learned in creating a more market driven, results-oriented approach to federal pay, and (2) opportunities, in addition to pay and benefits, that OPM and agencies could use to be more competitive in the labor market and address skills gaps. GAO's prior work has shown that implementing a market-based and more performance-oriented federal pay system is both doable and desirable, and should be part of a broader strategy of change management and performance improvement initiatives. In 2005, GAO identified the following key themes that highlight the leadership and management strategies high-performing organizations collectively considered in designing and managing a pay system that is performance oriented, affordable, and sustainable. Specifically, they: 1. Focus on a set of values and objectives to guide the pay system. 2. Examine the value of employees' total compensation to remain competitive in the labor market. 3. Build in safeguards to enhance the transparency and ensure the fairness of pay decisions. 4. Devolve decision-making on pay to appropriate levels. 5. Provide clear and consistent communication so that employees at all levels can understand how compensation reforms are implemented. 6. Build consensus to gain ownership and acceptance for pay reforms. 7. Monitor and refine the implementation of the pay system. While the federal compensation system may need to be re-examined, Congress has already provided agencies with tools and flexibilities to build and maintain a high-performing workforce. They include, for example: Hiring process GAO reported in 2016 that the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) and selected agencies had not evaluated the effectiveness of hiring authorities. By evaluating them, of which over 100 were used in 2014, OPM and agencies could identify ways to expand access to those found to be more effective, and eliminate those found to be less effective. General Schedule (GS) classification system The federal government has become more highly skilled and specialized than the GS classification system was designed to address at its inception in 1949. OPM and stakeholders should examine ways to make the classification system consistent with attributes GAO identified of a modern, effective classification system, such as internal and external equity. Performance management Credible and effective performance management systems are a strategic tool to achieve organizational results. These systems should emphasize “a line a sight” between individual performance and organizational success, and use core competencies to reinforce organizational objectives, among other things. Human resources capacity The human resources specialist occupation is a mission critical skills gap area. Chief Human Capital Officers have reported that human resources specialists do not have the skills to lead strategic human capital management activities. Strengthening this capacity could help agencies better meet their missions. Over the years, GAO has made recommendations to agencies and OPM to improve their strategic human capital management efforts. OPM and agencies generally concurred. This testimony discusses actions taken to implement key recommendations to improve federal hiring and classification.",govreport
"Under the Federal Meat Inspection Act, the Poultry Products Inspection Act, and the Egg Products Inspection Act, USDA, through FSIS, is responsible for ensuring the safety of meat, poultry, and certain egg products. Under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and the Public Health Service Act, FDA is responsible for all other foods, including fruits and vegetables; dairy products; seafood; and certain canned, frozen, and packaged foods. The food-processing sector is generally described as the middle segment of the farm-to-table continuum—it extends from the time livestock and crops leave the farm for slaughter and processing into food until it reaches retail establishments. FDA and FSIS work to ensure the safety of food products processed in the United States through a regulatory system of preventive controls that identifies hazards early in the production process to minimize the risk of contamination. Known as the Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point (HACCP) system, it makes food-processing facilities responsible for developing a plan that identifies harmful microbiological, chemical, and physical hazards that are reasonably likely to occur and establishes critical control points to prevent or reduce contamination. Through their inspection programs, FDA and FSIS verify that food processors are implementing their HACCP plans. FDA inspects over 57,000 food facilities every 5 years on average, and USDA inspects over 6,000 meat and poultry slaughter and processing facilities daily. Individual states also conduct yearly inspections of about 300,000 food-processing facilities, including small firms with fewer than 10 employees and large corporations with thousands of employees and multiple processing plants located in many states. Both FDA and FSIS have the authority to take enforcement actions as necessary to ensure that facilities meet the agencies’ safety and sanitation regulatory requirements. As we reported in 2001, in fiscal year 1999, the latest year for which such information was available, FDA, FSIS, and the states spent a total of about $1.3 billion on food safety activities. Following the events of September 11, 2001, the federal government intensified its efforts to address the potential for deliberate contamination of agriculture and food products. On October 8, 2001, the President issued an executive order establishing the Office of Homeland Security, which added the agriculture and food industries to the list of critical infrastructure systems needing protection from terrorist attack. In addition, the Congress provided FDA and USDA with emergency funding to prevent, prepare for, and respond to potential bioterrorist attacks through the Department of Defense Appropriation Act of 2002: $97 million for FDA and $15 million for FSIS. For the most part, FDA has used the emergency funds to enhance the security of imported food by hiring new inspectors and increasing inspections at U.S. ports of entry. FSIS has used its emergency funds to support its food security activities, which include, among other things, providing educational and specialized training. FDA’s fiscal year 2003 budget builds upon funding received from the fiscal year 2002 appropriation plus the fiscal year 2002 emergency supplemental funding of $97 million to counter terrorism. FDA plans to seek additional funding in the future for food safety activities and security activities related to terrorism. FSIS is asking for an additional $28 million. The Congress also enacted the Public Health Security and Bioterrorism Preparedness and Response Act of 2002, which contains numerous provisions designed to enhance the safety and security of the food, drug, and water industries. In addition, both FDA and USDA have taken many actions to better protect the food supply against deliberate contamination. For example, FDA has hired 655 new food safety investigators and laboratory personnel in the field. In addition, it has participated in several exercises at the federal and state levels to enhance emergency response procedures. Furthermore, FDA is working with CDC to initiate and implement a nationwide Laboratory Response Network for foods to identify laboratory capacity for testing agents that could be used to deliberately contaminate food. It has also provided additional laboratory training for food safety personnel and sought stakeholders’ input to develop regulations that are required by the new bioterrorism legislation. Moreover, FDA worked with the Office of the Surgeon General, U.S. Air Force, to adapt a version of the Operational Risk Management approach to examine the relative risks of intentional contamination during various stages of food production and distribution. Within the Department of Health and Human Services, both FDA and CDC have worked closely with federal, state, and local agencies to enhance their surveillance of diseases caused by foodborne pathogens. FDA’s efforts to reduce food security risks also include working with other federal agencies, trade associations, and the Alliance for Food Security. USDA has formed a Homeland Security Council to develop a Department- wide plan to coordinate efforts between all USDA agencies and offices. The Department has also established the FSIS Office of Food Security and Emergency Preparedness to centralize the Department’s work on security matters. USDA has also coordinated with other government agencies, such as the Office of Homeland Security, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), and FDA, to develop prevention, detection, and response procedures to better protect the nation’s food supply. USDA will be increasing the number of import inspectors by 20. These inspectors will place special emphasis on food security in addition to their traditional food safety role. In addition, USDA has participated in several exercises at the federal and state levels to enhance response procedures and has conducted risk assessments for domestic and imported food. Since this review began, USDA has conducted three simulation exercises at the Department and agency level to test the Department’s response to a terrorist attack and is planning three additional simulations for the spring of 2003. USDA has also conducted preparedness-training sessions for veterinarians and circuit supervisors. (Circuit supervisors supervise the work of in-plant inspection personnel and discuss the security guidelines with them.) Experts from government and academia generally agree that terrorists could use food products as a vehicle for introducing harmful agents into the food supply. Just recently, the National Academies reported that terrorists could use toxic chemicals or infectious agents to contaminate food production facilities and that, although much attention has been paid to ensuring safety and purity throughout the various stages of processing and distribution, protecting the food supply from intentional contamination has not been a major focus of federal agencies. Among other things, the report says that FDA should act promptly to extend its HACCP methodology so that it could be used to deal effectively with the deliberate contamination of the food supply. In February 2002, CDC reported that although the food and water systems in the United States are among the safest in the world, the nationwide outbreaks due to unintentional food or water contamination demonstrate the ongoing need for vigilance in protecting food and water supplies. All of the bioterrorism experts whom we consulted from academia agreed that the food supply is at risk. The food safety statutes do not specifically authorize FDA or USDA to require food processors to implement any type of security measures designed to prevent the intentional contamination of the foods they produce. While these agencies’ food safety statutes can be interpreted to provide authority to impose certain security requirements, as opposed to food safety requirements, neither agency believes it has the authority to regulate all aspects of security. Counsel in the Department of Health and Human Service’s Office of the Assistant Secretary for Legislation advised that FDA’s authorities under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and the Public Health Service Act provide FDA with tools to adopt measures to control insanitary preparation, packing, and holding conditions that could lead to unsafe food; detect contamination of food; and control contaminated food. However, Counsel also advised that FDA’s food safety authorities do not extend to the regulation of physical facility security measures. FDA’s counsel provided a similar assessment, telling us that, to the extent that food safety and security overlap, FDA might be able to require the industry to take precautionary steps to improve security but observed that there is little overlap between safety and security. One area where safety and security do overlap is in the handling of hazardous materials. FDA’s existing safety regulations specify that hazardous chemicals should be stored so that they cannot contaminate food products. This requirement overlaps with FDA’s food security guidelines advising that hazardous chemicals be stored in a secure area and that access to them be limited. USDA, on the other hand, has a somewhat more expansive view of the extent to which its statutory authority allows it to require food processors to adopt certain security measures. USDA’s general counsel concluded that to the extent that security precautions pertain to activities closely related to sanitary conditions in the food preparation process, FSIS has the authority to require food processors to implement certain security measures. The general counsel concluded that FSIS could require facilities to develop and maintain a food security management plan concerning their response to an actual threat involving product tampering, since this is directly related to food adulteration. Such a plan could be added to a current HACCP plan or it could be entirely separate. USDA also believes that FSIS has authority to mandate its “inside security” guidelines, such as controlling or restricting access to certain areas, monitoring the operation of equipment to prevent tampering, and keeping accurate inventories of restricted ingredients and hazardous chemicals. Similarly, USDA believes that many of its security measures that address shipping and receiving food products or protecting water and ice used in processing products also could be made mandatory. These measures include putting tamper-proof seals on incoming and outgoing shipments and controlling access to water lines and ice storage. On the other hand, USDA believes that the “outside security” measures included in its guidelines, such as securing plant boundaries and providing guards, alarms, and outside lighting, have little to do with sanitation in the facility or the immediate food-processing environment and, therefore, could not be made mandatory under existing authorities. With respect to the guidelines’ personnel security measures, USDA noted that FSIS has limited authority over personnel matters at food-processing facilities and could not require facilities to perform personnel background checks before hiring. In response to the nation’s growing concerns regarding the potential for deliberate contamination of the food supply, FDA and USDA issued guidelines to the food-processing industry suggesting measures to enhance security at their facilities. Among other things, the guidelines suggests conducting a risk assessment, developing a plan to address security risks at plants, and adopting a wide range of security measures inside and outside the premises. Food-processing facilities are not required to adopt any of the security measures but are encouraged to adopt those that they feel are best suited for their operations. Although both agencies have alerted their field inspection personnel to be vigilant about security issues, they have also told the inspectors that they are not authorized to enforce these measures and have instructed them not to document their observations regarding security because of the possible release of this information under the Freedom of Information Act and the potential for the misuse of this information. As a result, FDA and USDA currently do not know the extent to which food security measures are being implemented at food-processing facilities. In contrast, the Congress directed medium-size and large-size community water systems, which are privately or publicly owned, to assess their vulnerability to terrorist attacks and to develop an emergency response plan to prepare for such an event. The act also authorized funding to be used for basic security enhancements, such as the installation of fencing, gating, lighting, or security cameras. This approach enables the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to monitor the water industry’s security efforts and could be a possible model for the food safety agencies. In 2002, FDA and FSIS each issued voluntary security guidelines to the food-processing industry to help federal- and state-inspected plants identify ways to enhance their security. The agencies encouraged food processors, among others, to review their current operations and adopt those security measures suggested in the guidelines that they believed would be best suited for their facilities. Officials from both FDA and FSIS told us that there was little or no coordination between the two agencies in developing these guidelines. The FDA guidance contains over 100 recommended security measures covering seven areas of plant operation, such as managing food security, physical (outside) security, and computer security. FSIS’s guidelines contain 68 security measures and cover seven areas of plant operation. Figure 1 summarizes key aspects of both agencies’ voluntary security guidelines for industry. FDA and FSIS have made the guidelines available on the Internet. These guidelines are very similar—one difference is that FSIS’s contain security measures for slaughter facilities. Some state governments have also acted to protect food products from deliberate contamination. We learned from 11 state auditing offices that food safety regulatory officials from most of these states are providing industry or state inspectors with guidelines, either in the form of the FDA and FSIS guidelines or guidelines developed by the state officials themselves. In addition, three states have enacted new legislation or regulations addressing the security of food products. Although FDA and FSIS do not assess the extent to which food processors are implementing security measures, the agencies have asked their field inspection personnel to be on heightened alert and to discuss, but not interpret, the security guidance with facility officials during their routine food safety inspections. However, both FDA and USDA have instructed their field inspection personnel to refrain from enforcing any aspects of the security guidelines because the agencies generally believe that they lack such authority. They have also instructed their field personnel not to document plants’ security measures because they are concerned that such information would be subject to Freedom of Information Act requests. More specifically, FDA’s instructions to its field personnel specify that they should neither perform a comprehensive food security audit of the establishment nor conduct extensive interviews to determine the extent to which preventive measures suggested in the guidelines have been adopted. The goals, according to FDA, are to heighten industry’s awareness of food security practices, facilitate an exchange of information between FDA and industry on the subject of food security, and encourage plant management to voluntarily implement those preventive measures that they believe are most appropriate for their operation. In short, FDA inspectors are encouraged to discuss food security concerns with plant management and to provide them with copies of the guidelines. Although the exact details of such discussions are not to be recorded, inspectors are required to document in their inspection reports that such discussions took place and that they gave a copy of the guidelines to facility management. Similarly, FSIS has informed its field inspectors that they have no regulatory duties regarding the enforcement of the guidelines. Initially, the agency instructed its inspectors to refer any questions from facility managers to USDA’s Technical Service Center in Omaha, Nebraska. Recently the agency modified its position regarding direct discussions of food security and now allows inspectors to discuss, but not interpret, security with facility management. Inspectors are still instructed not to document these conversations or enforce the adoption of any security measure. Officials from both agencies expressed concerns about gathering security information from facilities because it could be subject to public disclosure through Freedom of Information Act requests. If terrorists gained access to this information, it could give them a road map to target the most vulnerable areas in a food-processing plant. Recent congressional efforts to better protect the nation’s drinking water from terrorist acts may offer a model for FDA and USDA to help monitor security measures adopted at food-processing facilities as well as to identify any security gaps that may exist at these facilities. Although there are differences in how the government regulates drinking water and food, food and water are essential daily consumption elements, and both are regulated to ensure their safety. In June 2002, the Congress enacted the Public Health Security and Bioterrorism Preparedness and Response Act of 2002, which, among other things, amended the Safe Drinking Water Act. The Bioterrorism Act requires medium-size and large-size community water systems (those serving over 3,300 people), which are privately and publicly owned, to certify to EPA that they have assessed their vulnerability to a terrorist attack and developed emergency plans to prepare for and respond to such an attack. These water systems serve 91 percent of the United States’ population. Each community’s water system is required to conduct a vulnerability assessment and submit a copy of the assessment to EPA. The act specifies that the vulnerability assessment is exempt from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act, except for the identity of the community water system and the date on which it certifies compliance. Community water systems are also required to prepare an emergency response plan that incorporates the results of their vulnerability assessments. In addition, the act authorizes funding for financial assistance to community water systems to support the purchasing of security equipment, such as fencing, gating, lighting, or security cameras. FDA and FSIS lack comprehensive information on the extent to which food-processing companies are adopting security measures. However, officials from the majority of the food trade associations that we contacted believe that their members are implementing a range of measures to enhance security at their facilities. We found that the five food-processing facilities we visited in various geographic regions around the country are also implementing an array of security measures that range from developing risk assessment plans to hiring security contractors. Furthermore, our survey of FDA and FSIS inspectors indicates that, generally, food-processing facilities are implementing a range of security measures. The survey responses indicate, however, that the inspectors were more aware of those security measures that were the most visible to them during the course of their regular food safety inspections. According to trade association officials, food processors are voluntarily taking steps to prevent the deliberate contamination of their products, including adopting many of the measures suggested by FDA and FSIS, such as installing fences, requiring that employees wear identification, and restricting access to certain plant areas. Association officials told us that most large food-processing facilities already have ample security plans that include many of the recommendations made by FDA and FSIS. One trade association recently conducted a survey of its members and asked for their opinions about FSIS’s Guidelines. Most of the respondents indicated that they were aware of the guidelines; they believed the guidelines were for the most part practical and workable; and they used them in their security plans. However, these officials were unable to provide data on the extent to which the food-processing industry is implementing security measures to prevent or mitigate the potential deliberate contamination of food products. Trade association officials also said that they provided FDA and FSIS with comments on the voluntary guidelines and, in some cases, have also issued their own food security guidelines to their members. Although the officials generally believe that the agencies’ guidelines are reasonable, they do not want the government to regulate food security. They also feel that some companies, especially small facilities with limited resources, are unable to implement all the measures in the guidelines. Therefore, these officials believe it is important for the guidelines to remain voluntary. The industry is involved in improving food security in other ways as well. For example, the food industry associations formed the Alliance for Food Security to facilitate the exchange of information about food security issues. The Alliance is composed of trade associations representing the food chain, from commodity production through processing, packaging, distribution, and retail sale, as well as government agencies responsible for food and water safety, public health, and law enforcement. Similarly, led by the Food Marketing Institute, the food industry and FBI established the Information Sharing and Analysis Center (ISAC), which serves as a contact point for gathering, analyzing, and disseminating information among companies and the multiagency National Infrastructure Protection Center based at FBI headquarters. Through ISAC, FBI officials have notified food manufacturers of warnings and threats that the Center deems to be credible. ISAC also provides a voluntary mechanism for reporting suspicious activity in a confidential manner and for developing solutions. We visited five food-processing facilities, including a slaughter plant and facilities that produce beverages and ready-to-eat products. Although these facilities are not in any way representative of all food-processing plants nationwide, they provide some information about the types of security measures that some facilities are implementing. All five facilities had conducted risk analyses and, on the basis of the results, had implemented a number of security measures similar to those suggested in the FDA and FSIS guidelines. For example, all five facilities limited access to the facility through such means as requiring visitors to enter through a guard shack and to provide identification. In addition, employees at three of the facilities could enter the facility only by using magnetic cards. However, managers at the five facilities offered differing opinions about personnel security. Although all of the facilities we visited performed background checks on their employees that included verification of social security numbers, only some verified prior work experience, criminal history, and level of education. One company also required that its contractors, such as construction companies working in the facility, perform employment, education, and criminal checks of their own employees. The facilities also used different protocols for employee access to different areas within the plant. For example, at four of the facilities, employees were limited to those areas of the plant in which they worked. While the managers at these facilities generally complimented FDA’s and USDA’s security guidelines, they said that they do not want the agencies to regulate security. Rather, they believe that the agencies should develop a nonprescriptive framework or strategy for industry and then leave them to decide how to meet their individual requirements. One manager believes that food security responsibilities should be moved to the Department of Homeland Security. Finally, our discussions with trade association officials and food- processing industry officials revealed that the industry is very concerned about sharing security information with federal agencies because of the possibility that it could provide a road map for terrorist groups if it were released under the Freedom of Information Act. Although the act exempts from public release certain national security, trade secret, and commercial or financial information, industry officials are generally skeptical about the government’s ability to prevent the release of sensitive security information at food-processing facilities. FBI officials told us that they have cited these exemptions when assuring ISAC members that security information shared with them will be protected from public release. These officials explained that the courts have generally ruled that the commercial information exemption protects those who voluntarily provide the government with information if the information is of a kind that the provider would not ordinarily release to the public. However, the FBI officials we interviewed believe that the government should find some way of assuring industry that sensitive security information is protected from public release. FDA and FSIS survey respondents observed a range of security measures being implemented at food-processing facilities, although both FDA and FSIS respondents were able to provide more information about those security measures that were most visible during the course of their normal inspection duties. Figure 2 shows selected categories of security measures recommended in the FDA and FSIS security guidelines that were most visible to inspectors. The majority of the FDA survey respondents said they were able to observe security measures, such as fencing around the plants’ perimeter, limiting access to restricted areas, securing hazardous materials, and providing adequate interior and exterior lighting. Likewise, most of FSIS’s circuit supervisors were able to observe outside security measures including alarmed emergency exits, plant perimeter protection, positive employee identification, and the inspection of incoming and outgoing vehicles. Survey respondents provided fewer observations regarding other types of security measures included in the FDA and FSIS guidelines—in some instances because these measures were less visible to them. For example, FDA respondents were less able to comment on whether they noticed or knew of the presence of security measures designed to account for missing stock or for other finished product irregularities. (See fig. 3.) Similarly, FSIS respondents were less unable to comment on the extent to which facilities were performing background checks on new employees or implementing proper mail-handling practices. More than half of FSIS’s survey respondents stated that large plants— those with at least 500 employees—had implemented a range of security measures, including the areas of outside security, storage, slaughter and processing, and personnel security. Fewer of these respondents observed these security measures at smaller plants. Some FDA and FSIS respondents provided additional comments that the very small firms typically lack the financial resources to implement many of the security measures suggested in the government guidelines. Similarly, some respondents commented that many of the security measures might not be necessary at smaller establishments. Additionally, most of the FDA respondents reported that they had not received training on food security; while nearly all of the FSIS respondents reported that they had recently received such training. Some of the FSIS respondents further stated that although they had received food security training, further training was greatly needed in the field. Such training would be beneficial because field personnel are encouraged to discuss security measures with managers at the facilities they inspect. Finally, responses to our survey showed that FDA and FSIS respondents have different levels of “satisfaction” with or “confidence” in the efforts of the processing facilities they inspect to ensure the protection of food from acts of deliberate contamination. While nearly half of the FSIS respondents said they were somewhat or very confident of the efforts made by the food processors they inspect, slightly over one-fourth of the FDA respondents were satisfied or very satisfied with the efforts made by the food processors they inspect. Thirty-seven food regulatory officials interviewed by state auditors in 11 states provided opinions on their overall level of satisfaction with federal, state, and industry efforts to protect food from intentional contamination. Table 1 shows that nearly half of the state regulatory officials interviewed expressed satisfaction with the efforts made by federal, state, and industry to safeguard food products—though these results cannot be generalized to all state regulatory officials. Finally, most of the state officials interviewed by state auditors believed it was either “important” or “very important” for states to monitor whether companies have adopted security measures to prevent acts of deliberate contamination; 3 of the 11 states are already requiring their inspectors to do so. The vulnerability of the food supply to potential acts of deliberate contamination is a national concern. The President addressed this concern in the October 8, 2001, executive order establishing the Office of Homeland Security and adding the agriculture and food industries to the list of critical infrastructure systems needing protection from terrorist attack. The National Academies have also concluded in a recently released report that infectious agents and toxic chemicals could be used by terrorists to contaminate food-processing facilities. Among other things, the report says that FDA should act promptly to extend its Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point methodology so it might be used to deal effectively with deliberate contamination of the food supply. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also reported recently on the need to better protect our nation’s food and water supplies. These assessments underscore the need to enhance security at food- processing facilities. Although FDA and FSIS recognize that need and have taken action to encourage food processors to voluntarily adopt security measures, these actions may be insufficient. Because the agencies believe that they generally lack authority to mandate security measures and are concerned that such information would be subject to Freedom of Information Act requests, they do not collect information on industry’s voluntary implementation of security measures. The agencies are, therefore, unable to determine the extent to which food processors have voluntarily implemented such measures. Both FDA and USDA have completed risk assessments. However, without the ability to require food- processing facilities to provide information on their security measures, these federal agencies cannot fully assess industry’s efforts to prevent or reduce the vulnerability of the nation’s food supply to deliberate contamination. Similarly, they cannot advise processors on needed security enhancements. Furthermore, lacking baseline information on the facilities’ security condition, the agencies would be unprepared to advise food-processing facilities on any additional actions needed if the federal government were to go to a higher threat alert. Finally, the lack of security training for FDA food inspectors on the voluntary security guidelines issued for food processors and the limited number of FSIS inspectors that have so far received training on the voluntary security guidelines hamper the inspectors’ ability to conduct informed discussions regarding security measures with facility personnel as they are currently instructed to do. In order to reduce the risk of deliberate contamination of food products, we are recommending that the Secretary of Health and Human Services and the Secretary of Agriculture study their agencies’ existing statutes and identify what additional authorities they may need relating to security measures at food-processing facilities. On the basis of the results of these studies, the agencies should seek additional authority from the Congress, as needed. To increase field inspectors’ knowledge and understanding of food security issues and facilitate their discussions about the voluntary security guidelines with plant personnel, we are also recommending that the Secretary of Health and Human Services and the Secretary of Agriculture provide training for their agencies’ field staff on the security measures discussed in the voluntary guidelines. We provided FDA and USDA with a draft of this report for their review and comment. We received written and clarifying oral comments from each agency. The agencies also provided technical comments, which we incorporated into the report as appropriate. FDA agreed with our recommendation that it provide all food inspection personnel with training on security measures. Subsequently, FDA officials told us that the agency did not have an opinion on our recommendation that it study what additional authorities it may need relating to security measures at food- processing facilities. In its written comments, FDA stated that the report is factual and describes accurately the events and actions that FDA has taken on food security. FDA also commented that one of the goals of its voluntary guidance to industry is to heighten awareness of food security practices and that the role of its investigators is first and foremost food safety. FDA also said that it does not have sufficient security expertise to provide industry with consultation in this area. FDA further commented that although HACCP and other preventive controls are appropriate measures to enhance food safety, HACCP does not afford similar advantages for addressing deliberate contamination, tampering, and/or terrorist actions related to the food supply. Our report underscores that the role of FDA’s investigators is primarily one of food safety. Nevertheless, we believe that it is also crucial for cognizant agencies to have information about industry’s security efforts so that they can assess the extent to which the risk of deliberate contamination is being mitigated. We also believe that possessing such information is important if it becomes necessary to advise food processors on needed security enhancements. With regard to HACCP, our report does not take a position on the feasibility of using HACCP as a means to control deliberate contamination; instead, we report on the opinion of the National Academies. FDA’s comments are presented in appendix V. In its written comments, USDA agreed with the contents of our report. Subsequently, USDA’s food safety officials confirmed that the agency also agrees with the report’s recommendations. In its letter, USDA commented that it has already conducted a comprehensive risk assessment of the food supply without plant security information and that knowing whether a plant employed one or several security measures was not needed to assess the risk. Our report acknowledges that USDA has conducted a comprehensive risk assessment, but we believe that it is crucial for cognizant agencies to have information about industry’s security efforts so that they can assess the extent to which the risk of deliberate contamination is being mitigated. USDA’s comments are presented in appendix IV. As agreed with your offices, unless you publicly announce the contents of this report earlier, we plan no further distribution until 30 days from the report date. At that time, we will send copies to the Secretaries of Agriculture and Health and Human Services; the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation; the Director, Office of Management and Budget; and other interested parties. We will also make copies available to others upon request. In addition, the report will be available at no charge on the GAO Web site at http://www.gao.gov. If you have any questions about this report, please contact Maria Cristina Gobin or me at (202) 512-3841. Key contributors to this report are listed in appendix VI. To determine the extent to which the current federal food safety statutes can be effectively used to regulate security at food-processing facilities, we analyzed the Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA) and the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s (USDA) existing statutory authorities. We discussed these authorities with FDA and USDA counsel and requested a legal opinion to determine the extent to which each agency believes its existing authorities allow it to regulate food security. We then independently reviewed these authorities to draw our own conclusions. To describe the actions that FDA and USDA have taken to help food processors prevent or reduce the risk of deliberate food contamination, we met with staff from FDA and FSIS to review the voluntary guidelines issued by each agency. To better understand the provisions of the guidelines, we met with agency program staff responsible for issuing the guidelines and for receiving industry comments on it. To learn how the guidelines would be implemented, we met with FDA and USDA’s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) officials responsible for field operations and with staff from field offices in Atlanta, Georgia, and Beltsville, Maryland. Finally, to gather additional information about the vulnerability of the food supply to acts of deliberate contamination, we contacted nine experts from academia, including experts in food safety and in bioterrorism. To describe how the government is determining the extent to which food- processing companies are implementing security procedures, we asked FDA and FSIS program officials about the nature of the information they are collecting about industry security measures. We also conducted surveys of agency field personnel to obtain their observations about and knowledge of food security measures taken at facilities they regularly inspect for food safety. Our FDA survey, which was Web-based, was administered to all 150 field investigators who recorded 465 or more hours for domestic food inspection from June 1, 2001 to May 31, 2002. Our survey of FSIS staff was a telephone survey of a randomly selected stratified sample of 50 circuit supervisors. Our response rate for these surveys was higher than 85 percent for FDA and 90 percent for FSIS, and respondents included participants from all the agencies’ geographic regions. Before administering the surveys, we discussed with and obtained input from FDA and FSIS program officials. We also pretested the surveys at field locations to ensure that our questions were valid, clear, and precise and that responding to the survey did not place an undue burden on the respondents. In addition, we contacted state audit offices in all 50 states to collect information about state government actions designed to prevent the deliberate contamination of food products. Of the 50 state audit offices we contacted, only 11 agreed to help us collect this information: Arizona, Florida, Maryland, Michigan, New York, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, and Texas. To determine the extent to which the food-processing industry is implementing security measures to better protect its products against deliberate contamination, we contacted officials from 13 trade associations representing, among others, the meat and poultry, dairy, egg, and fruits and vegetables industries and the food-processing industry. We discussed the guidelines that their organizations have issued, and they described what actions their constituents are taking to protect their products. We also visited five food-processing facilities in various geographic regions to ask corporate and plant officials about the actions they have taken to protect their products and facilities against intentional contamination. These facilities included a slaughter plant as well as facilities that produce beverages and ready-to-eat products. We recognize that the efforts of these five facilities are not necessarily representative of the whole food-processing industry. To identify the concerns that the industry has about sharing sensitive information with federal agencies, we spoke with industry representatives as well as officials from the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s National Infrastructure Protection Center. We conducted our review from February through December 2002 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. In addition to those named above, John Johnson, John Nicholson, Jr., Stuart Ryba, and Margaret Skiba made key contributions to this report. Nancy Crothers, Doreen S. Feldman, Oliver Easterwood, Evan Gilman, and Ronald La Due Lake also made important contributions.","The events of September 11, 2001, have placed added emphasis on ensuring the security of the nation's food supply. GAO examined (1) whether FDA and USDA have sufficient authority under current statutes to require that food processors adopt security measures, (2) what security guidelines FDA and USDA have provided to industry, and (3) what security measures food processors have adopted. Federal food safety statutes give the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) broad authority to regulate the safety of the U.S. food supply but do not specifically authorize them to impose security requirements at food-processing facilities. However, these agencies' food safety statutes can be interpreted to provide authority to impose certain security measures. FDA believes that its statutes authorize it to regulate food security to the extent that food security and safety overlap but observes that there is little overlap between security and safety. USDA believes that it could require food processors to adopt certain security measures that are closely related to sanitary conditions inside the facility. USDA also believes that the statutes, however, cannot be interpreted to authorize the regulation of security measures that are not associated with the immediate food-processing environment, such as requiring fences, alarms, and outside lighting. Neither agency believes that it has the authority to regulate all aspects of security at food-processing facilities. Both FDA and USDA issued voluntary security guidelines to help food processors identify measures to prevent or mitigate the risk of deliberate contamination. Because these guidelines are voluntary, neither agency enforces, monitors, or documents their implementation. Both FDA and USDA have asked their inspectors to be vigilant and to discuss security with managers at food-processing facilities, but the agencies have stressed that inspectors should not enforce the implementation of security measures or document any observations because of the possible release of this information under the Freedom of Information Act and the potential for the misuse of this information. Since FDA and USDA do not monitor and document food processors' implementation of security guidelines, the extent of the industry's adoption of security measures is unknown. According to officials of trade associations and the five facilities we visited, however, food processors are implementing a range of security measures. In addition, the FDA and USDA field inspectors we surveyed indicated that most facilities have implemented some security measures, such as installing fences. However, the inspectors were less able to comment on security measures that were not as obvious, such as accounting for missing stock and implementing proper mail-handling practices. The inspectors also noted that while USDA has provided some of its field supervisory personnel with security training on the voluntary security guidelines it issued, it has not provided most of its inspectors with such training. FDA has not provided its staff with any training on the security guidelines. Without training on the security guidelines, inspectors are limited in their ability to conduct informed discussions regarding security with managers at food-processing facilities.",govreport
"OSC, which does not have in-house contracting staff, has an agreement with ARC, an office within Treasury’s Bureau of the Public Debt, to provide contracting support for a fee. As a member of the Treasury franchise fund, ARC does not receive direct appropriated funds, but instead relies on revenue from its federal agency customers to pay organizational expenses. Franchise funds are government-run, self-supporting, business-like enterprises that provide a variety of common administrative services, such as payroll processing, information technology support, and contracting. The agreement between ARC and OSC is a mechanism for interagency contracting. This type of fee-for-service procurement process generally involves three parties: the agency requiring a good or service, the agency placing the order or awarding the contract, and the contractors that provide the goods and services. The requiring agency officials determine the goods or services needed and, if applicable, prepare a statement of work, sometimes with the assistance of the ordering agency. The contracting officer at the ordering agency ensures that the contract or order is properly awarded or issued (including any required competition) and administered under applicable regulations and agency requirements. If contract performance will be ongoing, a contracting officer’s representative—generally an official at the requiring agency with relevant technical expertise—is normally designated by the contracting officer to monitor the contractor’s performance and serve as the liaison between the contracting officer and the contractor. While interagency contracting can offer the benefits of improved efficiency and timeliness, this approach needs to be effectively managed. Due to the challenges associated with interagency contracts, we recently designated interagency contracting as a governmentwide high-risk area. As authorized by OSC’s appropriation, OSC may use 5 U.S.C. § 3109 to hire intermittent consultants. Section 3109 permits agencies, when authorized by an appropriation or other statute, to acquire the temporary or intermittent services of experts or consultants. Under the statute, appointments of experts and consultants may be made without regard to competitive service provisions and classification and pay requirements. Individuals appointed under this authority may not be paid in excess of the highest rate payable for a GS-15 unless a higher rate is expressly provided for by statute or an appropriation. Under section 3109, OPM is responsible for prescribing criteria governing circumstances in which it is appropriate to employ an expert or consultant and for prescribing criteria for setting pay. Section 3109 of title 5 and OPM’s implementing regulations in 5 C.F.R. Part 304 provide for broad discretion in the appointment of experts and consultants. In promulgating its regulations, OPM recognized that agencies need to obtain outside opinion and expertise to improve federal programs, operations, and services and that by bringing in the talent and insights of experts and consultants, agencies can work more economically and effectively. OSC’s primary mission is to protect federal employees from prohibited personnel practices. It carries out this mission by conducting investigations, attempting informal resolution through discussions with the agency during the investigation phase (or by offering mediation), and, when necessary, prosecuting corrective and disciplinary actions before the MSPB. An individual may also request that the Special Counsel go before the MSPB to seek to delay an adverse personnel action, such as a termination, pending an OSC investigation. If an agency fails to remedy a prohibited personnel practice upon request by OSC, corrective action may be obtained through litigation before the MSPB. OSC may also seek disciplinary action against an employee believed to be responsible for committing a prohibited personnel practice by filing a complaint with the MSPB. However, when the disciplinary action involves presidential appointees (subject to Senate confirmation), OSC forwards its complaint against the appointee, a statement of supporting facts, and any response of the appointee to the President for appropriate action. Obtaining the assistance of OSC may be an individual’s only recourse with regard to an alleged prohibited personnel practice, unless the individual can pursue the matter with the MSPB or through the discrimination complaint process. Only employees who have been subject to an adverse action, such as a termination, demotion, or suspension beyond 14 days, may appeal to the MSPB and argue that such adverse action was the result of a prohibited personnel practice. An employee would not be able to go directly to the MSPB to complain that a geographic relocation was the result of a prohibited personnel practice. Even when an employee alleges that he or she was retaliated against for whistleblowing, he or she must first go to OSC and wait 120 days before filing directly with the MSPB, unless that employee was subject to an adverse action as noted above. An employee may also pursue resolution of a prohibited personnel practice through the federal equal employment opportunity (EEO) process if the prohibited practice relates to discrimination covered under the antidiscrimination laws enforced by the EEOC. In contracting with MPRI for the organizational assessment, several required steps were not taken: competition was not sought among Schedule vendors, and there was no convincing demonstration of why a sole-source order was necessary, the determination of the reasonableness of MPRI’s price was not OSC officials performed duties normally done by contracting officer’s representatives without authorization or training and, further, performed other duties that should have been reserved for the contracting officer. Contracting officers are generally required by the Competition in Contracting Act to promote and provide for full and open competition in soliciting offers and awarding government contracts. Use of GSA’s Schedule program is considered a competitive procedure as long as the procedures established for the program are followed. In this instance, GSA’s procedures required ordering offices to prepare a request for quotes and evaluate contractor catalogs and price lists, transmit the request to at least three contractors, and after evaluating the responses, place the order with the Schedule contractor that represented the best value. GSA’s Schedule for Management, Organizational and Business Improvement Services (MOBIS), under which the MPRI task order was issued, includes these special ordering procedures. At the time the MPRI order was placed (April 2004), neither the FAR nor GSA’s ordering procedures explicitly provided for sole-source orders under GSA Schedule contracts. However, ordering offices could meet competition requirements by properly justifying such an order. Rather than follow the required GSA special ordering procedures by placing the task order competitively on behalf of OSC, ARC approved a written sole-source justification prepared by OSC. The justification stipulated that the required services were available from only one responsible source—MPRI—and no other contractor could satisfy agency requirements. When supplies or services are available from only one responsible source and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements, full and open competition need not be provided for. However, the justification merely asserted that “no other contractor except MPRI, Inc. has the experience and background in this type of sensitive assessment.” It did not contain sufficient facts and rationale to justify a sole-source order and did not provide the minimum required information. For example, the justification did not demonstrate that the proposed contractor’s unique qualifications or the nature of the acquisition required an exception to full and open competition, describe efforts made to ensure that offers were solicited from as many potential sources as practicable, determine that the anticipated cost would be fair and reasonable, or describe the market research conducted and the results. The only support in OSC’s justification for the statement that MPRI was uniquely qualified for the task is a statement that “an informal market survey reveals that only MPRI has the demonstrated past performance in bringing together the required unbiased and highly ethical subject matter experts to complete this type of assessment in the time allocated.” However, the cited market survey does not provide a credible foundation for the conclusion that only MPRI could perform the work. The Special Counsel and his Deputy asked three vendors, including MPRI, for presentations. OSC officials could not recall how these three vendors were selected, and no documentation was available—such as a request for quotes—that set forth the requirement to which the vendors were responding. Rather, the request was communicated orally to the vendors. OSC provided us with proposals submitted by two of the vendors and stated that MPRI submitted a statement of work as its proposal. This statement of work subsequently became part of ARC’s official contract file. We found that the summary statement of OSC’s requirement and the scope of work differ among the three proposals. OSC officials explained that the two vendors’ proposals were not well-matched to what the Special Counsel had communicated to them as OSC’s requirements and that MPRI offered a “no-frills” approach that met OSC’s needs. Nevertheless, in the absence of a documented request for quotes or other solicitation tool, it is not possible to determine whether MPRI and the other vendors were responding to the same set of requirements. Further, our recent search of GSA’s Web site revealed that 1,668 vendors (1,163 of them small businesses) had contracts under GSA’s MOBIS schedule, many of which could have potentially performed the required services. The sole-source justification listed other factors as well. It stated that “there is insufficient time and no contractor’s currently have the expertise to meet Government’s requirements given the required budget limitations.” There is no explanation in the justification as to why only this contractor could perform the task within the required time frame. In fact, despite the reference to urgency, 3 days before the period of performance was to end, OSC asked ARC to change the required completion date, almost doubling the time frame from 3 to 5-½ months (with no increase in price). While acknowledging that the final, written report was a contract deliverable in the statement of work, OSC officials explained that MPRI met their needs within the 3-month period by providing a briefing on its findings that enabled OSC to begin addressing the problems that had been identified. Further, contracting without providing for full and open competition cannot be justified on the basis of concerns related to the amount of funds available. Thus, the justification’s reference to budget constraints necessitating a sole-source order is not a valid rationale. ARC contracting officials did not question or validate OSC’s justification, but told us they relied to a great extent on OSC’s input in justifying the sole- source order. They said that they are now paying closer attention to requests from customer agencies, including OSC, for sole-source orders. OSC officials told us that, because ARC did not raise questions about the justification, they assumed it was adequate. A sole-source justification is required to document a determination by the contracting officer that the anticipated cost to the government will be fair and reasonable. Neither ARC, which was responsible for doing so, nor OSC adequately documented that MPRI’s price was reasonable. Although vendors’ GSA Schedule labor rates have already been determined by GSA to be fair and reasonable, ordering agencies are required to evaluate the contractor’s price for orders requiring a statement of work. The contractor’s price is based on the labor rates in the Schedule contract, the mix of labor categories, and the level of effort required to perform the services. Normally, when ordering services from GSA Schedules that require a statement of work, the ordering office is responsible for evaluating the contractor’s level of effort and mix of labor proposed to perform the specific tasks being ordered and for making a determination as to whether the price is reasonable. ARC officials told us that they relied on OSC to conduct the price reasonableness assessment by reviewing a breakout of MPRI’s price by skill mix, number of hours, and rates for each labor category. They maintain that the minimum requirements for price reasonableness documentation were met. However, we found no documentation demonstrating that the required price evaluation had been performed. OSC officials stated that the informal market survey was adequate to determine MPRI’s price as reasonable because MPRI’s price—which the Deputy Special Counsel negotiated with the vendor—was lower than the other vendors’ prices. However, the absence of a solicitation instrument that would show all three vendors responded to the same requirement, and the disparities in the vendors’ proposed scopes of work, do not support OSC’s assertion. One of the contracting officer’s key responsibilities is ensuring that the government monitors the contractor’s performance. The contracting officer, in this case ARC, may designate a contracting officer’s representative in the requiring agency, in this case OSC, to act as the contracting officer’s technical expert and representative in the monitoring and administration of a contract or task order. ARC’s standard designation letter to contracting officer’s representatives outlines the scope of these responsibilities, including such things as monitoring the contractor’s performance, representing the government in meetings with the contractor, keeping the contracting officer informed, and reviewing the contractor’s invoices. ARC follows Treasury’s training program for contracting officer’s representatives, which consists of a basic acquisition course of at least 24 hours that includes pre-award, post-award, and procurement ethics training. ARC contracting staff named OSC’s former human resource chief, who had taken the required training, as the contracting officer’s representative for the MPRI task order. However, two other OSC officials not named by ARC, the Special Assistant and Director of Management and Budget and the Deputy Special Counsel, who had not received the training, effectively acted in the role of contracting officer’s representatives on the MPRI order. In an April 20, 2004, e-mail to OSC staff, the Special Counsel named the Special Assistant as the liaison between the agency and the contractor. The statement of work names this official as the “governing authority” for the effort and as responsible for coordinating with the contractor on “any other direct costs” and certain travel requirements. Also, the Deputy Special Counsel was responsible for approving MPRI’s contract execution plan and the contract deliverables. Further, ARC’s delegation letter to contracting officer’s representatives prohibits the delegation of or responsibility for certain duties, such as soliciting proposals, making commitments or promises to a contractor relating to the award of a contract, and negotiating the price with the contractor. The Special Counsel and Deputy Special Counsel, as discussed above, solicited proposals from three vendors, and the Deputy negotiated the final price with MPRI, functions that should have been performed by the ARC contracting officer. ARC contracting staff were not aware that the OSC officials had performed these duties until we informed them. They said that only the former human resource chief had received the training and authorization to act as a contracting officer’s representative. OSC officials said that ARC, as their contracting office, never told them they were not following proper contracting practices. The tasks specified in the statement of work for the consultant that OSC hired on March 17, 2004, and that he completed before his departure were consistent with OPM criteria for appropriate uses of expert and consultant appointments. The employee, who was employed on an intermittent basis, was tasked with two major lines of work related to efficiency and curriculum development. OSC management expressed confidence in his qualifications and used its discretion to both hire him and set his compensation rate. OPM regulations permit agency heads to establish expert or consultant pay rates, but in doing so to consider specified factors, including level of difficulty of the work, qualifications of the expert or consultant, and pay rates of individuals performing comparable work. At the suggestion of the Special Counsel, OSC officials hired Alan J. Hicks as an intermittent employee on March 17, 2004, using the appointment authority under 5 U.S.C. § 3109. According to the appointment paperwork, Mr. Hicks’s appointment was to last from March 17, 2004, until March 16, 2005, and he was to work an intermittent schedule. His pay rate was set slightly below the highest rate for a GS-15. Mr. Hicks resigned his appointment effective October 24, 2004. During the 7 months Mr. Hicks was employed by OSC, he worked a total of 123 hours for a total of $6,621.09 in pay. Before hiring Mr. Hicks, the Special Counsel identified him as a possible consultant based on prior knowledge of Mr. Hicks’s work as the headmaster of a private secondary school. The Deputy Special Counsel told us that he justified Mr. Hicks’s pay on the basis of his qualifications— specifically, his experience as headmaster and his educational level. He also noted that the Special Counsel had worked with Mr. Hicks and respected his opinion and judgment. According to Mr. Hicks’s resume, during the 10 years of his headmaster position, he was responsible for a number of administrative functions, including designing and writing student curricula, recruiting and training faculty and staff, establishing financial and organizational structures of the school, hiring and management decisions, as well as teaching history, logic, and biology. According to his resume, Mr. Hicks had also taught at the college level. OPM regulations provide that agencies may appoint qualified experts or consultants to an expert or consultant position that requires only intermittent and/or temporary employment. While OPM regulations do not establish specific criteria for determining qualifications, they do generally describe the expectations for such positions and what constitutes appropriate tasks for experts and consultants to perform. For example, the regulations describe a consultant as a person who can provide valuable and pertinent advice generally drawn from a high degree of broad administrative, professional, or technical knowledge or experience. Furthermore, a consultant position is one that requires providing advice, views, opinions, alternatives, or recommendations on a temporary or intermittent basis on issues, problems, or questions presented by a federal official. The regulations also provide examples of inappropriate uses of expert/consultant appointments, including work performed by the agency’s regular employees. Mr. Hicks’s tasks were related to addressing OSC’s backlog that we identified in our March 2004 report. Specifically, an OSC official noted that his experience in curricula development at the boarding school was viewed as key to cross-train employees in different units so those employees could be utilized in a number of ways to address workload. According to the OSC official, Mr. Hicks’s efforts would complement those of MPRI. The official said he was confident that Mr. Hicks was fully qualified to do the work, and that OSC used management discretion to approve the appointment. Another official observed that Mr. Hicks provided both an outside perspective and experience that regular OSC staff did not have. Officials also said that although Mr. Hicks only worked at OSC for a short time, the agency was pleased with the value he added. Both the duties set out in Mr. Hicks’s statement of work, as well as those duties he actually performed, were consistent with OPM regulations. According to the statement of work prepared by the human resource chief at the Deputy Special Counsel’s direction, Mr. Hicks was to (1) review and analyze OSC program policies and procedures for efficiency and make recommendations and develop written revisions to these policies and procedures and (2) develop a long-term training curriculum and deliver training. Shortly before he terminated his consultant work for OSC, Mr. Hicks submitted a report outlining the work that he performed. In his report, Mr. Hicks made a number of observations on his concurrence with MPRI’s conclusions. The report also said he was involved in a number of other tasks, including examining operational training manuals, meeting with staff concerning the procedures for handling assisting with and attending the Special Counsel’s testimony before a preparing a paper for presentation at a staff retreat on philosophical matters related to work, meeting with MPRI to discuss its assessments and to share his observations based on his work, and having numerous conversations with the Special Counsel concerning the assessment team, his recommendations for curriculum and training, and the need for streamlined procedures. While most of the tasks that Mr. Hicks actually performed were consistent with those enumerated in his statement of work, Mr. Hicks also worked on whistleblower disclosure cases. According to an OSC official, Mr. Hicks spent approximately 25 percent of his time working through 50 disclosure case files. The OSC official stated that Mr. Hicks was not provided disclosure case files that contained sensitive information for which a security clearance would have been required. While Mr. Hicks noted in his report that this work on the disclosure cases “served the dual purpose of analysis of procedures and a reduction of backlog,” an OSC official stated that Mr. Hicks’s efforts were related to an analysis of the process of handling disclosures and not the type of efforts OSC’s disclosure unit employees perform in handling such cases. According to the OSC official, while Mr. Hicks contacted some of the whistleblowers directly, it was for the purpose of determining those individuals’ impressions about the process. This official stated that these activities were performed at the initiative of the Special Counsel and his senior staff, in order for Mr. Hicks to gain a better understanding of those processes and procedures specified in the statement of work. This official stated that prior to Mr. Hicks’s arrival at OSC, the Special Counsel forwarded to Mr. Hicks statutory provisions on OSC’s duties relating to disclosures from whistleblowers, including the obligation of OSC to maintain the confidentiality of a whistleblower’s identity. Although OSC employees, like other federal employees, can seek redress for alleged prohibited personnel practices through OSC, this may be unworkable for OSC employees in certain circumstances. Two other agencies with redress roles, MSPB and EEOC, have acknowledged the need to avoid conflicts when their employees have complaints and have taken steps to avoid such conflicts when their employees use their agency’s respective redress processes. Title 5 of the United States Code protects federal employees, including OSC employees, from prohibited personnel practices. OSC employees who believe that a prohibited personnel practice has occurred may seek redress from OSC. OSC employees may also seek redress through appealing adverse actions to the MSPB and filing EEO complaints. According to OSC officials, there are two ways in which an OSC employee could bring a prohibited personnel practice allegation within OSC. First, OSC employees may use the agency’s administrative grievance system. If fact-finding is needed for a complaint filed against OSC staff, an OSC employee who has not been involved in the matter being grieved and, when possible, does not occupy a position subordinate to any official involved in the matter being grieved, is selected to conduct a review and prepare a report. Ideally, that employee is also located in a different geographic area; for example, an OSC employee in Dallas could be assigned to a complaint filed in Washington, D.C. OSC officials stated that this would ensure objectivity and independence in the processing of the complaint. Fact- finding is conducted informally and includes the collection of documents and statements of witnesses, as necessary. The grievant’s second-level supervisor would render a decision based upon the fact-finder’s report and any comments on the report provided by the grievant. The grievant may appeal this decision to the Deputy Special Counsel, or, if the matter was grieved to the Deputy Special Counsel in the first instance, to the Special Counsel. Both current and former OSC officials stated that this process could be successfully used when the prohibited personnel practice allegation relates to the actions of an official below the Deputy Special Counsel level. However, if the administrative grievance system were to be used to address grievances against the Special Counsel or the Deputy Special Counsel, there would be a conflict of interest since the final decision maker in this process is the Special Counsel. Second, OSC officials stated that OSC employees who believe a prohibited personnel practice has occurred can file a complaint with OSC in the same fashion as an individual from outside OSC. However, OSC employees do not have an outside agency to represent them in an independent manner— the role that OSC plays for non-OSC employees in cases involving prohibited personnel practices. When an employee raises a prohibited personnel practice allegation against the Special Counsel, addressing such an allegation within OSC becomes unworkable because, OSC officials stated, all OSC employees ultimately report to the Special Counsel. OSC officials also stated that there cannot be an independent review when the employee performing the investigation reports to the individual being investigated. According to former and current OSC officials, the difficulty also extends to allegations against the Deputy Special Counsel because the Deputy Special Counsel, who is typically a noncareer senior executive, has a confidential relationship with the Special Counsel. According to the previous Special Counsel, an effort among senior staff to establish procedures for handling OSC employee allegations of prohibited personnel practices against senior OSC officers, including the Special Counsel, was initiated during her tenure. However, the effort was not completed, she said, noting that OSC staff did not reach a consensus over what the alternative process should be for handling complaints against the Special Counsel. The previous Special Counsel and current OSC officials who were involved in this effort told us that one of the options being considered was to have the matter investigated by an outside inspector general. At the time, however, concern was expressed about allowing inspectors general, who were subject to OSC’s investigative and prosecutorial authority, to investigate the Special Counsel. The potential difficulties described above were recently illustrated when a complaint was filed anonymously against the Special Counsel on behalf of a number of OSC employees. The complainants requested that the complaint be referred to the chairman of the PCIE for an independent investigation, including a recommendation for corrective or disciplinary action. The PCIE is an interagency council, including presidentially appointed inspectors general, charged with promoting integrity and efficiency in federal programs. The complaint stated that OSC could not investigate these allegations because the Special Counsel could not oversee an investigation of which he is the subject and that all OSC staff are his subordinates. The complaint further observed that the complainants’ ability to remain anonymous would be jeopardized if any OSC staff were assigned to work on the investigation. As discussed above, current OSC policy and procedures do not provide for special handling of complaints against the Special Counsel or the Deputy Special Counsel. The Deputy Special Counsel told us that he and the Special Counsel agreed that OSC should not handle the complaint, and subsequently forwarded it to the PCIE’s Integrity Committee and notified the chair of the PCIE. In mid- October, 2005, the chair assigned OPM’s inspector general to conduct the investigation. Two other agencies in the executive branch with major roles in ensuring the protection of employee rights, the MSPB and EEOC, have taken steps to address potential conflicts of interest when their own employees use their agencies’ respective redress processes. The MSPB is an independent quasi-judicial agency established to protect federal merit systems against prohibited personnel practices and to ensure adequate protection for employees against abuses by agency management. MSPB carries out this mission, in part, by adjudicating federal employee appeals of adverse personnel actions. The MSPB has developed regulations which state that MSPB employee appeals are not to be heard by board-employed administrative judges who hear appeals from employees of other federal agencies, but instead are to be heard by administrative law judges (ALJ). According to the MSPB General Counsel, MSPB does not employ its own ALJs; rather, MSPB has a memorandum of understanding with the National Labor Relations Board to use its ALJs for MSPB employee appeals and other matters, including whistleblower retaliation cases brought by OSC. MSPB regulations further provide that the board’s policy is to insulate the adjudication of its own employees’ appeals from agency involvement as much as possible. The regulations provide that if an initial decision rendered by the ALJ is appealed to the board, the initial decision will not be altered unless there has been “harmful procedural irregularity” in the proceedings or there is a clear error of law. According to the MSPB General Counsel, this provides the board with very limited review authority. Finally, the regulations state what procedures are to be followed if a board member must recuse himself or herself from a specific case. The EEOC is responsible for enforcing the federal sector employment discrimination prohibitions contained in the federal antidiscrimination statutes, including Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended. As part of this responsibility, EEOC provides for the adjudication of complaints and hearing of appeals. As is the case for all individuals who file a formal complaint of discrimination, EEOC employees may either request a hearing before an administrative judge or a final decision by the agency itself. However, according to EEOC officials, when EEOC employees request a hearing over their complaint of discrimination, such hearings are not to be conducted by the administrative judges employed by EEOC, but rather through contract administrative judges. EEOC officials state that using contract administrative judges is necessary to preserve the neutrality of the process, since EEOC’s administrative judges are coworkers of any EEOC complainant. EEOC officials also told us that if an employee of its Office of Equal Opportunity (OEO), EEOC’s own EEO office, raises an allegation of discrimination, the matter is sent outside the agency to another agency’s EEO office for informal counseling, investigation, and/or mediation to guard against potential conflicts of interest within the OEO. Steps can be taken to ensure that OSC employees have alternative avenues of recourse when their prohibited personnel practice allegations involve the Special Counsel or the Deputy Special Counsel. Potential options are discussed below. However, unlike the MSPB and the EEOC, which have taken steps to address potential conflicts of interest when their own employees use their respective redress processes, OSC would need explicit authority for implementing such options. OSC employees could be afforded an external investigation of their prohibited personnel practice allegations against the Special Counsel or Deputy Special Counsel through an independent entity. Most of the current and former OSC officials we spoke with acknowledged that the option of such an external investigation is warranted. If such an external investigation were authorized, it may be desirable to also provide the results of the investigation to the President, who has the authority to take appropriate corrective action. However, OSC would need specific authority to implement this option since OSC does not have the mechanism to provide for such investigations. OSC employees could be afforded expanded rights to appeal directly to MSPB that would specifically encompass prohibited personnel actions involving the Special Counsel or the Deputy Special Counsel. As discussed above, OSC employees, as is the case with other federal employees, can take allegations of prohibited personnel practices to the MSPB only when certain adverse actions have been taken against those employees. One OSC official observed that care should be taken in expanding jurisdiction so as to prevent minor personnel actions from being appealable to the board. Since the MSPB appeals process is in statute, this option would require legislation for implementation. OSC employees who believe a prohibited personnel practice has occurred can file a complaint with OSC in the same fashion as an individual from outside the agency. However, OSC employees do not have an external, independent agency like OSC to represent them. This becomes particularly important when the complaint is filed against the Special Counsel or the Deputy Special Counsel. When an employee raises a prohibited personnel practice allegation against the Special Counsel, addressing such an allegation within OSC becomes unworkable because OSC employees ultimately report to the Special Counsel, including the complainant and any staff who would conduct an internal investigation. This difficulty extends to allegations against the Deputy Special Counsel because this individual has a confidential relationship with the Special Counsel. Steps could be taken to ensure that OSC employees, who cannot effectively obtain the services of OSC in addressing allegations of prohibited personnel practices, have alternative avenues of redress. Adequate management oversight is critical to ensuring that, in an interagency contracting environment, the requiring agency and the agency ordering the services on its behalf work together to follow proper contracting procedures. In agreeing to issue the sole-source order for the organizational assessment despite the flawed justification, and in being uninvolved in and unaware of the pre- and post-award activities conducted by OSC officials, ARC contracting officials neglected to fulfill their responsibilities. For their part, OSC officials demonstrated a lack of awareness of their responsibilities in the process of engaging MPRI and overseeing the contractor’s work. Due to the unique nature of OSC and the difficulties involved when a prohibited personnel practice allegation is made against the Special Counsel or the Deputy Special Counsel, Congress should consider affording OSC employees (and former employees and applicants for employment) alternative means of addressing prohibited personnel practice allegations other than going through OSC. These means could include establishing (1) a right to an external investigation through an independent entity, where the entity would forward its findings to the President, who would decide the appropriate action, as is done when OSC handles allegations of prohibited personnel practices against Senate- confirmed presidential appointees; or (2) an expansion of the personnel actions that could be the basis for an appeal directly to the MSPB. We recommend that the Director of ARC’s Division of Procurement take the following two actions to ensure that (1) documents prepared by program offices requesting contracting assistance—such as statements of work and sole-source justifications—are carefully reviewed for compliance with competition requirements and (2) ARC contracting staff, through regular communication with the program offices they support, ensure that only authorized program officials act as contracting officer’s representatives. We also recommend that the Special Counsel put in place procedures to ensure that only those officials who have taken the required training and been designated as contracting officer’s representatives act in that role and that program staff do not exceed their authority in interacting with contractors. On September 23, 2005, we provided a draft of this report to OSC and to ARC for review and comment. OSC’s written response is included in appendix I, and ARC’s written response is included in appendix II. OSC and ARC agreed with our recommendations. However, OSC suggested several wording changes to the report and expressed concern about the tone of the section on the sole-source order with MPRI. While we clarified our wording in several places, we did not make other changes suggested by OSC in its comment letter for the reasons discussed below. OSC recommended we add a paragraph that, in addition to making reference to our earlier report on case backlogs at OSC (which is discussed in the first paragraph of our current report), would make other points that are already addressed in our report. Thus, we did not include OSC’s suggested language. OSC pointed out that ARC, as the contracting office, did not question the sole-source justification and that, if it had done so, another approach could have been taken for the procurement. Our report already clearly reflects the fact that this was ARC’s responsibility and that ARC contracting personnel did not question the validity of the sole-source justification but, rather, relied on OSC’s rationale. OSC suggested we revise the wording in our report to state that program staff participated in negotiations with MPRI, rather than state that the Deputy Special Counsel negotiated the price with the company. Our discussions with OSC officials—including one with the Deputy himself— support our finding that the Deputy negotiated the final price with MPRI, and we have added the word “final” to make that clear. There is no evidence that ARC “set the final price,” as OSC suggests; rather, ARC issued a task order using the final price provided to it by OSC. OSC also took exception to our statements that the Deputy Special Counsel was responsible for approving MPRI’s contract execution plan and contract deliverables and suggested we change the wording to “Also, OSC program officials were included in the approval process for MPRI’s contract execution plan and contract deliverables.” Again, the evidence supports our finding as stated in the report. In fact, the contract’s statement of work names the Deputy as the contracting officer’s representative, as the official responsible for approving MPRI’s contract execution plan, and as the recipient of the contractor’s monthly reports. Further, the contract execution plan is addressed to the Deputy and it identifies him as the contracting officer’s representative. As agreed with your offices, unless you publicly announce the contents of this report earlier, we plan no further distribution until 30 days from the date of this letter. At that time, we will send copies of this report to OSC, the Bureau of the Public Debt, and interested parties. In addition, the report will be available at no charge on GAO’s Web site at http://www.gao.gov. Contact points for our Offices of Congressional Relations and Public Affairs may be found on the last page of this report. If you or your staff have questions about this report, please call me at (202) 512-9490. Key contributors to this report included Kimberly Gianopoulos, Karin Fangman, Sharon Hogan, Michele Mackin, and Adam Vodraska.","In January 2005, the U.S. Office of Special Counsel (OSC) implemented a plan, in part, to address a backlog of pending cases. This report discusses actions related to the development of this plan, including whether required practices and procedures were followed in contracting for the services of a management consulting company and in hiring an intermittent employee as a consultant. Also, the report identifies avenues of redress available to OSC employees for filing prohibited personnel practice allegations against OSC, and other redress options that could be made available. At OSC's request, the Administrative Resource Center (ARC), an office within the U.S. Department of the Treasury's Bureau of the Public Debt which provides OSC with contracting support for a fee, issued a $140,000 sole-source task order for an organizational assessment to a consulting firm, Military Professional Resources, Inc. (MPRI). In doing so, several required steps were not taken: competition was not sought among Schedule vendors and there was no convincing demonstration of why a sole-source order was necessary; the determination of the reasonableness of MPRI's price was not documented; and OSC officials performed duties normally done by contracting officer's representatives without authorization or training and, further, performed other duties that should have been reserved for the contracting officer. ARC officials told us they relied largely on OSC's input in justifying the sole-source order and determining MPRI's price to be reasonable and that they were unaware that the OSC officials had performed contracting-related duties. They told us that they are now paying particular attention to requests from their customers, including OSC, for sole-source orders. OSC officials said that they relied on ARC's expertise, as their contracting office, to ensure that proper contracting procedures were followed. The tasks specified in the statement of work for the consultant that OSC hired as an intermittent employee and that he completed before his departure were consistent with Office of Personnel Management criteria for appropriate uses of expert and consultant appointments. The intermittent employee was tasked with two major lines of work related to efficiency and curriculum development. OSC management expressed confidence in the individual's qualifications and was within its discretion to both hire him and set his level of compensation. While OSC employees, like other federal employees, are protected against prohibited personnel practices and may seek redress from OSC in making such allegations, this option becomes unworkable because of potential conflicts of interest when an OSC employee raises such an allegation of a prohibited personnel practice against either of the two top OSC officials. Two other federal agencies with redress roles, the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB) and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, have taken steps to address potential conflicts of interest when their own employees use their agency's respective redress processes. Steps could be taken to ensure that OSC employees have alternative avenues of recourse; for example, they could have an external investigation conducted through an independent body or broader appeal rights to the MSPB. OSC could not independently implement these options, and would need to be given authority to do so.",govreport
"VA’s mission is to promote the health, welfare, and dignity of all veterans in recognition of their service to the nation by ensuring that they receive medical care, benefits, social support, and lasting memorials. It is the second largest federal department and, in addition to its central office located in Washington, D.C., has field offices throughout the United States, as well as the U.S. territories and the Philippines. The department’s three major components—the Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA), the Veterans Health Administration (VHA), and the National Cemetery Administration (NCA)—are primarily responsible for carrying out its mission. More specifically, VBA provides a variety of benefits to veterans and their families including disability compensation, educational opportunities, assistance with home ownership, and life insurance. VHA provides health care services, including primary care and specialized care, and it performs research and development to improve veterans’ needs. Lastly, NCA provides burial and memorial benefits to veterans and their families. Collectively, the three components rely on approximately 340,000 employees to provide services and benefits. These employees work in 167 VA medical centers, approximately 800 community-based outpatient clinics, 300 veterans centers, 56 regional offices, and 131 national and 90 state or tribal cemeteries situated throughout the nation. The use of IT is critically important to VA’s efforts to provide benefits and services to veterans. As such, the department operates and maintains an IT infrastructure that is intended to provide the backbone necessary to meet the day-to-day operational needs of its medical centers, veteran- facing systems, benefits delivery systems, memorial services, and all other IT systems supporting the department’s mission. The infrastructure is to provide for data storage, transmission, and communications requirements necessary to ensure the delivery of reliable, available, and responsive support to all VA staff offices and administration customers, as well as veterans. Toward this end, the department operates approximately 240 information systems, manages 314,000 desktop computers and 30,000 laptops, and administers nearly 460,000 network user accounts for employees and contractors to facilitate providing benefits and health care to veterans. These systems are used for the determination of benefits, benefits claims processing, patient admission to hospitals and clinics, and access to health records, among other services. For example, VBA relies on VBMS to collect and store information such as military service records, medical examinations, and treatment records from VA, DOD, and private medical service providers. IT also is widely used and critically important to supporting the department in delivering health care to veterans. VHA’s systems provide capabilities to establish and maintain electronic health records that health care providers and other clinical staff use to view patient information in inpatient, outpatient, and long-term care settings. Specifically, the Veterans Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture, known as VistA, consists of many computer applications and modules that collect, among other things, information about a veteran’s demographics, allergies, procedures, immunizations, and medical diagnoses. However, a number of VA’s systems are old. For example, our recent report on legacy systems used by federal agencies identified 2 of the department’s systems as being over 50 years old and among the 10 oldest investments and/or systems that were reported by 12 selected agencies. Personnel and Accounting Integrated Data (PAID)—This 53-year old system automates time and attendance for employees, timekeepers, payroll, and supervisors. It is written in Common Business Oriented Language (COBOL), a programming language developed in the late 1950s and early 1960s, and runs on IBM mainframes. VA plans to replace PAID with a project called Human Resources Information System Shared Service Center in 2017. Benefits Delivery Network (BDN)—This 51-year old system tracks claims filed by veterans for benefits, eligibility, and dates of death. It is a suite of COBOL mainframe applications. VA has general plans to roll the capabilities of BDN into another system, but there is no firm date associated with this transition. To address these obsolete systems that are in need of modernization or replacement, we recommended that the Secretary of Veterans Affairs direct the department’s Chief Information Officer (CIO) to identify and plan to modernize or replace legacy systems, as needed, and consistent with draft OMB guidance, including time frames, activities to be performed, and functions to be replaced or enhanced. VA concurred with our recommendation and stated that it is planning to retire PAID and BDN in 2017 and 2018, respectively. In 2014, VA issued its 6-year strategic plan, which emphasizes the department’s goal of increasing veterans’ access to benefits and services, eliminating the disability claims backlog, and ending veteran homelessness. According to the plan, the department intends to improve access to benefits and services through the use of improved technology to provide veterans with access to more effective care management. The plan also calls for VA to eliminate the disability claims backlog by fully implementing an electronic claims process that is intended to reduce processing time and increase accuracy. Further, the department has an initiative under way that provides services, such as health care, housing assistance, and job training, to end veteran homelessness. Toward this end, VA is working with other agencies, such as the Department of Health and Human Services, to implement more coordinated data entry systems to streamline and facilitate access to appropriate housing and services. VA reported spending about $3.9 billion to improve and maintain its IT resources in fiscal year 2015. Specifically, the department reported spending approximately $548 million on new systems development efforts, approximately $2.3 billion on maintaining existing systems, and approximately $1 billion on payroll and administration. For fiscal year 2016, the department received appropriations of about $4.1 billion for IT. Further, for fiscal year 2017, the department’s budget request included nearly $4.3 billion for IT. The department requested approximately $471 million for new systems development efforts, approximately $2.5 billion for maintaining existing systems, and approximately $1.3 billion for payroll and administration. In addition, in its 2017 budget submission, the department requested appropriations to make improvements in a number of areas, including: veterans’ access to health care, to include enhancing health care- related systems, standardizing immunization data, and expanding telehealth services ($186.7 million); veterans’ access to benefits by modernizing systems supporting benefits delivery, such as VBMS and the Veterans Services Network ($236.3 million); veterans’ experiences with VA by focusing on integrated service delivery and streamlined identification processes ($171.3 million); VA employees’ experiences by enhancing internal IT systems ($13 information security, including implementing strong authentication, ensuring repeatable processes and procedures, adopting modern technology, and enhancing the detection of cyber vulnerabilities and protection from cyber threats ($370.1 million). VA’s CIO has recently initiated an effort to transform the focus and functions of the Office of Information and Technology (OI&T), in response to the Secretary’s goal of achieving a more veteran-focused organization. The CIO’s transformation strategy, initiated in January 2016, calls for OI&T to focus on stabilizing and streamlining processes, mitigating weaknesses highlighted in GAO assessments, and improving outcomes by institutionalizing a new set of IT management capabilities. As part of this transformation, the CIO began transitioning the oversight and accountability of IT projects to a new project management process called the Veteran-focused Integration Process in January 2016, in an effort to streamline systems development and the delivery of new IT capabilities. The CIO also intends to establish five new functions within OI&T: The enterprise program management office is to serve as OI&T’s portfolio management and project tracking organization. The account management function is to be responsible for managing the IT needs of VA’s major components. The quality and compliance function is to be responsible for establishing policy governance and standards and ensuring adherence to them. The data management organization is expected to improve both service delivery and the veteran experience by engaging with data stewards to ensure the accuracy and security of the information collected by VA. The strategic sourcing function is to be responsible for establishing an approach to fulfilling the agency’s requirements with vendors that provide solutions to those requirements, managing vendor selection, tracking vendor performance and contract deliverables, and sharing insights on new technologies and capabilities to improve the workforce knowledge base. According to the CIO, the transformation strategy is expected to be completed by the first quarter of fiscal year 2017, although the vast majority of the plan, including establishing the five new functions, is to be executed by the end of fiscal year 2016. In February 2015, we designated VA health care as a high-risk area. Among the five broad areas contributing to our determination was the department’s IT challenges. Of particular concern was the failed modernization of a system, suspended development of another system, and the extent of system interoperability—the ability to exchange information—with DOD, which present risks to the timeliness, quality, and safety of VA health care. We have reported on the department’s failed attempts to modernize its outpatient appointment scheduling system, which is about 30 years old. Among the problems cited by VA staff responsible for scheduling appointments are that the system requires them to use commands requiring many keystrokes and that it does not allow them to view multiple screens at once. Schedulers must open and close multiple screens to check a provider’s or a clinic’s full availability when scheduling a medical appointment, which is time-consuming and can lead to errors. In addition, we reported in May 2010 that after spending an estimated $127 million over 9 years on its outpatient scheduling system project, VA had not implemented any of the planned system’s capabilities and was essentially starting over by beginning a new initiative to build or purchase another scheduling system. We also noted that VA had not developed a project plan or schedule for the new initiative, stating that it intended to do so after determining whether to build or purchase the new application. We recommended that the department take six actions to improve key systems development and acquisition processes essential to the second outpatient scheduling system effort. The department generally concurred with our recommendations, but as of May 2016, had not addressed four of the six recommendations. Further, in January 2014, we reported that the inability to electronically share data across facilities had led VA to suspend the development of a system that would have allowed it to electronically store and retrieve information about surgical implants (including tissue products) and the veterans who receive them nationwide. Having this capability would be particularly important in the event that a manufacturer or the Food and Drug Administration ordered a recall on a medical device or tissue product because of safety concerns. In the absence of a centralized system, at the time of our report, VA clinicians tracked information about implanted items using stand-alone systems or spreadsheets that were not shared across VA facilities, which made it difficult for the department to quickly determine which patients may have received an implant that was subject to a safety recall. Additionally, we reported in February 2014 that VA and DOD lacked electronic health record systems that permit the efficient electronic exchange of patient health information as military service members transition from DOD to VA health care systems. Since 1998, VA and DOD have undertaken a patchwork of initiatives intended to allow their health information systems to exchange information and increase interoperability. Among others, these have included initiatives to share viewable data in existing (legacy) systems, link and share computable data between the departments’ updated heath data repositories, and jointly develop a single integrated system. In March 2011, the secretaries of the two departments announced that they would develop a new, joint integrated electronic health record system (referred to as iEHR). This was intended to replace the departments’ separate systems with a single common system, thus sidestepping many of the challenges they had previously encountered in trying to achieve interoperability. However, in February 2013, about 2 years after initiating iEHR, the secretaries announced that the departments were abandoning plans to develop a joint system, due to concerns about the program’s cost, schedule, and ability to meet deadlines. The Interagency Program Office (IPO) reported spending about $564 million on iEHR between October 2011 and June 2013. In place of the iEHR initiative, VA stated that it would modernize VistA, while DOD planned to buy a commercially available system. The departments stated that they would ensure interoperability between these updated systems, as well as with other public and private health care providers. Our February 2014 report noted that the departments did not substantiate their claims that it would be less expensive and faster than developing a single, joint system. We have also noted that the departments’ plans to modernize their two separate systems were duplicative and stressed that their decisions should be justified by comparing the costs and schedules of alternate approaches. We therefore recommended that the departments should develop cost and schedule estimates that would include all elements of their approach (i.e., modernizing both departments’ health information systems and establishing interoperability between them) and compare them with estimates of the cost and schedule for the single-system approach. If the planned approach were projected to cost more or take longer, we recommended that they provide a rationale for pursuing such an approach. VA and DOD agreed with our prior recommendations and stated that initial comparison indicated that the current approach would be more cost effective. However, as of June 2016, the departments have not provided us with a comparison of the estimated costs of their current and previous approaches. Moreover, with respect to their assertions that separate systems could be achieved faster, both departments have developed schedules that indicate their separate modernizations are not expected to be completed until after the 2017 planned completion date for the previous single-system approach. To further highlight the department’s IT challenges, our most recent report in August 2015 on VA’s efforts to achieve electronic health record interoperability with DOD noted that the departments have engaged in several near-term efforts focused on expanding interoperability between their existing electronic health record systems. For example, the departments analyzed data related to 25 “domains” identified by the Interagency Clinical Informatics Board and mapped health data in their existing systems to standards identified by the IPO. The departments also expanded the functionality of their Joint Legacy Viewer—a tool that allows clinicians to view certain health care data from both departments in a single interface. In addition, VA and DOD have moved forward with plans to modernize their respective electronic health record systems. For its part, VA has developed a number of plans for its VistA modernization effort (known as VistA Evolution), including an interoperability plan and a road map describing functional capabilities to be deployed through fiscal year 2018. According to the road map, the first set of capabilities was to be delivered in September 2014, and was to include access to the Joint Legacy Viewer, among other things. VA’s CIO has asserted that the department has continued to improve VistA. However, the CIO also recently indicated that the department is taking a step back in reconsidering how best to meet VA’s future electronic health record system needs and has not determined whether to modernize VistA or to replace it with an off-the- shelf system. Nevertheless, a significant concern that we identified is that VA (and DOD) had not identified outcome-oriented goals and metrics that would more clearly define what they aim to achieve from their interoperability efforts and the value and benefits these efforts are intended to yield. As we have stressed in our prior work, assessing the performance of a program should include measuring its outcomes in terms of the results of products or services. In this case, such outcomes could include improvements in the quality of health care or clinician satisfaction. Establishing outcome-oriented goals and metrics is essential to determining whether a program is delivering value. In our August 2015 report, we stressed that using an effective outcome- based approach could provide VA with a more accurate picture of its progress toward achieving interoperability with DOD and the value and benefits generated. Accordingly, we recommended that the departments, working with the IPO, establish a time frame for identifying outcome- oriented metrics, define related goals as a basis for determining the extent to which the departments’ modernized electronic health record systems are achieving interoperability, and update IPO guidance accordingly. VA concurred with our recommendations and has told us that it has initiated actions in response to them. In September 2015, we reported that VBA had made progress in developing and implementing VBMS, its system that is to be used for processing disability benefit claims. Specifically, it had deployed the initial version of the system to all of its regional offices as of June 2013. Further, after initial deployment, VBA continued developing and implementing additional system functionality and enhancements to support the electronic processing of disability compensation claims. As a result, 95 percent of records related to veterans’ disability claims are electronic and reside in the system. Nevertheless, we found that VBMS was not able to fully support disability and pension claims, as well as appeals processing. Specifically, while the Under Secretary for Benefits stated in March 2013 that the development of the system was expected to be completed in 2015, implementation of functionality to fully support electronic claims processing was delayed beyond 2015. In addition, VBA had not produced a plan that identified when the system will be completed. Accordingly, holding VA management accountable for meeting a time frame and for demonstrating progress was difficult. As VA continues its efforts to complete the development and implementation of VBMS, we reported in September 2015 that three areas could benefit from increased management attention. Cost estimating: The program office did not have a reliable estimate of the cost for completing the system. Without such an estimate, VA management and the department’s stakeholders had a limited view of the system’s future resource needs, and the program risked not having sufficient funding to complete development and implementation of the system. System availability: Although VBA had improved its performance regarding system availability to users, it had not established system response time goals. Without such goals, users did not have an expectation of the system response times they could anticipate and management did not have an indication of how well the system performs relative to performance goals. System defects: While the program had actively managed system defects, a recent system release included unresolved defects that impacted system performance and users’ experiences. Continuing to deploy releases with large numbers of defects that reduce system functionality could adversely affect users’ ability to process disability claims in an efficient manner. We also found in our September 2015 report that VA had not conducted a customer satisfaction survey that would allow the department to compile data on how users view the system’s performance, and ultimately, to develop goals for improving the system. GAO’s 2014 survey of VBMS users found that a majority of them were satisfied with the system, but decision review officers were considerably less satisfied. Although the results of our survey provided VBA with data about users’ satisfaction with VBMS, the absence of user satisfaction goals limited the utility of survey results. Specifically, without having established goals to define user satisfaction, VBA did not have a basis for gauging the success of its efforts to promote satisfaction with the system, or for identifying areas where its efforts to complete development and implementation of the system might need attention. In our September 2015 report, we recommended that VA develop a plan with a time frame and a reliable cost estimate for completing VBMS, establish goals for system response time, minimize the incidence of high and medium severity system defects for future VBMS releases, assess user satisfaction, and establish satisfaction goals to promote improvement. As we stressed in our report, attention to these issues can improve VA’s efforts to effectively complete the development and implementation of VBMS. Fully addressing our recommendations, as VA agreed to do, should help the department give appropriate attention to these issues. As we reported in May 2016, VA’s expenditures for its care in the community programs, the number of veterans for whom VA has purchased care, and the number of claims processed by VHA have all grown considerably in recent years. The substantial increase in utilization of VA care in the community programs poses staffing and workload challenges for VHA, which has had ongoing difficulty processing claims from community providers in a timely manner. VHA officials and staff at three of the four claims processing locations we visited told us that limitations of the existing IT systems, including the Fee Basis Claims System (FBCS) that VHA uses for claims processing, have delayed processing and payment of claims for VA care in the community services. Officials at the sites we visited described the following limitations. VHA cannot accept medical documentation electronically. Authorizations for VA care in the community services are not always readily available in FBCS. FBCS cannot automatically adjudicate claims. System weaknesses have delayed claims payments. The officials we interviewed said that if the agency is to dramatically improve its claims processing timeliness, comprehensive and technologically advanced solutions must be developed and implemented, such as modernizing and upgrading VHA’s existing claims processing system or contracting out the claims processing function. In October 2015, VHA submitted a plan to address these issues as part of a broader effort to consolidate VA care in the community programs. The agency estimated that it would take at least 2 years to implement solutions that would fully address all of the challenges now faced by its claims processing staff and by providers of VA care in the community services. However, VHA has not yet provided to Congress or other external stakeholders a plan for modernizing its claims processing system. In particular, VHA has not provided (1) a detailed schedule for developing and implementing each aspect of its new claims processing system; (2) the estimated costs for developing and implementing each aspect of the system; and (3) performance goals, measures, and interim milestones that VHA will use to evaluate progress, hold staff accountable for achieving desired results, and report to stakeholders the agency’s progress in modernizing its claims processing system. That VHA has not yet provided a detailed plan but has stated that it expects to deploy a modernized claims processing system as early as fiscal year 2018 is cause for concern. Thus, to help provide reasonable assurance that VHA achieves its long-term goal of modernizing its claims processing system, we recommended in May 2016 that the Secretary of Veterans Affairs direct the Under Secretary for Health to ensure that the agency develops a sound written plan that includes: a detailed schedule for when VHA intends to complete development and implementation of each major aspect of its new claims processing system; the estimated costs for implementing each major aspect of the system; and the performance goals, measures, and interim milestones that VHA will use to evaluate progress, hold staff accountable for achieving desired results, and report to stakeholders the agency’s progress in modernizing its claims processing system. The department concurred with our recommendation and said that VHA plans to address the recommendation when the agency develops an implementation strategy for the future consolidation of its VA care in the community programs. In conclusion, effective IT management is critical to the performance of VA’s mission. The department faces challenges in key areas, including the development of new systems, modernization of existing systems, and increasing interoperability with DOD. While we recognize that the transformation of VA’s IT organization is intended, among other things, to mitigate the IT weaknesses we have identified, sustained management attention and organizational commitment will be essential to ensuring that the transformation is successful and that the weaknesses are fully addressed.

Over the past several years, the department has expended billions of dollars to manage and modernize its information systems. However, VA has experienced challenges in managing its IT, raising questions about the effectiveness of its IT operations. GAO has previously reported on a number of the department's IT initiatives. This statement summarizes results from key GAO reports issued between 2010 and 2014 highlighting IT challenges that have contributed to GAO's designation of VA health care as a high risk area. It also describes additional challenges that GAO more recently identified in 2015 and 2016 that are related to increasing the electronic exchange of VA's health records with those of DOD, development and use of VBMS, and the department's modernization of its health care claims processing system. In February 2015, GAO designated Veterans Affairs (VA) health care as a high-risk area based on its concerns about the department's ability to ensure the quality and safety of veterans' health care in five broad areas, one of which was information technology (IT) challenges. Of particular concern at that time was the failed modernization of an outpatient appointment scheduling system, suspended development of a system that was to electronically store and retrieve information about surgical implants, and the extent of system interoperability—the ability to exchange information—with the Department of Defense (DOD), which present risks to the timeliness, quality, and safety of VA health care. Subsequent to the designation of VA health care as high risk, GAO completed evaluations that identified additional IT management challenges at VA. In August 2015, GAO reported on VA's efforts to achieve electronic health record interoperability with DOD and noted that (1) the two departments had engaged in several near-term efforts to expand interoperability and (2) VA and DOD had moved forward with plans to separately modernize their electronic health record systems. However, of significant concern was that VA (and DOD) had not identified outcome-oriented goals and metrics that would clearly define what it aims to achieve from its efforts. GAO recommended that VA develop goals and metrics, among other things. VA concurred with the recommendations and stated that it has initiated actions in response. VA had made progress in developing and implementing its Veterans Benefits Management System (VBMS), with deployment of the initial version of the system. However, in September 2015, GAO reported that the development and implementation of the system was ongoing and noted three areas that could benefit from increased management attention: cost estimating, system availability, and system defects. The report also noted that VA had neither conducted a customer satisfaction survey nor developed goals for improving the system. GAO recommended that VA develop a plan with a time frame and a reliable cost estimate for completing VBMS, establish goals for system response time, minimize the incidences of high and medium severity system defects for future VBMS releases, assess user satisfaction, and establish satisfaction goals to promote improvement. VA agreed with the recommendations and noted steps it was taking to address them. Due to recent increases in utilization of VA care in the community, the department has had difficulty processing claims in a timely manner. In May 2016, GAO reported that VA officials and claims processing staff indicated that IT limitations, manual processes, and staffing challenges had delayed claims processing. The department had implemented interim measures to address some of the system's challenges, but did not expect to deploy solutions to address all challenges, including those related to IT, until fiscal year 2018 or later. Further, VA did not have a sound plan for modernizing its claims processing system, which GAO recommended it develop. The department concurred with this recommendation and stated that it intended to address the recommendation through the planned consolidation of its care in the community programs. GAO has made numerous recommendations to VA to improve the modernization of its IT systems. Among other things, GAO has recommended that VA address challenges associated with its efforts to modernize its electronic health record system to increase interoperability with DOD, develop goals and metrics as a basis for determining the extent to which VA's and DOD's modernized electronic health records systems are achieving interoperability, address shortcomings with VBMS planning and implementation, and develop a sound written plan for deploying its modernized claims processing system. VA has concurred with these recommendations and has some actions ongoing.",govreport
"According to GSA, its Federal Technology Service, in conjunction with the IMC, is responsible for ensuring that federal agencies have access to the telecommunications services and solutions needed to meet mission requirements. Its current program to provide long- distance telecommunications services—FTS2001—has two goals: to ensure the best service and price for the government, and to maximize competition for services. In implementing this program strategy, GSA awarded two contracts for long-distance services—one to Sprint in December 1998 and one to MCI WorldCom in January 1999. Under the terms of these contracts, each firm was guaranteed minimum revenues of $750 million over the life of the contracts, which run for four base years and have four 1-year-extension options. If all contract options are exercised, those contracts will expire in December 2006 and January 2007, respectively. According to GSA, federal agencies spent approximately $614 million on FTS2001 services during fiscal year 2003 alone. Related governmentwide telecommunications services are provided by other GSA contracts: the Federal Wireless Telecommunications Service contract and the FTS Satellite Service contracts. The wireless contract was awarded in 1996 to provide wireless telecommunications products and services to all federal agencies, authorized federal contractors, and other users. The satellite services contracts are a series of contracts for a variety of commercial off-the-shelf satellite communications products and services, including mobile, fixed, and broadcast services. According to GSA, these contracts will expire in late 2004 and in 2007, respectively. We have periodically reviewed the development and implementation of the FTS2001 program and assessed its progress. In March 2001 we reported to you on the delays encountered during the government’s efforts to transition from the previous FTS 2000 to the FTS2001 contracts, the reasons for those delays, and the effects of the delays on meeting FTS2001 program goals of maximizing competition for services and ensuring best service and price. We recommended that GSA take numerous actions to facilitate those transition efforts. In April 2001 in testimony before you, we reiterated those recommendations and noted that the process of planning and managing future telecommunications service acquisition would benefit from an accurate and robust inventory of existing telecommunications services. Ultimately, GSA acted on our recommendations and the transitions were successfully completed. GSA is now planning its FTS Networx acquisition program, including the awarding of new governmentwide contracts for a broad range of long distance and international voice and data communications services, wireless services, and satellite telecommunications services. These contracts are intended to replace the existing FTS2001, Federal Wireless Telecommunications Service, and FTS Satellite Service contracts. GSA and the IMC has identified five goals for the Networx acquisition program: Meet agency needs for a comprehensive acquisition that provides continuity of current telecommunications services and solutions. Obtain best value (lowest prices while maintaining quality of service levels) for all services and solutions. Encourage strong competition for the initial contract award(s), and ensure continuous competition throughout the life of the program. Respond to the changing marketplace by providing agency access to a broad range of services and service providers. Provide expanded opportunities for small businesses. To achieve those goals, the program calls for two acquisitions—Networx Universal and Networx Select. The Networx Universal contracts are expected to satisfy requirements for a full range of national and international network services. According to GSA, Networx Universal seeks to ensure the continuity of services and prices found under expiring contracts that provide broad-ranging service with global geographic coverage. GSA expects all Networx Universal offerors to provide a full range of voice and data network services, managed networking services and solutions, and network access, wireless, and satellite communications services. This acquisition is expected to result in multiple contract awards to relatively few offerors because few are expected to be able to satisfy the geographic coverage and comprehensive service requirements. GSA also intends to apply competitive incentives to obtain best value for its customer agencies, although those incentives are not yet defined. Further, GSA expects to establish minimum revenue guarantees for these contracts. In contrast, GSA plans to award multiple contracts for a more geographically limited set of services under Network Select. GSA generally describes these Select contracts as providing agencies with leading edge services and solutions with less extensive geographic and service coverage than that required by Networx Universal; specific Networx Select service requirements have not yet, however, been defined. Details of pricing structures and Select service delivery mechanisms are planned to be provided in the Networx Select request for proposals, which GSA intends to release in the summer of 2005. GSA anticipates awarding both the Networx Universal and the Networx Select contracts well before the expiration of the FTS2001 contracts. Notwithstanding the acquisition planning activities completed by GSA and the IMC to date, these entities face significant challenges in finalizing their program strategy to ensure that Networx is appropriately defined, structured, and managed to deliver those telecommunications services and solutions that will enable federal agencies to most efficiently and effectively meet their mission needs. Specifically, these challenges include: Ensuring that adequate inventory information is available to planners to provide an informed understanding of governmentwide requirements. Establishing measures of success to aid acquisition decision-making and enable effective program management. Structuring and scheduling the Networx contracts to ensure that federal agencies have available to them the competitively priced telecommunications services they need to support their mission objectives. Initiating the implementation planning actions needed to ensure a smooth transition from current contracts to Networx. It is important that GSA and its customer agencies have a clear understanding of agency service requirements in order to make properly informed acquisition planning decisions. According to our ongoing research on best practices in telecommunications acquisition and management, clear understanding comes at least in part from having an accurate baseline inventory of existing services and assets. More specifically, an inventory allows planners to make informed judgments based on an accurate analysis of current requirements and capabilities, emerging needs that must be considered, and the current cost of services. Although leading organizations acknowledge that establishing and maintaining such an inventory may be difficult, they view this baseline as an essential first step to high-quality telecommunications requirements analysis, and subsequent sourcing decisions associated with meeting those requirements. Despite this importance, it is not clear whether GSA and federal agencies have yet established the comprehensive, accurate inventories needed to support Networx planning. Mr. Chairman, you followed up on this issue in your December 17, 2003, letter to GSA asking to what extent such detailed inventories were currently being maintained and kept accurate and up-to- date for use both in acquisition planning and future contract transitions. In his response, the Administrator of General Services identified sources of information provided by GSA and the FTS2001 vendors—for example, monthly billing information—that would be helpful to agencies in developing inventories of existing services. In addition, the Administrator noted that GSA is examining methods of incorporating better billing and inventory data into the Networx program where practical. However, the Administrator did not provide specific information on the extent to which these inventories exist, or whether agencies are periodically validating that information to ensure that it is accurate and complete. Further, the Administrator acknowledged that the accuracy and completeness of telecommunications service inventories varies among agencies. As a result, without a clear understanding by GSA and its customer agencies of the FTS2001 services used today and the applications they support, it is unclear how properly informed Networx acquisition planning decisions can be made. Our research into recommended program and project measurement practices, which we affirmed in discussions with private-sector telecommunications managers, highlights the importance of establishing clear measures of success to aid acquisition decision making as well as to provide the foundation for accountable program management. Such measures define what must be done for a project to be acceptable to the stakeholders and users affected by it, and in so doing enables measurement of progress and effectiveness in meeting objectives. Although GSA has established program goals, it has not yet defined a comprehensive set of corresponding performance measures for the Networx acquisition program. According to GSA’s Assistant Commissioner for Service Delivery/Development, one of the criteria for measuring Networx success will be identical to that used for FTS2001—that is, savings as measured by contract service costs compared with best commercial pricing. Further, according to this official, this was the sole measure reported to the Office of Management and Budget for FTS2001. While low pricing is an important criterion reflected in program goals, GSA has not yet defined measures about how well its final acquisition plan will deliver the value (service plus price) that agencies need to improve their operations and meet their mission needs. For example, GSA’s Networx environmental assessment indicates that agencies want this program to support network planning and optimization, include simple and understandable fees, provide management of contracts and contractors on the agencies’ behalf, and include other elements of value. GSA’s Assistant Commissioner for Service Delivery/Development recognizes the importance of having such measures, and told us that GSA would be establishing such measures coincident with its actions to finalize the Networx Universal RFP in the coming months. It will be important that GSA follow through on this commitment to establish that appropriate set of measures to evaluate the intended business value of the Networx program and enable the effective management of this significant program over time. Once agency requirements are adequately understood and measures of success defined, structuring and scheduling the Networx contracts to successfully encourage industry competition to obtain low prices and high-quality, innovative services becomes the next challenge. The varying views of industry representatives commenting on the request for information raised fundamental questions about the soundness of the proposed acquisition approach for accomplishing this. For example, large, interexchange carriers, like those that hold the current FTS2001 contracts, generally agreed with the broad scope of the Universal contracts. They further suggested that services offered under Networx Select and Universal should be mutually exclusive, and that all carriers should be allowed to compete for both. In contrast, other carriers criticized the approach. These carriers asserted that some major telecommunications providers might be precluded from bidding on the Networx Universal contracts because of the broad service and ubiquitous geographic coverage requirements described in the request for information. For example, one vendor stated that it was quite possible that only traditional long distance carriers could effectively bid for Universal, thus denying many players in the industry a realistic chance to compete for major portions of the federal long distance business. One carrier noted that, based on the procurement timetable, the timing of the award for the Select contracts would minimize the opportunity to compete for long-distance telecommunications services. Because of the 9-month lag between the Universal and Select acquisitions indicated in the proposed acquisition schedule, agencies could be asked to make decisions regarding their use of awarded Universal service contracts before information is available regarding Select leading edge services and solutions that may be more suitable for their needs. Defining an acquisition strategy that appropriately balances the need to ensure the continuation of existing telecommunications services in all current government locations with encouraging strong competition to obtain best value is a daunting challenge. However, proceeding from a clear understanding of requirements and measures of success—as I previously discussed—should aid in meeting this challenge by providing guideposts for a decision that strikes an appropriate balance on contract scope, program structure, and acquisition schedules that can deliver to agencies competitively priced solutions that meet their mission needs. Further, continuing to solicit and effectively implement feedback from stakeholders should help GSA achieve this goal. As we reported to you in March 2001, the current FTS2001 contracts got off to a rocky start as significant delays in transitioning to the new contracts hindered timely achievement of program goals. Factors contributing to those delays included a lack of data needed to accurately measure and effectively manage the transitions, inadequate resources, and other process and procedural issues. Ultimately, GSA did take action on all of our recommendations and the transition to the FTS2001 contracts was finally completed. In subsequent testimony before you in April 2001 we noted the importance of incorporating the lessons learned from this transition into future procurements. Specifically, we stated that “the process of planning and managing future telecommunications service acquisitions—both by GSA and by the agencies themselves—will benefit from an accurate and robust inventory of current telecommunications services. Further, the value of this critical program to customer agencies will be improved through the application of lessons learned in streamlining and prioritizing the contract modification process, in effectively and expeditiously resolving billing problems, and in holding contractors accountable for meeting agency requirements in a timely manner.” Those in industry who commented on the Networx request for information also noted the need for strong and comprehensive program management to ensure successful transition, including not only the availability of accurate inventories but also defined contractor and government responsibilities. While GSA recognizes the importance of transition planning, it has not yet fully addressed these issues. GSA has emphasized that its development of the Networx program included an analysis of lessons learned from existing programs and previous acquisitions. Further, in his February 11 letter in response to your inquiry about agency inventories, the Administrator outlined the proactive steps GSA plans to take, including actions to establish a working group and to improve the availability of accurate inventory information to support the transition. According to the GSA’s Associate Commissioner Service Delivery/Development, these actions will also include developing processes and procedures, identifying funding needs, and training agency personnel in order to support a smooth contract transition. As acquisition plans are finalized in the coming months, it will be important that GSA follow through on these initial steps to ensure that the transition to the new contracts proceeds efficiently and seamlessly, and that a repeat of the FTS2001 transition difficulties is avoided. In summary, Mr. Chairman, Networx represents a critical opportunity to leverage the strength and creativity of the telecommunications marketplace to make the vision of delivering to agencies the telecommunications business solutions they need to perform their missions better and more cost-effectively a reality, and in so doing to carry the federal government forward well into the 21st century. To accomplish this, however, GSA will need to overcome significant challenges and demonstrate solid leadership. Likewise critical will be stakeholder commitment. Actions taken and decisions reached in the coming months to more fully define the Networx program and finalize an appropriate acquisition strategy will significantly influence the telecommunications choices federal agencies will have for the next several years. Unless GSA follows through to resolve the challenges outlined today, the potential of Networx may well not be realized. Mr. Chairman, this concludes my statement. I would be pleased to answer any questions that you or other members of the Committee may have at this time. Should you have any questions about this testimony, please contact me by e-mail at koontzl@gao.gov or Kevin Conway, Assistant Director, at conwayk@gao.gov. We can also be reached at (202) 512-6240 and (202) 512-6340, respectively. Another major contributor to this testimony was Michael P. Fruitman.

It will also replace contracts for wireless and satellite communications products and services. Planning for this acquisition is occurring within an environment of tremendous change--in the industry, in underlying services and technology, and potentially in the regulatory environment. In this context, Networx can offer a significant opportunity for the federal government to flexibly acquire telecommunications services at competitive rates and apply innovative solutions to improving agency operations. At the request of the Chairman of the House Committee on Government Reform, GAO is providing an overview of acquisition planning steps completed to date, along with its assessment of challenges facing GSA and federal agencies as this acquisition proceeds. Over the past year, GSA has acted to ensure that all interested parties-- including industry and agency users--have had a chance to comment on the development of the successor to FTS2001 and associated contracts. In its planning for the Networx acquisition, GSA cited five goals for the program: (1) continuity of telecommunications services, (2) best value, (3) strong competition, (4) a broad range of services and providers in a changing marketplace, and (5) expanded opportunities for small businesses. To achieve this, GSA plans two acquisitions: Networx Universal--broadranging services with global coverage, and Networx Select--leading-edge services but more geographically limited. To take full advantage of the opportunities offered in these new contracts, GSA will need to address four key challenges: (1) ensuring that an adequate inventory of information about existing telecommunications services and assets is available, to give planners an informed understanding of governmentwide requirements; (2) establishing specific measures of success to aid acquisition decision making and effective program management; (3) structuring and scheduling the contracts to ensure timely delivery of competitively priced telecommunications services that meet agency mission needs; and (4) ensuring a smooth transition from the current contracts by initiating appropriate implementation planning actions. Both leadership from GSA and commitment from stakeholders in resolving these issues will be essential to establishing efficient, cost-effective, and secure telecommunications services. If this can be achieved, the Networx contracts will be optimally positioned to leverage the power and creativity of today's telecommunications marketplace to carry the federal government forward well into the 21st century.",govreport
"DOD may be unable to prevent an attack using chemical or biological weapons. Therefore, DOD has determined that servicemembers must be protected to survive and conduct effective military operations. Consequently, DOD supplies servicemembers with a protective ensemble consisting of a suit, mask with breathing filter, rubber boots, butyl gloves, and hoods as required. Figure 1 displays the components that comprise a protective ensemble. During Operation Desert Shield/Desert Storm, DOD noted that most of this equipment (1) could cause unacceptable heat stress to the wearer, (2) could limit freedom of movement and impair job performance, (3) is bulky, and (4) is not fully interoperable across the services. Furthermore, most of the existing suits (1) are no longer manufactured, (2) can be used for up to 14 years from the date of manufacture, and (3) will expire by 2007. To address these issues, DOD developed new, lightweight individual protective equipment such as the Joint Service Lightweight Integrated Suit Technology (JSLIST) trousers and coat to replace the current protective suits. DOD began procuring the JSLIST suits in 1997. An improved multipurpose overboot is in procurement and new protective gloves are under development to improve manual dexterity and/or reduce heat stress on the wearer. Similarly, since the existing masks may cause some breathing difficulty, DOD is developing a new mask but does not expect to begin procurement until fiscal year 2006. During fiscal years 2002 through 2007, DOD plans to spend about $5.7 billion on planning for chemical and biological defense, acquisition of defense equipment, facilities construction, and research and development. In 1999, we recommended that DOD develop a performance plan guided by outcome-oriented management principles embodied in the Government Performance and Results Act of 1993 (Pub. L. 103-62). DOD created a plan; however, performance goals and measures were being developed at the time of our review. DOD’s assessment process for determining the risk to military operations is unreliable, and, as a result, the Department’s current determination that the risk is generally low is inaccurate. Although the Department uses the Chemical and Biological Defense Program Annual Report to Congress to indicate its readiness for operations in a chemically and biologically contaminated environment, the 2000 report contains erroneous inventory data and understates equipment requirements. More important, the methodology for assessing the risk is flawed because it is not based on the number of complete ensembles needed and it obscures military service readiness by combining service data and reporting the results jointly. DOD’s criteria for assessing the risk of wartime shortages is to determine the numbers of protective suits, masks, breathing filters, gloves, boots, and hoods it has on hand, compare them against the requirements for those individual items, and then assign risk. (See table 1) In the draft fiscal year 2001 annual report to Congress provided to us in June 2001, DOD reported that it was generally at low risk for suits.However, the risk assessment process was flawed in part because DOD used erroneous data on protective suits. For example DOD made computational errors in comparing the older suits and JSLIST suits against a combined total suit requirement, the Air Force overreported its suit requirement by 801,167 suits, DOD reported it had 1,229,935 JSLIST suits on hand as of September 30, 2000, but overcounted its inventory by 782,232 JSLIST suits, the Navy included about 117,000 suits that had passed their expiration dates and were therefore unusable, and the Army underreported its suit stocks by an estimated 231,050 suits. These errors occurred in large part as the result of problems in DOD’s systems for managing protective suit inventories. We believe that the services collectively had no more than 4,348,999 suits of all types on hand as of September 30, 2000. When we included all the suits for wartime use and adjusted the numbers to account for the errors and miscounts, the risk category changed to high for suits, as shown in table 2. In February 2001, the military services informed the Joint Nuclear, Biological, and Chemical Defense Board that equipment requirements were actually much higher than those reported to Congress and included in the fiscal year 2001 Logistics Support Plan. The board subsequently accepted the new requirements. Based on these new requirements, the risk remained high for suits; changed to high for filters, boots, and hoods; and remained low for gloves and masks, as shown by comparing the risk level columns in tables 2 and 3. DOD has inaccurately assessed the risk to military operations by determining the number of individual items of equipment it has on hand and by combining the services’ inventories of individual items. Service guidance specifies that a total of 1,573,866 active and reserve servicemembers need protection to meet current operations plan requirements. DOD provides each deploying servicemember with up to four ensembles either at deployment or held in war reserve and distributed to theater operating forces when needed. The ensembles consist of five components: (1) four protective suits, (2) between four and eight pairs of gloves and boots, (3) between four and eight hoods, (4) up to four breathing filters, and (5) one mask. Because DOD does not report each service’s readiness based on the equipment it has on hand, but rather provides a joint assessment, critical service shortages or opportunities for cross-service assistance tend to be obscured. In fact, each service reported shortages of one component of the ensemble. Specifically, the Army reported critical shortages of hoods; the Air Force reported shortages of gloves; the Navy, shortages of suits; the Marine Corps, shortages of boots. When we compared the number of ensembles required by each service’s guidance and applied the DOD risk criteria, the risk was high for all four services. As a result, DOD cannot provide all the required ensembles for 682,331 servicemembers scheduled for wartime deployment, as shown in table 4. The risk posed by suit shortages is likely to worsen through 2007 due to increasing rates of older suits’ expiration and DOD’s plan not to replace all of them. As of October 1, 2000, DOD reported a shortage of about 1.7 million protective suits; it believes about 3.3 million, or 75 percent, of the current suit inventory will expire by 2006. JSLIST suits cost about $203 each compared to about $80 each for most of the existing suits, and DOD plans to buy only about 2.8 million JSLIST suits as replacements. Therefore, the shortage will increase to about 2.2 million suits by 2006. DOD’s plan to buy fewer new suits is also influenced by expiration of the suits and budgetary considerations. By replacing suits at a rate slower than the expiration rate, DOD plans to spread future suit purchases over more years to avoid a disproportionately large amount of suits expiring in any one year. This tactic allows greater dispersion of future suit expirations and replacement costs but is likely to also increase the short-term risk of wartime shortages. DOD is attempting to mitigate some of the shortages. For example, the Army plans to procure more than 500,000 hoods through fiscal year 2002, and the Defense Logistics Agency was procuring more of the existing generation of boots at the time of our report. Some opportunities also exist for one service to assist another. For example, the Army and Marine Corps reported significantly more gloves on hand than required and could transfer some to the Air Force to offset Air Force shortfalls since all the services use the same gloves. However, other available equipment is not interoperable and cannot be easily shared. For example, the Navy and Marine Corps suits are hooded, so they do not have separate hoods and therefore cannot help alleviate the Army’s shortage. If all goes according to plan, such interoperability problems should ease after fiscal year 2006, as all four services begin using the JSLIST suit and new joint masks, gloves, and boots. Shortcomings in DOD’s inventory management of chemical and biological protective equipment adversely affect the Department’s ability to accurately assess the readiness of the services to meet requirements for the equipment and mitigate the risk of shortages. DOD’s current inventory information on chemical and biological equipment is unreliable for making an accurate risk assessment because DOD and the services cannot easily link inventory records; lack data on suit expiration dates; cannot easily identify, track, and locate defective suits; and have miscalculated the requirements and the number of suits available. These shortcomings are consistent with long-term problems in DOD’s inventory management that we have consistently identified since 1990 as a high-risk area due to a variety of problems, including ineffective and wasteful management systems and procedures. The Defense Logistics Agency and the military services store war reserve inventories of chemical and biological protective suits and other equipment at a variety of depots, warehouses, and storage facilities and as noted earlier, use at least nine different inventory systems to manage the inventories. However, because these systems are not linked, DOD-wide oversight of the inventories is restricted, and the systems are not used to directly support the inventory data in the annual report to Congress and the Logistics Support Plan. Instead, DOD makes an additional effort to collect data theoretically already in the systems. The data collection requires units and depots that store the chemical protective equipment to provide separate data on the equipment annually and relies heavily on government and contractor personnel to manually compile the data. Although DOD has at least nine major inventory management systems, it cannot accurately determine the expiration rate of most of the older suits used by the Air Force and Army. These account for about 3.3 million of the current suit inventory and can be used for up to 14 years from the date of manufacture after which testing has determined that the suits cannot be used in a contaminated environment. Therefore, knowing the date the suits were manufactured is critical to estimating the suits’ expiration rate and the rate at which the suits must be replaced with JSLIST suits. However, neither DOD nor we can accurately determine the expiration rate of the old suits because the Defense Logistics Agency, the buyer of the suits, was unable to locate most of the relevant procurement records. Moreover, many of the inventory systems cannot be used to locate the actual expired suits in specific depots because the systems do not record equipment expiration dates or the manufacturers’ contract or lot numbers. Two examples or illustrations follow: The Army does not record suit expiration information in its primary inventory management system. To compensate, the Army has assumed an annual 20-percent expiration rate of its inventory through fiscal year 2005 and expects that all suits will expire by 2005. However, the Army’s assumption may be inaccurate. Records from a depot in Kentucky indicate that almost 80,000 suits would be serviceable after 2005 and some as late as 2008. The Navy does not know when its suits will expire because, according to the Naval Sea Systems Command, the Navy does not require inventory managers to include the expiration date in inventory records. Nonetheless, in June 2001, the Navy estimated that of 178,000 suits that it had on hand, only about 61,000 were actually serviceable because the rest had passed their expiration date. Our review of 19 Military Sealift Command ships, which help to sustain deployed U.S. forces, showed that most had severe suit shortages, due mostly to expirations. We found additional problems in 48 ships in the Atlantic and Pacific fleets. These ships currently report that they are missing one or more components of their ensembles and consequently cannot provide a complete ensemble for a single crewmember. The Air Force and Marine Corps use different inventory management systems that include contract, lot, and expiration information. Consequently, these two services can estimate suit expiration rates to manage their inventories effectively. Nonetheless, neither system is compatible with the other DOD systems. The majority of DOD’s and the services’ inventory systems cannot be used to identify, track, and locate defective suits that may be in current inventories because contract and lot numbers needed for the purpose are not always included in the inventory records. In September 1999, officials from one manufacturer pleaded guilty to selling 778,924 defective suits to the government. Since these defective suits were distributed to DOD war reserve and various other inventories, it was imperative that the suits be found. In May 2000, DOD directed units and depots to locate the defective suits and issue them for training use only. At the conclusion of our review, DOD had not found about 250,000 of these suits and did not know whether they had been used, were still in supply, or were sent for disposal. Finding the suits was difficult even when the storage depot was known. For example, the Defense Logistics Agency inventory system does not link the contract and lot number with the box or pallet number to allow ease in locating specific items. Consequently, during our review, the Agency resorted to using 19 reservists for up to 34 days to physically inspect all pallets and boxes containing about 1.3 million protective suits at its depot in Albany, GA. The reservists found about 347,000 defective suits. Figure 2 displays some of the boxes of these suits. Despite the problem in finding defective suits, the Defense Logistics Agency’s supply system remained unchanged at the time of our review. Agency officials acknowledged that they would have to physically reinspect depot stocks if specific lots of other suits need to be removed from the inventory before the end of their normal 14-year shelf life. Several questionable inventory management practices and related actions have further contributed to the generation of the inaccurate inventory data, which in turn affects the accuracy of DOD’s risk assessment process. These include miscalculating suit requirements, failing to count parts of the suit inventory, and counting suits as part of the inventory long before they are actually delivered from manufacturers. Some specifics regarding these counts are as follows: The Air Force double-counted a portion of its suit requirement by reporting a requirement for both 801,167 of the older suits and the same number of replacement JSLIST suits. The Army asked units that store suits to report the numbers being stored, but it did not tell them to include desert pattern suits, which are generally reserved for use in desert climates. As a result, units did not always include desert pattern suits in their reported inventories, and the Army believes it consequently underreported its desert pattern suit inventory by 10 percent of the total, or 231,050 suits. In the fiscal year 2001 Logistics Support Plan and draft Annual Report to Congress, the services reported they had 1,229,935 JSLIST suits on hand on September 30, 2000, but that included 782,232 suits not yet delivered. DOD procedures for compiling inventory data for these reports allow reporting suits expected to be delivered during the year as on hand. In March 2001, the Marine Corps Systems Command, which manages JSLIST suit distribution, acknowledged that DOD did not have 1,229,935 JSLIST suits on hand on September 30, 2000 but might reach that quantity a year later on September 30, 2001. Moreover, in the same two reports, DOD projected that it would reach 1.5 million suits by September 30, 2001, again overestimating JSLIST production. DOD’s inventory management practices tend to affect the suit inventory count. This count in turn can significantly affect the results of the risk assessment process, which is a comparison of requirements against the inventory on hand. Because the Department of Defense’s risk assessment process is flawed and unreliable, DOD inaccurately assessed the risk to servicemembers’ lives and military operations from potential wartime shortages of protective equipment as low. The Department underestimated the risk by analyzing requirements based on individual equipment items and not ensembles. Furthermore, DOD combined this service data into a consolidated DOD inventory position, which obscured service-specific shortages. As we discovered, the risk is currently higher than reported by DOD. Inadequate inventory management has contributed to increased risk. Because the Department has no integrated inventory system for managing protective equipment, it has no effective way to (1) gather the data needed for the annual report to Congress and Logistics Support plan, (2) determine the expiration dates of protective equipment, and (3) ensure that its data is correct. To further compound the problem, the services have counted equipment as on hand before it has been delivered, adding to the overcounting of equipment that they had in the inventory. Inaccurate risk assessment and inadequate inventory management could adversely affect readiness and prevent informed acquisition decisions that could undermine risk mitigation. To improve the Department of Defense’s ability to accurately assess the level of risk and readiness for operations in a contaminated environment, we recommend that the Secretary of Defense direct the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics to issue and implement guidance requiring each service to evaluate its risk on the basis of current inventory numbers of complete ensembles against wartime requirements; implement a fully integrated inventory management system to manage chemical and biological defense equipment and use it to prepare (1) the required annual report to Congress and (2) the annual Logistics Support Plan on chemical and biological defense; establish data fields in the inventory management system to show the contract, lot number, and expiration date of shelf life items; and cease counting equipment as on hand before delivery from the contractor. DOD provided written comments on a draft of our report and generally concurred with our recommendations. DOD partially concurred with our recommendation to conduct risk assessments on the basis of ensembles required in wartime and not just components of the ensemble and stated that the department will issue implementing guidance. DOD concurred with comment with our recommendations to (1) establish an integrated inventory management system; (2) include item contract, lot number, and expiration date information in the new inventory system; and (3) cease counting equipment as on hand before it is delivered and explained its plan to implement the recommendations. In addition, DOD provided technical comments, which we incorporated into our report as appropriate. DOD’s comments are printed in their entirety in appendix II along with our evaluation of their comments. We discuss our scope and methodology in detail in appendix I. We conducted our review from August 2000 to April 2001 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. We will send copies of this report to interested congressional committees; the Secretaries of Defense, the Army, the Navy, and the Air Force; the Commandant of the Marine Corps; and the Director of the Office of Management and Budget. If you or your staff have any questions about this report, please contact me at (202) 512-6020. Additional contact and staff acknowledgments are listed in appendix III. We determined (1) whether DOD’s process for assessing the risk to military operations on the basis of wartime equipment requirements is reliable and (2) how DOD’s inventory management of chemical and biological protective gear has affected the risk level. We included in our scope chemical and biological protective suits, masks and breathing filters, gloves, boots, and hoods. To understand the process DOD uses to assess the risk, we determined how DOD performs risk assessments. We examined DOD’s fiscal years 1999, 2000, and 2001 Chemical and Biological Defense: Annual Report to Congress and Joint Service Nuclear, Biological, and Chemical Defense Logistics Support Plan: Readiness and Sustainment Status and service input to these reports. To understand equipment requirements, we interviewed an official from the Office of the Deputy Assistant to the Secretary of Defense, Chemical and Biological Defense; the Joint Nuclear, Biological, and Chemical Defense Board; the Joint Staff; and other organizations and obtained documents showing how many suits, masks, breathing filters, gloves, boots, and hoods are needed to support operations. We also obtained the Center for Army Analysis’ Joint Service Chemical Defense Equipment Consumption Rates IV, Volume II; briefing slides; guidance; directives; memorandums; cables; and other documents that specify requirements. We also used service guidance to determine the number of servicemembers scheduled for deployment who need protection. We did not evaluate the validity of the requirements. To calculate on-hand stocks, we obtained inventory records from war reserve or other depots in the United States, Japan, the Republic of Korea, the Netherlands, elsewhere in Europe, and aboard prepositioned ships in Guam to determine the size of the stockpile. As a result of the national security reviews under way at the time of our review, requirements for chemical defense equipment could change. If so, current risk assessments would need revision. To determine how DOD’s inventory management practices affected risk, we tried to verify the accuracy of inventory data reported by the services. We did this by (1) interviewing officials and obtaining documents showing how the inventory data were collected and verified, (2) obtaining Navy documents showing the number of suits still in the inventory that had not expired and comparing that number to the reported inventory, and (3) obtaining JSLIST suit production data. We also tried to determine how many of the older chemical protective suits DOD had bought and when, but the Defense Logistics Agency could not find most of its records documenting suit procurement. To determine the compatibility of the nine major supply systems, we interviewed the responsible DOD officials, compared system inventory procedures, checked records against physical inventories, and obtained relevant documents. To determine how long shelf life items can be used and to estimate equipment expiration rates, we interviewed officials from the Army’s Soldier Biological and Chemical Command in Maryland; Natick Soldier Center in Massachusetts; and Rock Island Arsenal in Illinois; the Naval Sea Systems Command in Virginia; the Air Force Headquarters Directorate of Supply in Washington, D.C.; and the Marine Corps’ Combat Development Command in Virginia and Materiel Command in Georgia. We also interviewed officials and obtained documents from the Defense Logistics Agency offices in Pennsylvania showing planned or actual procurement of JSLIST suits and other equipment. To determine how the services and depots identify which items will expire and need replacement, we inspected or inventoried chemical protective suits stored at the Bluegrass Army Depot in Richmond, KY; the Defense Logistics Agency’s war reserve depot in Albany, GA; the Air Force’s Mobility Bag Center in Avon Park and MacDill Air Force Base, FL; and aboard ships at the Norfolk Navy Base, Norfolk, VA. At these locations, we met with officials and obtained supply records and suit and other equipment expiration data. The following is our response to the Department of Defense letter dated September 18, 2001. 1. While DOD presents the data in the cited Annual Report to Congress and Logistics Support Plan annexes, the data is presented on an item-by- item basis and not an ensemble basis. Consequently, the information as presented does not give a fully reliable risk assessment. DOD acknowledges that it has scarce resources and must manage risk within those resource constraints. Consequently, DOD also indicated in its comments that it will rely on industrial surge capacity to make up any shortfall in required ensemble components. Nonetheless, the Department’s risk assessment is based on having 120 days of supply at the units or in war reserve. If the Department now plans to stock fewer than 120 days of supply and rely on industrial surge to make up the difference in a crisis, the risk level would be higher because the continuing shortages would be greater. 2. The Air Force has developed, and the Marine Corps is developing inventory systems, both of which include contract, lot number, and expiration date of equipment on hand. Adopting one of these systems DOD-wide could reduce or eliminate development costs associated with the Business System Modernization program, assure interoperability across the services, and meet the intent of our third recommendation.

To reduce the effects of such an attack on military personnel, DOD has determined the quantity of chemical and biological protective suits, masks, breathing filters, gloves, boots, and hoods that are needed based on projected wartime requirements. DOD's assessment process is unreliable for determining the risk to military operations. DOD's 2000 report is inaccurate because it includes erroneous inventory data and wartime requirements. Inadequate inventory management is an additional risk factor because readiness can be compromised by DOD's inventory management practices, which prevent an accurate accounting of the availability or adequacy of its protective equipment.",govreport
"Under the Rehabilitation Act, a person is considered to have a disability if the individual has a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities. Existing federal efforts are intended to promote the employment of individuals with disabilities in the federal workforce and help agencies carry out their responsibilities under the Rehabilitation Act. For example, federal statutes and regulations provide special hiring authorities for people with disabilities. These include Schedule A excepted service hiring authority—which permits the noncompetitive appointment of qualified individuals with intellectual, severe physical, or psychiatric disabilities without posting and publicizing the position—and appointments and noncompetitive conversion for veterans who are 30 percent or more disabled. To qualify for a Schedule A appointment, an applicant must generally provide proof of disability and a certification of job readiness. Proof of disability can come from a number of sources, including a licensed medical professional, or a state agency that issues or provides disability benefits. The proof of disability document does not need to detail the applicant’s medical history or need for an accommodation. Executive Order 13548 committed the federal government to many of the goals of an executive order issued a decade earlier, but went further by requiring federal agencies to take certain actions. For example, Executive Order 13548 requires federal agencies to develop plans for hiring and retaining employees with disabilities and to designate a senior-level official to be accountable for meeting the goals of the order and to develop and implement the agency’s plan. In addition, OPM and Labor have oversight responsibilities to ensure the successful implementation of the executive order (see table 1). For the purposes of determining agency progress in the employment of people with disabilities and setting targeted goals, the federal government tracks the number of individuals with disabilities in the workforce through OPM’s Standard Form 256, Self-Disclosure of Disability (SF-256). Federal employees voluntarily submit this form to disclose that they have a disability, as defined by the Rehabilitation Act. For reporting purposes, disabilities are separated into two major categories: Targeted and Other Disabilities. Targeted disabilities, generally considered to be more severe, include such conditions as total deafness, complete paralysis, and psychiatric disabilities. Other disabilities include such conditions as partial hearing or vision loss, gastrointestinal disorders, and learning disabilities. Further, Labor is given responsibilities in the executive order to improve efforts to help employees who sustain work-related injuries and illnesses return to work. In July 2010, the Protecting Our Workers and Ensuring Reemployment (POWER) Initiative was established, led by Labor. This initiative aims to improve agency return-to-work outcomes by setting performance targets, collecting and analyzing injury and illness data, and prioritizing safety and health management programs that have proven effective in the past. 5 U.S.C. §8101, et seq. Workers’ Compensation Programs (OWCP) reviews FECA claims and makes decisions on eligibility and payments. We have completed a number of reviews that have identified steps that agencies could take to provide equal employment opportunity to qualified individuals with disabilities in the federal workforce. In July 2010, we held a forum that identified barriers to the federal employment of people with disabilities and leading practices to overcome these barriers. Participants said that the most significant barrier keeping people with disabilities from the workplace is attitudinal and identified eight leading practices that agencies could implement to help the federal government become a model employer: (1) top leadership commitment; (2) accountability, including goals to help guide and sustain efforts; (3) regular surveying of the workforce on disability issues; (4) better coordination within and across agencies; (5) training for staff at all levels to disseminate leading practices (6) career development opportunities inclusive of people with (7) a flexible work environment; and (8) centralized funding at the agency level for reasonable accommodations. GAO, Highlights of a Forum: Participant-Identified Leading Practices that Could Increase the Employment of Individuals with Disabilities in the Federal Workforce, GAO-11-81SP (Washington, D.C.: Oct. 5, 2010). OPM, in consultation with EEOC, OMB, and Labor, issued a memorandum in November 2010 to heads of executive departments and agencies outlining the key requirements of the executive order and what elements must be included in agency disability hiring plans. These elements include listing the name of the senior-level official to be held accountable for meeting the goals of the executive order and describing how the agency will hire individuals with disabilities at all grade levels and in various job occupations. The memorandum also described strategies that agencies could take to become model employers of people with disabilities, such as reviewing all recruitment materials to ensure accessibility for people with disabilities. To help implement the strategies, OPM contracted in December 2010 with a private firm to recruit and to manage a list of Schedule A-certified individuals from which federal agencies can hire. OPM received 66 agency plans for promoting the employment of individuals with disabilities, representing over 99 percent of the federal civilian executive branch workforce. OPM officials reviewed all the plans, recording whether they met criteria developed by OPM based on the executive order and its model strategies memorandum. OPM also identified and informed agencies about innovative ideas included in plans. In reviewing the plans, OPM found that many agency plans did not meet one or more of its review criteria (see fig. 1). For example, OPM’s review found that 29 of the 66 agency plans did not include numerical goals for the hiring of people with disabilities. OPM also found that 9 of the 66 agency plans did not identify a senior-level official responsible for the development and implementation of the plan. Finally, only 7 of the 66 plans met all of the criteria; over half of the plans met 8 or fewer of the 13 criteria. However, OPM expected agencies to begin implementing their plans immediately, regardless of any unaddressed deficiencies. Agencies met some criteria more successfully than others. For example, OPM found that 40 of the 66 agency plans included a process for increasing the use of Schedule A to increase the hiring of people with disabilities. In contrast, 29 of the 66 agency plans provided for the quarterly monitoring of the rate at which employees injured on the job successfully return to work. OPM provided agencies with written feedback on plan deficiencies and strongly encouraged agencies to address them numerous times beginning in June 2011. However, 32 out of the 59 agencies with deficiencies in their plans had not addressed them as of April 2012. Specifically, in June 2011, OPM provided agencies with access to reviews of their plans, which identified deficiencies, through OMB’s Max Information System (MAX). According to OPM, in July 2011, a White House official told agency senior executives that they were required to address deficiencies in their plans. In October and November 2011, OPM provided agencies with a list of the deficiencies identified in their plans, and asked agencies to determine how their plans could be improved. In December 2011, OPM again told agencies they were strongly encouraged to review and address plan deficiencies and provided agencies with several examples of plans that met all of the criteria. Though the executive order does not specifically authorize OPM to require agencies to address plan deficiencies, it calls for OPM to regularly report on agencies’ progress in implementing their plans to the White House and others. In response to the executive order’s reporting requirement, OPM officials told us that they had briefed White House officials on issues related to agencies’ implementation of the executive order, but did not provide information on the deficiencies in all of the agency plans. In addition, OPM does not think that the federal government is on target to achieve the goals set in the executive order. While the executive order did not provide additional detail as to what information should be reported, providing information on the extent to which agencies’ plans have met OPM’s criteria would better enable the White House to hold agencies accountable for addressing plan deficiencies. In addition to reviewing agency plans, the executive order required OPM to develop mandatory training programs on the employment of people with disabilities for both human resources personnel and hiring managers, within 60 days of the executive order date. We have previously reported that training at all staff levels, in particular training on hiring, reasonable accommodations, and diversity awareness, can help disseminate leading practices throughout an agency and communicate expectations for implementation of policies and procedures related to improving employment of people with disabilities. Such policies and procedures could be communicated across the federal government with training on topics such as how to access and efficiently use the list of Schedule A- certified individuals, the availability of internships and fellowships, such as Labor’s Workforce Recruitment Program, and online communities of practice established to help officials share best practices on hiring people with disabilities, such as eFedlink. In its November 2010 model strategies memorandum to heads of executive agencies, OPM stated that, in consultation with Labor, EEOC, and OMB, it was developing the mandatory training programs required by the executive order and that further information would be forthcoming. OPM officials told us in March 2012 that they are working with federal Chief Human Capital Officers (CHCO) to develop modules on topics such as using special hiring authority that will be available through HR University. Officials explained that they need to ensure that the training is uniform to ensure all personnel receive consistent information, and they expect the training modules to be ready by August 2012. Although it has yet to fully develop mandatory training programs, OPM has taken steps to train and inform federal officials about tools available to them. For example, OPM partnered with Labor, EEOC, and other agencies to provide elective training courses for federal officials involved in implementing the executive order on topics including: the executive order, model recruitment strategies, guidance on developing disability hiring plans, and return-to-work strategies. OPM also conducted training on implementation of the executive order in July 2011 specifically for senior executives accountable for their agencies’ plans. It also offers short online videos for hiring managers on topics such as Schedule A hiring authority. Further, other governmentwide training on employing people with disabilities exists. For example, Labor’s Job Accommodation Network offers online training on relevant issues like applying the Americans with Disabilities Amendments Act and providing reasonable accommodations. Moreover, the Department of Defense’s Computer/Electronic Accommodations Program offers online training modules to help federal employees understand the benefits of hiring people with disabilities. Nevertheless, agency officials we interviewed told us that they would like to have more comprehensive training on strategies for hiring and retaining individuals with disabilities, confirming the need for OPM to complete the development of the training programs required by the executive order. For example, officials from one agency said that more training on the relationship between return-to-work efforts and providing reasonable accommodations is needed, while officials from another agency identified a need for increased awareness of the Schedule A hiring process. Executive Order 13548 requires OPM to implement a system for reporting regularly to the president, heads of agencies, and the public on agencies’ progress in implementing the objectives of the executive order. OPM is also to compile, and post on its website, governmentwide statistics on the hiring of individuals with disabilities. This is important because effectively measuring workforce demographics requires reliable data to inform decisions and to allow for individual and agencywide accountability. To measure and assess their progress towards achieving the goals of the executive order, agencies and OPM use data about disability status that employees voluntarily self-report on the SF-256. OPM’s guidance to agencies for implementing the executive order explained that the data gathered from the SF-256 is crucial for agencies to determine whether they are achieving their disability hiring goals. Agencies also report these data to EEOC in an effort to identify and develop strategies to eliminate potential barriers to equal employment opportunities. According to the form, the data are used to develop reports to bring to light agency specific or governmentwide deficiencies in the hiring, placement, and advancement of individuals with disabilities. The information is confidential and cannot be used to affect an employee in any way. Only staff who record the data in an agency’s or OPM’s personnel systems have access to the information. According to draft data from OPM, as stated earlier, the government hired approximately 20,000 employees with disabilities during fiscal years 2010 and 2011. However, according to officials at OPM, EEOC, VA, Education, and SSA, accurately measuring the number of current and newly hired employees with disabilities is an ongoing challenge. While the accuracy of the SF- 256 data is unknown, agency officials and advocates for people with disabilities believe there is an undercount of employees with disabilities. For example, despite the safeguards in place explaining the confidentiality of the data, agency officials and advocates for people with disabilities told us that some individuals with disabilities may not disclose their disability status out of concern that they will be subjected to discrimination. Similarly, EEOC reported that some persons with disabilities are reluctant to self-identify because they are concerned that such disclosure will preclude them from advancement. Additionally, some individuals may develop disabilities during federal employment and may not know how to or why they should update their disability status. We have reported that regularly encouraging employees to update their disability status allows agencies to be aware of any changes in their workforce. EEOC guidance recommends that agencies request that employees update their disability status every 2 to 4 years. As previously noted, disabled veterans with a compensable service-connected disability of 30 percent or more may be noncompetitively appointed and converted to a career appointment under 5 U.S.C. § 3112. agency’s ability to establish appropriate policies and goals, and assess progress towards those goals. Labor has taken several steps toward meeting the requirements of the executive order to improve return-to-work outcomes for employees injured on the job, including pursuing overall reform of the FECA system. Specifically, Labor developed new measures and targets to hold federal agencies accountable for improving their return-to-work outcomes within a 2-year period. Agencies were expected to improve return-to-work outcomes by 1 percent for fiscal year 2011 and an additional 2 percent in each of the following 3 years over the 2009 baseline. In fiscal year 2011, the federal government had a cumulative return-to-work rate of 91.6 percent, almost 5 percent better than the target rate of 86.7 percent. Goals such as these are useful tools to help agencies improve performance. Labor is also researching strategies that agencies can use to increase the successful return-to-work of employees who have sustained disabilities as a result of workplace injuries or illnesses. The results of this study are expected to be released in September 2012. Another Labor initiative is aimed at helping the federal government rehire injured federal workers who are not able to return to the job at which they were injured. OWCP initiated a 6-month pilot project in May 2011 to explore how Schedule A noncompetitive hiring authority might be used to rehire injured federal workers under FECA. As part of the project, OWCP provided guidance to claims staff, rehabilitation specialists, rehabilitation counselors, and employing agencies on the process of Schedule A certification and the steps it will take to facilitate Schedule A placements. According to Labor, the pilot identified obstacles to reemployment and provided input needed to determine whether such an effort can be expanded to other federal agencies. Identified obstacles included unanticipated questions from potential workers, such as if acceptance of a Schedule A designation would require a “probationary” period, and what impact acceptance of a Schedule A position would have on their retirement benefits. Of the 48 individuals Labor screened for Schedule A certification, 45 obtained certification, of whom 5 have been placed into federal employment. Each of the four agencies we reviewed submitted a plan for implementing the executive order as required. Only VA’s plan, as initially submitted, met all of OPM’s criteria for satisfying the requirements of the executive order (see table 2). Education and SSA revised their plans based on feedback from OPM. Specifically, Education’s revised plan states that Education will hire individuals with disabilities in all occupations and across all job series and grades. Education also clarified its commitment to coordinate with Labor to improve return-to-work outcomes through the POWER Initiative, and to engage and train managers on Schedule A hiring authority. Further, Education increased its goals for the percentage of job opportunity announcements that include information related to individuals with disabilities. SSA revised its plan to include goals and planned activities under the POWER Initiative, including quarterly monitoring of return-to-work successes under the program and a strategy for identifying injured employees who would benefit from reasonable accommodations and reassignment. OMB submitted its plan in March 2012 but, according to OMB officials, the agency has not received feedback from OPM. Agencies had positive views about the executive order’s requirement that they develop written plans to increase the number of federal employees with disabilities. In particular, Education, SSA, and VA said that the executive order provided an opportunity to further develop the written plans they already had in place for hiring and retaining employees with disabilities. Agencies were supportive of the goal of increasing the hiring and retention of federal employees with disabilities, and reported few challenges in implementing their plans to achieve this goal. Officials at all of the agencies we interviewed cited funding constraints as a potential obstacle to hiring more employees with disabilities. OMB officials also said that it was a challenge to identify individuals with the right skills and experience to fill their positions. For example, officials said that many of the candidates on OPM’s list of Schedule A-certified individuals have entry level skills and not the more advanced skills and experience that are required for positions at OMB. Agency officials cited no special challenges with respect to retaining employees with disabilities at their agencies. In October 2010, we reported on eight leading practices that could help the federal government become a model employer for individuals with disabilities. These practices, which are consistent with the executive order’s goal of increasing the number of individuals with disabilities in the federal government, have been implemented to varying degrees by the four agencies we contacted for this review. Top leadership commitment: Involvement of top agency leadership is necessary to overcome the resistance to change that agencies could face when trying to address attitudinal barriers to hiring individuals with disabilities. When leaders communicate their commitment throughout the organization, they send a clear message about the seriousness and business relevance of diversity management. Leaders at the agencies we talked with have, to varying degrees, communicated their commitment to hiring and retaining individuals with disabilities to their employees. Education has issued annual policy statements to its employees ensuring equal employment opportunity for all applicants and employees, including those with targeted disabilities, and officials told us that they routinely host events that address issues related to hiring and promoting equal employment opportunity. For example, in October 2008, Education hosted an event to encourage hiring individuals with disabilities and distributed a written guide about using Schedule A hiring authority to facilitate hiring individuals with targeted or severe disabilities, as well as disabled veterans. OMB officials said that it is briefing managers on the requirements of the executive order and that it planned to communicate the agency’s commitment to implementing the executive order to all staff in May 2012. SSA’s Commissioner announced his support for employing individuals with disabilities and encouraged employees to continue efforts to hire and promote these individuals in a March 2009 broadcast to all employees. VA said that the Secretary regularly communicates his commitment to hiring and retaining employees with disabilities through memorandums to all employees. In a September 2010 memorandum, the Secretary announced the agency’s goal of increasing the percentage of individuals with targeted disabilities that it hires and employs to 2 percent in fiscal year 2011. Accountability: Accountability is critical to ensuring the success of an agency’s efforts to implement leading practices and improve the employment of individuals with disabilities. To ensure accountability, agencies should set goals, determine measures to assess progress toward goals, evaluate staff and agency success in helping meet goals, and report results publicly. Education, SSA and VA’s disability hiring plans all include goals that will allow them to measure their progress toward meeting the goals of the executive order. Prior to the executive order, Education issued a Disability Employment Program Strategic Plan for fiscal years 2011-2013 that established goals related to reasonable accommodations, and recruitment and retention, and offered strategies for meeting these goals, as well as ways to track and measure agency progress. At SSA, accountability for results related to the executive order is included in the performance plan of the senior-level official responsible for implementing it. VA specifically holds senior executives accountable for meeting agency numerical goals by including these goals in their contracts. Additionally, VA senior executives’ contracts include a performance element for meeting hiring goals for individuals with targeted disabilities. OMB has not yet developed such goals. Regular surveying of the workforce on disability issues: Regularly surveying their workforces allows agencies to have more information about potential barriers to employment for people with disabilities, the effectiveness of their reasonable accommodation practices, and the extent to which employees with disabilities find the work environment friendly. To collect this information, agencies should survey their workforces at all stages of their employment, including asking employees to complete the SF-256 when they are hired, and asking relevant questions on employee feedback surveys and in exit interviews. VA officials said that they encourage new employees to complete the SF- 256, and SSA reminds all employees to annually review their human resource records and update or correct information, including disability data. In addition, all of the agencies we contacted survey employees to solicit feedback on a range of topics. However, only SSA and VA include a question on disability status or reasonable accommodations on these surveys. In addition, Education and SSA said that they routinely conduct exit surveys to solicit information from employees who separate from service about their reasons for leaving. While VA has an exit survey, officials said it is not consistently administered to all employees who separate. Education officials said that they have additional means of obtaining information about barriers for employees with disabilities. For example, senior managers hold open forums with staff, and employees can submit feedback to management through the agency’s Intranet. Education officials also reported that employees with disabilities have formed their own group to address access to assistive technology, which has helped Education to obtain improved technology, such as videophones. OMB officials said that their Diversity Council and Personnel Advisory Board provide forums for employees to discuss diversity issues, including those related to disabilities, and share them with senior leadership. Better coordination of roles and responsibilities: Often the responsibilities related to employment of people with disabilities are dispersed, which can create barriers to hiring if agency staff defer taking action, thinking that it is someone else’s responsibility. Coordination across agencies can encourage agencies with special expertise in addressing employment obstacles for individuals with disabilities to share their knowledge with agencies that have not yet developed this expertise. All of the agencies we interviewed had, to some extent, coordinated within and across agencies to improve their recruitment and retention efforts. Specifically, each agency has a designated section 508 coordinator who assists the agency in ensuring that, as required by section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act, employees with disabilities have access to information and data that are comparable to that provided to those without disabilities. In addition, each agency has a single office or primary point of contact that is responsible for overseeing activities related to hiring and retaining employees with disabilities. Officials at all of the agencies we talked to said their agencies engaged in one or more interagency efforts to address disability issues. All of these agencies participate in the CHCO Council, which facilitates sharing of best practices and challenges related to human capital issues, including those related to employees with disabilities. In addition, Education, OMB and SSA officials said that they work with state vocational rehabilitation agencies, which can help them identify accommodations that may be needed for new hires with disabilities. Education and SSA also participate in the Federal Disability Workforce Consortium, an interagency partnership working to improve recruitment, hiring, retention, and advancement of individuals with disabilities by sharing information on disability employment issues across government. SSA and VA have also participated in the Workforce Recruitment Program for College Students VA and Education have also worked together to assist with Disabilities; disabled veterans by providing unpaid work experience at Education, which may lead to permanent employment. Managed by Labor’s Office of Disability Employment Policy and the Department of Defense’s Office of Diversity Management and Equal Opportunity, this program is a recruitment and referral effort that connects federal sector employers nationwide with highly motivated college students and recent graduates with disabilities. said that the site is useful for seeing what other agencies are doing, and that they have also shared their own practices on the site. Training for staff at all levels: Agencies can leverage training to communicate expectations about implementation of policies and procedures related to improving employment of people with disabilities, and help disseminate leading practices that can help improve outcomes. All of the selected agencies provide some training for staff at all levels on the importance of workforce diversity. They also require managers and supervisors to take training on hiring procedures related to individuals with disabilities, and the use of Schedule A hiring authority. In addition, VA requires employees at all levels to take training specifically devoted to the legal rights of individuals with disabilities. At Education, this training is required for managers and supervisors, while at SSA it is available but optional for all employees. Career development opportunities: Opportunities for employees with disabilities to participate in work details, rotational assignments, and mentoring programs can lead to increased retention and improved employee satisfaction, and improve employment outcomes by helping managers identify employees with high potential. All of the agencies we interviewed provided special work details or rotational assignments for all employees; one reported having a program exclusively for those with disabilities. Specifically, Education uses Project SEARCH to provide internships for students with disabilities to help them become ready to work through on-the-job training. Education officials reported that some of these internships have led to permanent employment at Education. A flexible work environment: Flexible work schedules, telework, and other types of reasonable accommodations are valuable tools for the recruitment and retention of employees, regardless of disability status. Such arrangements can make it easier for employees with health impairments to successfully function in the work environment or facilitate an injured employee’s return to work. All of the agencies we interviewed provide flexible work arrangements, including flexible work schedules and teleworking. These agencies also make assistive technologies, such as screen reader software, available for employees with disabilities, which can facilitate their ability to take advantage of flexible work arrangements. Education, OMB, and SSA also offer all employees opportunities for job sharing. Centralized funding for reasonable accommodations: Having a central budget at the highest level of the agency can help ensure that employees with disabilities have access to reasonable accommodations by removing these expenses from local operational budgets and thus reducing managers’ concerns about their costs. Education, SSA, and VA use centralized funding accounts to pay for reasonable accommodations for employees with disabilities. At Education, a centralized fund is usually used to cover expenses related to providing readers, interpreters, and personal attendants. However, in cases where these services are needed on a daily basis, Education may require the operating unit to hire someone full-time and pay for this from their unit budget. OMB provides funding from its own budget to pay for reasonable accommodations, rather than receiving funding from the Executive Office of the President. OMB officials also told us that they also have been able to rely on the Department of Defense’s Computer/Electronic Accommodations Program to help provide reasonable accommodations for some of the employees. This program facilitates access to assistive technology and services to people with disabilities, federal managers, supervisors, and information technology professionals by providing a single point of access for executive branch agencies. As the nation’s largest employer, the federal government has the opportunity to be a model for the employment of people with disabilities. Consistent with the July 2010 executive order, OPM, Labor, and other agencies have helped provide the framework for federal agencies to take proactive steps to improve the hiring and retention of persons with disabilities. However, nearly 2 years after the executive order was signed, the federal government is not on track to achieve the executive order’s goals. Although federal agencies have taken the first step by submitting action plans to OPM for review, many agency plans do not meet the criteria identified by OPM as essential to becoming a model employer of people with disabilities. Though the executive order does not specifically authorize OPM to require agencies to address deficiencies, regularly reporting to the president and others on agency progress in addressing these deficiencies may compel agencies to address them and better position the federal government to reach the goals of the executive order. Further, officials responsible for hiring at federal agencies need to acquire the necessary knowledge and skills to proactively recruit, hire, and retain individuals with disabilities. Agency officials we spoke with said more comprehensive training on the tools available to them, including the requirements of Schedule A hiring authority, is needed. While the mandatory training program remains in development, until it is fully developed and communicated to agencies, opportunities to better inform relevant agency officials on how to increase the employment of individuals with disabilities may be missed. Finally, concerns have been raised by stakeholders, including EEOC, OPM, and advocates for people with disabilities, about the reliability of government statistics on the number of individuals with disabilities in the federal government. Most of the concerns focus on the likelihood of underreporting given the reliance on voluntary disclosure, but the extent of the underreporting is unknown. Unreliable data hinder OPM’s ability to measure the population of federal workers with disabilities and may prevent the federal government from developing needed policies and procedures that support efforts to become a model employer of people with disabilities. Determining the accuracy of SF-256 data, for example, by examining the extent to which employees voluntarily disclose their disability status and reasons for nondisclosure, is an essential step for ensuring that OPM can measure progress towards the executive order’s goals. To ensure that the federal government is well positioned to become a model employer of individuals with disabilities, we recommend that the Director of OPM take the following three actions: 1. Incorporate information about plan deficiencies into its regular reporting to the president on agencies’ progress in implementing their plans, and inform agencies about this process to better ensure that the plan deficiencies are addressed. 2. Expedite the development of the mandatory training programs for hiring managers and human resource personnel on the employment of individuals with disabilities, as required by the executive order. 3. Assess the extent to which the SF-256 accurately measures progress toward the executive order’s goal and explore options for improving the accuracy of SF-256 reporting, if needed, including strategies for encouraging employees to voluntarily disclose their disability status. Any such strategies must comply with legal standards governing disability-related inquiries, including ensuring that employee rights to voluntarily disclose a disability are not infringed upon. We provided a draft of this report to Education, EEOC, Labor, OMB, OPM, SSA, and VA for review and comment. In written comments, OPM agreed with findings and recommendations identified in the report, and described actions being implemented in an effort to address them. To better ensure agencies address deficiencies identified in their disability hiring plans, OPM has begun notifying agencies that it plans to report remaining deficiencies to the president and on the OPM website by August 2012. With regard to the need to expedite the development of the mandatory training program, OPM, in coordination with partner agencies has identified training for hiring managers and supervisors, and Human Resource personnel. Finally, OPM stated that it is engaged in discussions with the White House and stakeholder agencies to better define questions on the SF-256 to increase response rates. OPM also said it plans to work with EEOC and Labor to develop guidance for agencies to encourage voluntary self-disclosure through annual re-surveying of the workforce and providing employees with the option to complete the SF-256 when they request a reasonable accommodation. OPM expects to complete these efforts by January 2013. While these actions may help improve the accuracy of the SF-256 data, we think taking steps to assess the accuracy of the data will enhance OPM’s efforts. For example, understanding the extent to which employees do not voluntarily self- disclose their disability status and the reasons why may help target the messages agencies can use to encourage voluntary self-disclosure. Without such an understanding, OPM and agencies may miss opportunities to increase the accuracy of the data collected on the SF- 256. Education, EEOC, OMB, OPM, and SSA provided technical comments, which have been incorporated into the report as appropriate. Labor and VA had no comments. We are sending copies of this report to Education, EEOC, Labor, OMB, OPM, SSA, and VA and to the appropriate congressional committees and other interested parties.

According to OPM, the federal government is not on track to meet the goals of the executive order, which committed the federal government to hire 100,000 workers with disabilities over the next 5 years. GAO was asked to examine the efforts that (1) OPM and Labor have made in overseeing federal efforts to implement the executive order; and (2) selected agencies have taken to implement the executive order and to adopt leading practices for hiring and retaining employees with disabilities. To conduct this work, GAO reviewed relevant agency documents and interviewed appropriate agency officials. GAO conducted case studies at Education, SSA, VA, and OMB. The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) and the Department of Labor (Labor) have taken steps to implement the executive order and help agencies recruit, hire, and retain more employees with disabilities. OPM provided guidance to help agencies develop disability hiring plans and reviewed the 66 plans submitted. OPM identified deficiencies in most of the plans. For example, though 40 of 66 agencies included a process for increasing the use of a special hiring authority to increase the hiring of people with disabilities, 59 agencies did not meet all of OPMs review criteria, and 32 agencies had not addressed plan deficiencies as of April 2012. In response to executive order reporting requirements, OPM officials said they had briefed the White House on issues related to implementation, but they did not provide information on deficiencies in all plans. While the order does not specify what information these reports should include beyond addressing progress, providing information on deficiencies would enable the White House to hold agencies accountable. OPM is still developing the mandatory training programs for officials on the employment of individuals with disabilities, as required by the executive order. Several elective training efforts exist to help agencies hire and retain employees with disabilities, but agency officials said that more information would help them better use available tools. To track and measure progress towards meeting the executive orders goals, OPM relies on employees to voluntarily disclose a disability. Yet, agency officials, including OPMs, are concerned about the quality of the data. For example, agency officials noted that people may not disclose their disability due to concerns about how the information may be used. Without quality data, agencies may be challenged to effectively implement and assess the impact of their disability hiring plans. The Department of Education (Education), Social Security Administration (SSA), Office of Management and Budget (OMB), and Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) submitted disability hiring plans, and have taken steps to implement leading practices for increasing employment of individuals with disabilities, such as demonstrating top leadership commitment. The executive order provided SSA, VA, and Education an opportunity to further develop existing written plans. However, officials at these agencies cited funding constraints as a potential obstacle to hiring more employees with disabilities. In terms of leading practices, all four agencies have communicated their commitment to hiring and retaining individuals with disabilities and coordinated within or across other agencies to improve their recruitment and retention efforts. For example, each agency has a single point of contact to help ensure that employees with disabilities have access to information that is comparable to that provided to those without disabilities, and for overseeing activities related to hiring and retaining employees with disabilities. In addition, VA holds senior managers accountable for meeting hiring goals by including targets in their contracts. Each agency requires training for managers and supervisors on procedures for hiring individuals with disabilities, and VA further requires that all employees receive training on the legal rights of individuals with disabilities. Education, SSA, and VA rely on centralized funding accounts to pay for reasonable accommodations. GAO recommends that OPM: (1) incorporate information about plan deficiencies into its required regular reporting to the president on implementing the executive order and inform agencies about this process; (2) expedite the development of the mandatory training programs required by the executive order; and (3) assess the accuracy of the data used to measure progress toward the executive orders goals and, if needed, explore options for improving its ability to measure the population of federal employees with disabilities, including strategies for encouraging employees to voluntarily disclose disability status. OPM agreed with GAOs recommendations.",govreport
"IAEA is an independent organization affiliated with the United Nations. Its governing bodies include the General Conference, composed of representatives of the 138 IAEA member states, and the 35-member Board of Governors, which provides overall policy direction and oversight. The Secretariat, headed by the Director General, is responsible for implementing the policies and programs of the General Conference and Board of Governors. The United States is a permanent member of the Board of Governors. IAEA derives its authority to establish and administer safeguards from its statute, the Treaty on the Non-proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and regional nonproliferation treaties, bilateral commitments between states, and project agreements with states. Since the NPT came into force in 1970, it has been subject to review by signatory states every 5 years. The 1995 NPT Review and Extension conference extended the life of the treaty indefinitely, and the latest review conference occurred in May 2005. Article III of the NPT binds each of the treaty’s 184 signatory states that had not manufactured and exploded a nuclear device prior to January 1, 1967 (referred to in the treaty as non-nuclear weapon states) to conclude an agreement with IAEA that applies safeguards to all source and special nuclear material in all peaceful nuclear activities within the state’s territory, under its jurisdiction, or carried out anywhere under its control. The five nuclear weapons states that are parties to the NPT—China, France, the Russian Federation, the United Kingdom, and the United States—are not obligated by the NPT to accept IAEA safeguards. However, each nuclear weapons state has voluntarily entered into legally binding safeguards agreements with IAEA, and has submitted designated nuclear materials and facilities to IAEA safeguards to demonstrate to the non- nuclear weapon states their willingness to share in the administrative and commercial costs of safeguards. (App. I lists states that are subject to safeguards, as of August 2006.) India, Israel, and Pakistan are not parties to the NPT or other regional nonproliferation treaties. India and Pakistan are known to have nuclear weapons programs and to have detonated several nuclear devices during May 1998. Israel is also believed to have produced nuclear weapons. Additionally, North Korea joined the NPT in 1985 and briefly accepted safeguards in 1992 and 1993, but expelled inspectors and threatened to withdraw from the NPT when IAEA inspections uncovered evidence of undeclared plutonium production. North Korea announced its withdrawal from the NPT in early 2003, which under the terms of the treaty, terminated its comprehensive safeguards agreement. IAEA’s safeguards objectives, as traditionally applied under comprehensive safeguards agreements, are to account for the amount of a specific type of material necessary to produce a nuclear weapon, and the time it would take a state to divert this material from peaceful use and produce a nuclear weapon. IAEA attempts to meet these objectives by using a set of activities by which it seeks to verify that nuclear material subject to safeguards is not diverted to nuclear weapons or other proscribed purposes. For example, IAEA inspectors visit a facility at certain intervals to ensure that any diversion of nuclear material is detected before a state has had time to produce a nuclear weapon. IAEA also uses material-accounting measures to verify quantities of nuclear material declared to the agency and any changes in the quantities over time. Additionally, containment measures are used to control access to and the movement of nuclear material. Finally, IAEA deploys surveillance devices, such as video cameras, to detect the movements of nuclear material and discourage tampering with IAEA’s containment measures. The Nuclear Suppliers Group was established in 1975 after India tested a nuclear explosive device. In 1978, the Suppliers Group published its first set of guidelines governing the exports of nuclear materials and equipment. These guidelines established several requirements for Suppliers Group members, including the acceptance of IAEA safeguards at facilities using controlled nuclear-related items. In 1992, the Suppliers Group broadened its guidelines by requiring countries receiving nuclear exports to agree to IAEA’s safeguards as a condition of supply. As of August 2006, the Nuclear Suppliers Group had 45 members, including the United States. (See app. II for a list of signatory countries.) IAEA has taken steps to strengthen safeguards by more aggressively seeking assurances that a country is not pursuing a clandestine nuclear program. In a radical departure from past practices of only verifying the peaceful use of a country’s declared nuclear material at declared facilities, IAEA has begun to develop the capability to independently evaluate all aspects of a country’s nuclear activities. The first strengthened safeguards steps, which began in the early 1990s, increased the agency’s ability to monitor declared and undeclared activities at nuclear facilities. These measures were implemented under the agency’s existing legal authority under comprehensive safeguards agreements and include (1) conducting short notice and unannounced inspections, (2) collecting and analyzing environmental samples to detect traces of nuclear material, and (3) using measurement and surveillance systems that operate unattended and can be used to transmit data about the status of nuclear materials directly to IAEA headquarters. The second series of steps began in 1997 when IAEA’s Board of Governors approved the Additional Protocol. Under the Additional Protocol, IAEA has the right, among other things, to (1) receive more comprehensive information about a country’s nuclear activities, such as research and development activities, and (2) conduct “complementary access,” which enables IAEA to expand its inspection rights for the purpose of ensuring the absence of undeclared nuclear material and activities. Because the Additional Protocol broadens IAEA’s authority and the requirements on countries under existing safeguards agreements, each country must take certain actions to bring it into force. For each country with a safeguards agreement, IAEA independently evaluates all information available about the country’s nuclear activities and draws conclusions regarding a country’s compliance with its safeguards commitments. A major source of information available to the agency is data submitted by countries to IAEA under their safeguards agreements, referred to as state declarations. Countries are required to provide an expanded declaration of their nuclear activities within 180 days of bringing the Additional Protocol into force. Examples of information provided in an Additional Protocol declaration include the manufacturing of key nuclear-related equipment; research and development activities related to the nuclear fuel cycle; the use and contents of buildings on a nuclear site; and the location and operational status of uranium mines. The agency uses the state declarations as a starting point to determine if the information provided by the country is consistent and accurate with all other information available based on its own review. IAEA uses various types of information to verify the state declaration. Inspections of nuclear facilities and other locations with nuclear material are the cornerstone of the agency’s data collection efforts. Under the Additional Protocol, IAEA has the authority to conduct complementary access at any place on a site or other location with nuclear material in order to ensure the absence of undeclared nuclear material and activities, confirm the decommissioned status of facilities where nuclear material was used or stored, and resolve questions or inconsistencies related to the correctness and completeness of the information provided by a country on activities at other declared or undeclared locations. During complementary access, IAEA inspectors may carry out a number of activities, including (1) making visual observations, (2) collecting environmental samples, (3) using radiation detection equipment and measurement devices, and (4) applying seals. In 2004, IAEA conducted 124 complementary access in 27 countries. In addition to its verification activities, IAEA uses other sources of information to evaluate countries’ declarations. These sources include information from the agency’s internal databases, open sources, satellite imagery, and outside groups. The agency established two new offices within the Department of Safeguards to focus primarily on open source and satellite imagery data collection. Analysts use Internet searches to acquire information generally available to the public from open sources, such as scientific literature, trade and export publications, commercial companies, and the news media. In addition, the agency uses commercially available satellite imagery to supplement the information it receives through its open source information. Satellite imagery is used to monitor the status and condition of declared nuclear facilities and verify state declarations of certain sites. The agency also uses its own databases, such as those for nuclear safety, nuclear waste, and technical cooperation, to expand its general knowledge about countries’ nuclear and nuclear- related activities. In some cases, IAEA receives information from third parties, including other countries. Department of State and IAEA officials told us that strengthened safeguards measures have successfully revealed previously undisclosed nuclear activities in Iran, South Korea, and Egypt. Specifically, IAEA and Department of State officials noted that strengthened safeguards measures, such as collecting and analyzing environmental samples, helped the agency verify some of Iran’s nuclear activities. The measures also allowed IAEA to conclude in September 2005 that Iran was not complying with its safeguards obligations because it failed to report all of its nuclear activities to IAEA. As a result, in July 2006, Iran was referred to the U.N. Security Council, which in turn demanded that Iran suspend its uranium enrichment activities or face possible diplomatic and economic sanctions. In August 2004, as a result of preparations to submit its initial declaration under the Additional Protocol, South Korea notified IAEA that it had not previously disclosed nuclear experiments involving the enrichment of uranium and plutonium separation. IAEA sent a team of inspectors to South Korea to investigate this case. In November 2004, IAEA’s Director General reported to the Board of Governors that although the quantities of nuclear material involved were not significant, the nature of the activities and South Korea’s failure to report these activities in a timely manner posed a serious concern. IAEA is continuing to verify the correctness and completeness of South Korea’s declarations. IAEA inspectors have investigated evidence of past undeclared nuclear activities in Egypt based on the agency’s review of open source information that had been published by current and former Egyptian nuclear officials. Specifically, in late 2004, the agency found evidence that Egypt had engaged in undeclared activities at least 20 years ago by using small amounts of nuclear material to conduct experiments related to producing plutonium and highly enriched uranium. In January 2005, the Egyptian government announced that it was fully cooperating with IAEA and that the matter was limited in scope. IAEA inspectors have made several visits to Egypt to investigate this matter. IAEA’s Secretariat reported these activities to its Board of Governors. Despite these successes, a group of safeguards experts recently cautioned that a determined country can still conceal a nuclear weapons program. IAEA faces a number of limitations that impact its ability to draw conclusions—with absolute assurance—about whether a country is developing a clandestine nuclear weapons program. For example, IAEA does not have unfettered inspection rights and cannot make visits to suspected sites anywhere at any time. According to the Additional Protocol, complementary access to resolve questions related to the correctness and completeness of the information provided by the country or to resolve inconsistencies must usually be arranged with at least 24- hours advanced notice. Complementary access to buildings on sites where IAEA inspectors are already present are usually conducted with a 2-hour advanced notice. Furthermore, IAEA officials told us that there are practical problems that restrict access. For example, inspectors must be issued a visa to visit certain countries, a process which cannot normally be completed in less than 24 hours. In some cases, nuclear sites are in remote locations and IAEA inspectors need to make travel arrangements, such as helicopter transportation, in advance, which requires that the country be notified prior to the visit. A November 2004 study by a group of safeguards experts appointed by IAEA’s Director General evaluated the agency’s safeguards program to examine how effectively and efficiently strengthened safeguards measures were being implemented. Specifically, the group’s mission was to evaluate the progress, effectiveness, and impact of implementing measures to enhance the agency’s ability to draw conclusions about the non-diversion of nuclear material placed under safeguards and, for relevant countries, the absence of undeclared nuclear material and activities. The group concluded that generally IAEA had done a very good job implementing strengthened safeguards despite budgetary and other constraints. However, the group noted that IAEA’s ability to detect undeclared activities remains largely untested. If a country decides to divert nuclear material or conduct undeclared activities, it will deliberately work to prevent IAEA from discovering this. Furthermore, IAEA and member states should be clear that the conclusions drawn by the agency cannot be regarded as absolute. This view has been reinforced by the former Deputy Director General for Safeguards who has stated that even for countries with strengthened safeguards in force, there are limitations on the types of information and locations accessible to IAEA inspectors. There are a number of weaknesses that hamper IAEA’s ability to effectively implement strengthened safeguards. IAEA has only limited information about the nuclear activities of 4 key countries that are not members of the NPT—India, Israel, North Korea, and Pakistan. India, Israel, and Pakistan have special agreements with IAEA that limit the agency’s activities to monitoring only specific material, equipment, and facilities. However, since these countries are not signatories to the NPT, they do not have comprehensive safeguards agreements with IAEA, and are not required to declare all of their nuclear material to the agency. In addition, these countries are only required to declare exports of nuclear material previously declared to IAEA. With the recent revelations of the illicit international trade in nuclear material and equipment, IAEA officials stated that they need more information on these countries’ nuclear exports. For North Korea, IAEA has even less information, since the country expelled IAEA inspectors and removed surveillance equipment at nuclear facilities in December 2002 and withdrew from the NPT in January 2003. These actions have raised widespread concern that North Korea diverted some of its nuclear material to produce nuclear weapons. Another major weakness is that more than half, or 111 out of 189, of the NPT signatories have not yet brought the Additional Protocol into force, as of August 2006. (App. I lists the status of countries’ safeguards agreements with IAEA). Without the Additional Protocol, IAEA must limit its inspection efforts to declared nuclear material and facilities, making it harder to detect clandestine nuclear programs. Of the 111 countries that have not adopted the Additional Protocol, 21 are engaged in significant nuclear activities, including Egypt, North Korea, and Syria. In addition, safeguards are significantly limited or not applied in about 60 percent, or 112 out of 189, of the NPT signatory countries—either because they have an agreement (known as a small quantities protocol) with IAEA, and are not subject to most safeguards measures, or because they have not concluded a comprehensive safeguards agreement with IAEA. Countries with small quantities of nuclear material make up about 41 percent of the NPT signatories and about one-third of the countries that have the Additional Protocol in force. Since 1971, IAEA’s Board of Governors has authorized the Director General to conclude an agreement, known as a small quantities protocol, with 90 countries and, as of August 2006, 78 of these agreements were in force. IAEA’s Board of Governors has approved the protocols for these countries without having IAEA verify that they met the requirements for it. Even if these countries bring the Additional Protocol into force, IAEA does not have the right to conduct inspections or install surveillance equipment at certain nuclear facilities. According to IAEA and Department of State officials, this is a weakness in the agency’s ability to detect clandestine nuclear activities or transshipments of nuclear material and equipment through the country. In September 2005, the Board of Governors directed IAEA to negotiate with countries to make changes to the protocols, including reinstating the agency’s right to conduct inspections. As of August 2006, IAEA amended the protocols for 4 countries—Ecuador, Mali, Palau, and Tajikistan. The application of safeguards is further limited because 31 countries that have signed the NPT have not brought into force a comprehensive safeguards agreement with IAEA. The NPT requires non-nuclear weapons states to conclude comprehensive safeguards agreements with IAEA within 18 months of becoming a party to the Treaty. However, IAEA’s Director General has stated that these 31 countries have failed to fulfill their legal obligations. Moreover, 27 of the 31 have not yet brought comprehensive safeguards agreements into force more than 10 years after becoming party to the NPT, including Chad, Kenya, and Saudi Arabia. Last, IAEA is facing a looming human capital crisis that may hamper the agency’s ability to meet its safeguards mission. In 2005, we reported that about 51 percent, or 38 out of 75, of IAEA’s senior safeguards inspectors and high-level management officials, such as the head of the Department of Safeguards and the directors responsible for overseeing all inspection activities of nuclear programs, are retiring in the next 5 years. According to U.S. officials, this significant loss of knowledge and expertise could compromise the quality of analysis of countries’ nuclear programs. For example, several inspectors with expertise in uranium enrichment techniques, which is a primary means to produce nuclear weapons material, are retiring at a time when demand for their skills in detecting clandestine nuclear activities is growing. While IAEA has taken a number of steps to address these human capital issues, officials from the Department of State and the U.S. Mission to the U.N. System Organizations in Vienna have expressed concern that IAEA is not adequately planning to replace staff with critical skills needed to fulfill its strengthened safeguards mission. The Nuclear Suppliers Group, along with other multilateral export control groups, has helped stop, slow, or raise the costs of nuclear proliferation, according to nonproliferation experts. For example, as we reported in 2002, the Suppliers Group helped convince Argentina and Brazil to accept IAEA safeguards on their nuclear programs in exchange for expanded access to international cooperation for peaceful nuclear purposes. The Suppliers Group, along with other multilateral export control groups, has significantly reduced the availability of technology and equipment available to countries of concern, according to a State Department official. Moreover, nuclear export controls have made it more difficult, more costly, and more time consuming for proliferators to obtain the expertise and material needed to advance their nuclear program. The Nuclear Suppliers Group has also helped IAEA verify compliance with the NPT. In 1978, the Suppliers Group published the first guidelines governing exports of nuclear materials and equipment. These guidelines established several member requirements, including the requirement that members adhere to IAEA safeguards standards at facilities using controlled nuclear-related items. Subsequently, in 1992, the Nuclear Suppliers Group broadened its guidelines by requiring that members insist that non-member states have IAEA safeguards on all nuclear material and facilities as a condition of supply for their nuclear exports. With the revelation of Iraq’s nuclear weapons program, the Suppliers Group also created an export control system for dual-use items that established new controls for items that did not automatically fall under IAEA safeguards requirements. Despite these benefits, there are a number of weaknesses that could limit the Nuclear Suppliers Group’s ability to curb nuclear proliferation. Members of the Suppliers Group do not share complete export licensing information. Specifically, members do not always share information about licenses they have approved or denied for the sale of controversial items to nonmember states. Without this shared information, a member country could inadvertently license a controversial item to a country that has already been denied a license from another Suppliers Group member state. Furthermore, Suppliers Group members did not promptly review and agree upon common lists of items to control and approaches to controlling them. Each member must make changes to its national export control policies after members agree to change items on the control list. If agreed- upon changes to control lists are not adopted at the same time by all members, proliferators could exploit these time lags to obtain sensitive technologies by focusing on members that are slowest to incorporate the changes and sensitive items may still be traded to countries of concern. In addition, there are a number of obstacles to efforts aimed at strengthening the Nuclear Suppliers Group and other multilateral export control regimes. First, efforts to strengthen export controls have been hampered by a requirement that all members reach consensus about every decision made. Under the current process, a single member can block new reforms. U.S. and foreign government officials and nonproliferation experts all stressed that the regimes are consensus-based organizations and depend on the like-mindedness or cohesion of their members to be effective. However, members have found it especially difficult to reach consensus on such issues as making changes to procedures and control lists. The Suppliers Group reliance on consensus decision making will be tested by the United States request to exempt India from the Suppliers Group requirements to accept IAEA safeguards at all nuclear facilities. Second, since membership with the Suppliers Group is voluntary and nonbinding, there are no means to enforce compliance with members’ nonproliferation commitments. For example, the Suppliers Group has no direct means to impede Russia’s export of nuclear fuel to India, an act that the U.S. government said violated Russia’s commitment. Third, the rapid pace of nuclear technological change and the growing trade of sensitive items among proliferators complicate efforts to keep control lists current because these lists need to be updated more frequently. To help strengthen these regimes, GAO recommended in October 2002, that the Secretary of State establish a strategy that includes ways for Nuclear Suppliers Group members to improve information sharing, implement changes to export controls more consistently, and identify organizational changes that could help reform its activities. As of June 2006, the Nuclear Suppliers Group announced that it has revised its guidelines to improve information sharing. However, despite our recommendation, it has not yet agreed to share greater and more detailed information on approved exports of sensitive transfers to nonmember countries. Nevertheless, the Suppliers Group is examining changes to its procedures that assist IAEA’s efforts to strengthen safeguards. For example, at the 2005 Nuclear Suppliers Group plenary meeting, members discussed changing the requirements for exporting nuclear material and equipment by requiring nonmember countries to adopt IAEA’s Additional Protocol as a condition of supply. If approved by the Suppliers Group, the action would complement IAEA’s efforts to verify compliance with the NPT. Reducing the formidable proliferation risks posed by former Soviet weapons of mass destruction (WMD) assets is a U.S. national security interest. Since the fall of the Soviet Union, the United States, through a variety of programs, managed by the Departments of Energy, Defense (DOD), and State, has helped Russia and other former Soviet countries to secure nuclear material and warheads, detect illicitly trafficked nuclear material, eliminate excess stockpiles of weapons-usable nuclear material, and halt the continued production of weapons-grade plutonium. From fiscal year 1992 through fiscal year 2006, the Congress appropriated about $7 billion for nuclear nonproliferation efforts. However, U.S. assistance programs have faced a number of challenges, such as a lack of access to key sites and corruption of foreign officials, which could compromise the effectiveness of U.S. assistance. DOE’s Material Protection, Control, and Accounting (MPC&A) program has worked with Russia and other former Soviet countries since 1994 to provide enhanced physical protection systems at sites with weapons- usable nuclear material and warheads, implement material control and accounting upgrades to help keep track of the quantities of nuclear materials at sites, and consolidate material into fewer, more secure buildings. GAO last reported on the MPC&A program in 2003. At that time, a lack of access to many sites in Russia’s nuclear weapons complex had significantly impeded DOE’s progress in helping Russia to secure its nuclear material. We reported that DOE had completed work at only a limited number of buildings in Russia’s nuclear weapons complex, a network of sites involved in the construction of nuclear weapons where most of the nuclear material in Russia is stored. According to DOE, by the end of September 2006, the agency will have helped to secure 175 buildings with weapons-usable nuclear material in Russia and the former Soviet Union and 39 Russian Navy nuclear warhead sites. GAO is currently re-examining DOE’s efforts, including the progress DOE has made since 2003 in securing nuclear material and warheads in Russia and other countries and the challenges DOE faces in completing its work. While securing nuclear materials and warheads where they are stored is considered to be the first layer of defense against nuclear theft, there is no guarantee that such items will not be stolen or lost. Recognizing this fact, DOE, DOD, and State, through seven different programs, have provided radiation detection equipment since 1994 to 36 countries, including many countries of the former Soviet Union. These programs seek to combat nuclear smuggling and are seen as a second line of defense against nuclear theft. The largest and most successful of these efforts is DOE’s Second Line of Defense program (SLD). We reported in March 2006 that, through the SLD program, DOE had provided radiation detection equipment and training at 83 sites in Russia, Greece, and Lithuania since 1998. However, we also noted that U.S. radiation detection assistance efforts faced challenges, including corruption of some foreign border security officials, technical limitations of some radiation detection equipment, and inadequate maintenance of some equipment. To address these challenges, U.S. agencies plan to take a number of steps, including combating corruption by installing communications links between individual border sites and national command centers so that detection alarm data can be simultaneously evaluated by multiple officials. The United States is also helping Russia to eliminate excess stockpiles of nuclear material (highly enriched uranium and plutonium). In February 1993, the United States agreed to purchase from Russia 500 metric tons of highly enriched uranium (HEU) extracted from dismantled Russian nuclear weapons over a 20-year period. Russia agreed to dilute, or blend- down, the material into low enriched uranium (LEU), which is of significantly less proliferation risk, so that it could be made into fuel for commercial nuclear power reactors before shipping it to the United States. As of June 27, 2006, 276 metric tons of Russian HEU—derived from more than 11,000 dismantled nuclear weapons—have been downblended into LEU for use in U.S. commercial nuclear reactors. Similarly, in 2000, the United States and Russia committed to the transparent disposition of 34 metric tons each of weapon-grade plutonium. The plutonium will be converted into a more proliferation-resistant form called mixed-oxide (MOX) fuel that will be used in commercial nuclear power plants. In addition to constructing a MOX fuel fabrication plant at its Savannah River Site, DOE is also assisting Russia in constructing a similar facility for the Russian plutonium. Russia’s continued operation of three plutonium production reactors poses a serious proliferation threat. These reactors produce about 1.2 metric tons of plutonium each year—enough for about 300 nuclear weapons. DOE’s Elimination of Weapons-Grade Plutonium Production program seeks to facilitate the reactors’ closure by building or refurbishing two fossil fuel plants that will replace the heat and electricity that will be lost with the shutdown of Russia’s three plutonium production reactors. DOE plans to complete the first of the two replacement plants in 2008 and the second in 2011. When we reported on this program in June 2004, we noted that DOE faced challenges in implementing its program, including ensuring Russia’s commitment to shutting down the reactors, the rising cost of building the replacement fossil fuel plants, and concerns about the thousands of Russian nuclear workers who will lose their jobs when the reactors are shut down. We made a number of recommendations, which DOE has implemented, including reaching agreement with Russia on the specific steps to be taken to shut down the reactors and development of a plan to work with other U.S. government programs to assist Russia in finding alternate employment for the skilled nuclear workers who will lose their jobs when the reactors are shut down. Mr. Chairman, this concludes my prepared statement. I would be pleased to respond to any questions you or other Members of the Subcommittee may have at this time.

Carroll, Leland Cogliani, Lynn Cothern, Muriel J. Forster, Jeffrey Phillips, and Jim Shafer made key contributions to this testimony. Beth Hoffman León, Stephen Lord, Audrey Solis, and Pierre Toureille provided technical assistance. Although North Korea concluded a comprehensive safeguards agreement with IAEA in 1992, it announced its withdrawal from the NPT in January 2003. Secures radiological sources no longer needed in the U.S. and locates, identifies, recovers, consolidates, and enhances the security of radioactive materials outside the U.S. Global Nuclear Material Threat Reduction Eliminates Russia’s use of highly enriched uranium (HEU) in civilian nuclear facilities; returns U.S. and Russian-origin HEU and spent nuclear fuel from research reactors around the world; secures plutonium-bearing spent nuclear fuel from reactors in Kazakhstan; and addresses nuclear and radiological materials at vulnerable locations throughout the world. Provides replacement fossil-fuel energy that will allow Russia to shutdown its three remaining weapons-grade plutonium production reactors. Develops and delivers technology applications to strengthen capabilities to detect and verify undeclared nuclear programs; enhances the physical protection and proper accounting of nuclear material; and assists foreign national partners to meet safeguards commitments. Provides meaningful employment for former weapons of mass destruction weapons scientists. Provides material protection, control, and accounting upgrades to enhance the security of Navy HEU fuel and nuclear material. Provides material protection, control, and accounting upgrades to nuclear weapons, uranium enrichment, and material processing and storage sites. Enhances the security of proliferation-attractive nuclear material in Russia by supporting material protection, control, and accounting upgrade projects at Russian civilian nuclear facilities. Develops national and regional resources in the Russian Federation to help establish and sustain effective operation of upgraded nuclear material protection, control and accounting systems. Negotiates cooperative efforts with the Russian Federation and other key countries to strengthen the capability of enforcement officials to detect and deter illicit trafficking of nuclear and radiological material across international borders. This is accomplished through the detection, location and identification of nuclear and nuclear related materials, the development of response procedures and capabilities, and the establishment of required infrastructure elements to support the control of these materials. HEU Transparency Implementation project Monitors Russia to ensure that low enriched uranium (LEU) sold to the U.S. for civilian nuclear power plants is derived from weapons-usable HEU removed from dismantled Russian nuclear weapons. Disposes of surplus domestic HEU by down-blending it. Surplus U.S. Plutonium Disposition project Disposes of surplus domestic plutonium by fabricating it into mixed oxide (MOX) fuel for irradiation in existing, commercial nuclear reactors. Supports Russia’s efforts to dispose of its weapons-grade plutonium by working with the international community to help pay for Russia’s program. Provides training and equipment to assist Russia in determining the reliability of its guard forces. Enhances the safety and security of Russian nuclear weapons storage sites through the use of vulnerability assessments to determine specific requirements for upgrades. DOD will develop security designs to address those vulnerabilities and install equipment necessary to bring security standards consistent with those at U.S. nuclear weapons storage facilities. Nuclear Weapons Transportation Assists Russia in shipping nuclear warheads to more secure sites or dismantlement locations. Assists Russia in maintaining nuclear weapons cargo railcars. Funds maintenance of railcars until no longer feasible, then purchases replacement railcars to maintain 100 cars in service. DOD will procure 15 guard railcars to replace those retired from service. Guard railcars will be capable of monitoring security systems in the cargo railcars and transporting security force personnel. Provides emergency response vehicles containing hydraulic cutting tools, pneumatic jacks, and safety gear to enhance Russia’s ability to respond to possible accidents in transporting nuclear weapons. Meteorological, radiation detection and monitoring, and communications equipment is also included.

Safeguards allow IAEA to verify countries' compliance with the NPT. Since the discovery in 1991 of a clandestine nuclear weapons program in Iraq, IAEA has strengthened its safeguards system. In addition to IAEA's strengthened safeguards program, there are other U.S. and international efforts that have helped stem the spread of nuclear materials and technology that could be used for nuclear weapons programs. This testimony is based on GAO's report on IAEA safeguards issued in October 2005 (Nuclear Nonproliferation: IAEA Has Strengthened Its Safeguards and Nuclear Security Programs, but Weaknesses Need to Be Addressed, GAO-06-93 [Washington, D.C.: Oct. 7, 2005]). This testimony is also based on previous GAO work related to the Nuclear Suppliers Group--a group of more than 40 countries that have pledged to limit trade in nuclear materials, equipment, and technology to only countries that are engaged in peaceful nuclear activities--and U.S. assistance to Russia and other countries of the former Soviet Union for the destruction, protection, and detection of nuclear material and weapons. IAEA has taken steps to strengthen safeguards, including conducting more intrusive inspections, to seek assurances that countries are not developing clandestine weapons programs. IAEA has begun to develop the capability to independently evaluate all aspects of a country's nuclear activities. This is a radical departure from the past practice of only verifying the peaceful use of a country's declared nuclear material. However, despite successes in uncovering some countries' undeclared nuclear activities, safeguards experts cautioned that a determined country can still conceal a nuclear weapons program. In addition, there are a number of weaknesses that limit IAEA's ability to implement strengthened safeguards. First, IAEA has a limited ability to assess the nuclear activities of 4 key countries that are not NPT members--India, Israel, North Korea, and Pakistan. Second, more than half of the NPT signatories have not yet brought the Additional Protocol, which is designed to give IAEA new authority to search for clandestine nuclear activities, into force. Third, safeguards are significantly limited or not applied to about 60 percent of NPT signatories because they possess small quantities of nuclear material, and are exempt from inspections, or they have not concluded a comprehensive safeguards agreement. Finally, IAEA faces a looming human capital crisis caused by the large number of inspectors and safeguards management personnel expected to retire in the next 5 years. In addition to IAEA's strengthened safeguards program, there are other U.S. and international efforts that have helped stem the spread of nuclear materials and technology. The Nuclear Suppliers Group has helped to constrain trade in nuclear material and technology that could be used to develop nuclear weapons. However, there are a number of weaknesses that could limit the Nuclear Suppliers Group's ability to curb proliferation. For example, members of the Suppliers Group do not always share information about licenses they have approved or denied for the sale of controversial items to nonmember states. Without this shared information, a member country could inadvertently license a controversial item to a country that has already been denied a license from another member state. Since the early 1990s, U.S. nonproliferation programs have helped Russia and other former Soviet countries to, among other things, secure nuclear material and warheads, detect illicitly trafficked nuclear material, and eliminate excess stockpiles of weapons-usable nuclear material. However, these programs face a number of challenges which could compromise their ongoing effectiveness. For example, a lack of access to many sites in Russia's nuclear weapons complex has significantly impeded the Department of Energy's progress in helping Russia secure its nuclear material. U.S. radiation detection assistance efforts also face challenges, including corruption of some foreign border security officials, technical limitations of some radiation detection equipment, and inadequate maintenance of some equipment.",govreport
"Both mutual fund companies and banks are financial intermediaries, that is, they raise funds from savers and channel these funds back to the economy by investing them. Banks generally use their deposits either to make loans or to invest in certain debt securities, principally government bonds. Mutual funds do not make loans, but they do invest in securities, primarily bonds and stocks. Money from these funds, in turn, flows either directly (through primary securities markets) or indirectly (through secondary securities markets) to the issuers of such securities. Long before the recent mutual fund boom, the relative importance of bank loans as a source of finance had been declining. As early as the 1960s, some large businesses had been replacing their usage of bank loans by issuing short-term securities called commercial paper. Subsequently, more companies found ways to tap the securities markets for their financial needs, lessening their dependence on bank loans. For example, corporations’ reliance on bank loans as a percentage of their credit market debt declined from 28 percent in 1970 to 20 percent in 1994. The household sector (generally residential and consumer borrowers) also has become less dependent on bank loans for the ultimate source of financing. Beginning in the mid-1970s, and to a much greater extent since the early 1980s, major portions of home mortgage portfolios have been sold by banks and thrifts to financial intermediaries who use them as collateral for marketable securities and then sell the securities to investors. More recently, significant amounts of consumers’ credit card debt and automobile loans have been similarly financed by securities instead of bank credit. Through securitization, banks and thrifts provide the initial financing for these mortgage, credit card, and automobile loans. However, once the loans are sold, it is the securities market that is the ultimate source of financing. More broadly, the term securitization describes a process through which securities issuance supplants bank credit as a source of finance, even if the borrower originally received funds from a bank. In addition, the relative importance of bank loans has been further diminished by the increased provision of direct loans by nonbank financial intermediaries, including securities firms, insurance companies, and finance companies. In this report, discussion of the “impact of mutual funds on deposits” or of the “movement of money from deposits to mutual funds” refers not merely to direct withdrawal of deposits by customers for the sake of investing in mutual fund shares but also to customers’ diversion into mutual funds of new receipts that otherwise might have been placed in deposits. To assess the impact of mutual funds on deposits, we examined and compared available data published by industry sources and the bank regulators. Data on deposits in banks are routinely reported to and published by the bank regulators. Data on mutual funds are gathered and published by an industry association, the Investment Company Institute (ICI). Moreover, the Federal Reserve maintains and publishes the Flow of Funds Accounts, which is an attempt to capture the entire framework of financial transactions in the economy, including all major groupings of participants and instruments. This publication includes the bank data and mutual funds data that we used (the Federal Reserve obtains the mutual fund data from ICI). In the Flow of Funds Accounts, the Federal Reserve presents statistics on (1) the amounts outstanding at the end of each quarter and each year and (2) the net flows during each quarter and each year. For bank deposit information, the change of the level from one period to the next is used to determine the net flows into or out of deposits during that period. The same method is used for money market mutual funds, where the funds’ managers intend to maintain the value of a share constant at one dollar on a daily basis. For longer-term mutual funds, however, the period-to-period change in the fund’s value generally does not equal the net flows during the period because the value fluctuates with (1) the flows of customer money, (2) the changing prices of the stocks and bonds held by the mutual funds, and (3) the reinvestment of dividends and interest in the fund. In the Flow of Funds Accounts, the net flows into mutual funds are calculated from industry data on changes in amounts outstanding and adjusted for movements of security-price averages. To assess the impact of mutual funds’ growth on the total supply of loanable and investable funds, we examined the Flow of Funds Accounts data on the sources of finance for the economy. In addition, we did a literature search for research articles examining (1) how residential, consumer, and business borrowers obtain financing, not only from bank loans or securities issuance but also from other sources and (2) how lenders, including banks as well as nonbank providers such as finance companies, funded the financing they provided and whether they sold or securitized their finance. We supplemented our search of the statistical sources with other material. We used research articles published by the Federal Reserve and documents published by securities industry sources over the last 5 years. In addition, we interviewed Federal Reserve experts on the previously mentioned topics. We also drew upon information gathered from banks and mutual fund specialists who were interviewed for an ongoing related GAO assignment. The Federal Reserve provided written comments on a draft of this report. These comments are discussed on page 15. We did our review in Washington, D.C., from March 1994 to November 1994 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. The Federal Reserve and the Securities Industry Association (SIA) agreed that the flow of funds into mutual funds has had a significant impact on bank deposits. Although some observers dispute the magnitude of this impact, the evidence we reviewed supports the view that mutual funds have attracted sizable amounts of money that otherwise might have been placed in bank deposits. At year-end 1994, the amount of money in mutual funds ($2,172 billion) was considerably less than that in bank deposits ($3,462 billion). The mutual fund total, however, had risen by almost $1.2 trillion since year-end 1989, most of it from net new inflows, while the deposit total was $89 billion less than at year-end 1989. Despite these data, some observers maintain that deposits have not been a major source of the flow of money into mutual funds in recent years. For example, one study by a securities firm claims that “mutual fund inflows do not depend on outflows from the banking system,” arguing that “net new savings” are more important. ICI, a mutual funds industry association, stated that “CD proceeds play minor role as source for investment in stock and bond mutual funds,” and that “current income” and “the proceeds from other investments” were far more important. Nonetheless, most observers whose studies we reviewed agree that mutual funds have had a significant effect on bank deposits. Federal Reserve publications state that there has been a movement from deposits into mutual funds. The same view is propounded by SIA. Moreover, in a 1994 survey of 205 bank chief executives, nearly half said that their banks had started selling mutual funds in order to retain customers. We did not find any reliable quantification of the full impact of mutual funds on deposits, including both the direct withdrawals and customers’ diversion of new receipts that otherwise might have been placed in deposits. We assessed two quantitative approaches: (1) the total net flows into mutual funds and (2) ICI’s estimate of the impact on deposits. Because both approaches were incomplete, we examined a third alternative: the relationship between deposits and overall economic activity. This third approach also has limitations because there are a variety of factors that affect the relationship between deposits and gross domestic product (GDP). Nonetheless, it provided a more comprehensive look than the other approaches. Using the ratio of deposits to GDP as a benchmark, we estimated that—for the period 1990 through 1994—the total impact of mutual funds on deposits may have been sizable, but probably less than $700 billion. The total net flows into mutual funds from all sources during 1990 through 1994 were $1,067 billion. (See table 1.) The impact on deposits had to be less than this amount because the evidence indicated there were also flows into mutual funds from nondeposit sources. For example, some of the money placed in mutual funds by the household sector probably derived from the sales of stocks and bonds since, in 1991 and 1993, the household sector sold more individual securities than it bought. (See table 2.) Another possible source of flows into mutual funds was the frequent occurrence of sizable lump-sum distributions to individuals from retirement plans and job-termination arrangements. According to both the Federal Reserve and SIA, much of this money was placed in mutual funds by the recipients. SIA’s estimate of the impact of mutual funds on deposits was incomplete because it dealt only with the direct impact, i.e., the withdrawal of existing deposits for the sake of investing in mutual funds. Even this estimate of the direct impact was incomplete because it was primarily based on net withdrawals of banks’ time deposits, rather than total deposits. Using time deposits as a measure, SIA stated that the flow from deposits into mutual funds could have been about $200 billion in 1992 and 1993 combined. In fact, during this period declines in time deposits were largely offset by increases in demand deposits. Since there is no reporting of either the destinations of deposit withdrawals or of the origins of deposit placements, we cannot be certain whether time deposit withdrawals went into mutual funds or if part of them went into demand deposits. In any event, we found no estimates of the indirect effects, i.e., the diversion of new receipts into mutual funds rather than into deposits. Such a measure is more important in a growing economy because, even if deposits are growing, they may not be growing as fast as they would absent the diversion to mutual funds. We attempted to derive a reasonable estimate of the combined direct and indirect impact of mutual funds on deposits by examining the relationship of deposits to total economic activity, as measured by GDP. In figure 1, the solid line shows that the relationship of deposits to GDP remained fairly stable for most of the last 30 years. With only one exception, it stayed within a band of 63 percent to 73 percent every year from 1963 through 1990. Large flows into mutual funds in the 1980s (shown in figure 1 by the gap between the solid line and the dotted line) did not push the deposit-to-GDP ratio outside this band. However, in the early 1990s the deposit-to-GDP ratio moved significantly below the band, dropping to 51 percent in 1994. The ratio of mutual funds to GDP has been rising since the early 1980s, but only since the late 1980s has the rise in mutual funds-to-GDP ratio been roughly equal to the decline in the deposit-to-GDP ratio. This apparent substitution or movement of money into mutual funds rather than bank deposits has been, at least in part, the result of historically low interest rates paid on bank deposits compared to expected risk-adjusted returns on mutual fund investments. If the gap between deposit rates of return and expected mutual fund rates of return narrows, this movement of funds out of deposits could slow or even reverse itself. We calculated what the deposit volumes would have been had the deposit-to-GDP ratio stayed at the lower end of its previous band, i.e., 63 percent. Using this benchmark, total deposits would have grown $695 billion during 1990 through 1994. Because deposits actually declined by $89 billion, this indicates a potential impact of $784 billion. Comparing actual deposits with the low end of the previous band is conservative. A deposit-to-GDP ratio nearer the middle of the band would indicate a larger shortfall. Nonetheless, it must be stressed that the deposit-to-GDP ratio has been pushed down by a number of factors in addition to a movement of deposits into mutual funds. These factors include a dramatic downsizing of the savings-institution industry, a decline in loans at commercial banks, and a shift by banks into greater use of nondeposit funding sources. We were unable to determine exactly how much of the decline in the deposits-to-GDP ratio can be attributed to the impact of mutual funds. Nonetheless, on the basis of the above analysis, we concluded that a reasonable estimate of the impact was sizable but probably less than $700 billion. The movement of money from bank deposits to mutual funds should have little if any effect on the total supply of loanable and investable funds available to the economy, even though this movement may have shifted the intermediaries through which finance flows. Both types of intermediaries (banks and mutual fund companies) generally invest a substantial portion of the funds they receive. As noted earlier, the share of bank loans in total finance was being reduced by securitization of assets long before mutual funds surged to prominence as competitors for customers’ dollars. Mutual funds have further advanced this securitization process. Both mutual funds and banks generally invest a substantial portion of the funds they receive, with the mutual funds investing mainly in securities and the banks investing in loans and certain kinds of securities. Thus, at the same time that a sizable amount of customer money went from bank deposits to mutual funds, the funds’ purchases of securities became a greater source of new finance to the economy than bank lending. In 1992 and 1993, about two-fifths of the net new funds flowing to the domestic nonfinancial sectors of the economy came via mutual funds, while the share that flowed via banks was about one-fourth of the net new funds. By and large, it was not possible to determine who “receives” the mutual funds’ investments. Unlike bank lending, where the money goes directly from the lending bank to the borrower, mutual funds’ investments largely flow through the securities markets, since most of the funds’ purchases are of tradable securities. (A relatively small but interesting exception occurs with so-called “prime-rate” mutual funds, which purchase securitized bank loans.) As large amounts of customers’ money flowed into mutual funds in the early 1990s, the funds’ investments in securities added liquidity to the securities markets generally. This liquidity not only improved conditions for existing issuers desiring to raise additional money but also may have made it easier for a broader range of borrowers to tap the securities-issuance markets. Availability of finance for the three different borrower sectors—residential, consumer, and business—could be disproportionally affected by the movement of funds out of bank deposits and into mutual funds, even when the total supply of loanable and investable funds is not affected. Because mutual funds invest mainly in securities, it is possible that those who issue securities might increase their access to finance at the expense of those who do not. Unfortunately, there is no way to measure the extent to which this has occurred from the statistical information available. All three sectors obtain some of their financing through the securities markets, either through their own issues or via the intermediaries from which they obtain credit. Because significant amounts of finance flow through the latter intermediaries, we were unable to determine to what extent, or even whether, any of these sectors may face more difficulty in obtaining finance than they had previously experienced. However, we were able to determine that all three sectors increased their access to finance raised in the securities markets, although the degree varies by sector. In addition, we can describe the indirect channels through which securitization affects the availability of credit for these sectors, even though these indirect effects cannot be quantified. Residential finance has been extensively securitized. Although individual homeowners go to banks, thrifts, or mortgage companies for their mortgages, most residential mortgages are written in a way to facilitate their subsequent securitization. By the end of 1994, only 34 percent of the total value of home mortgages outstanding was directly held by commercial banks and thrifts, down from a two-thirds share in 1980 (see table 3). Nonetheless, banks and thrifts are now also providing indirect financing to homeowners: in addition to their (reduced) direct holdings of mortgages, they invest in mortgage-backed securities. Consumer credit is still largely provided by commercial banks. As of year-end 1994, 63 percent of consumer debt (nonmortgage) was held by depository institutions. Banks continue to actively originate consumer credit. Since the late 1980s, however, banks and other providers of consumer finance have securitized some of their automobile loans and credit card receivables, resulting in the securitized portion of consumer debt rising from zero in 1985 to 14 percent in 1994. (See table 4.) Moreover, consumers have another avenue of indirect access to the securities markets: borrowing from finance companies. These companies obtain two-thirds of their funds by issuing their own securities. We examined the supply of finance to the corporate sector for the years 1990 through 1994, when the greatest inflow into mutual funds occurred and when deposit growth was small or negative. During the first 4 years of this period, the amount of outstanding bank credit to nonfinancial corporations declined every year. (See table 5.) Not all corporations reduced their bank loans, of course, but the declines outweighed the increases. In 1994, for the first time during this period, there was an increase in outstanding bank credit to nonfinancial corporations. In the first year of this period, 1990, the corporate sector did not offset declining bank loans by increased issuance of securities. In fact, the sector redeemed more securities than it issued. Thereafter, however, corporations far surpassed previous records for raising new funds on the securities markets. Net issuance averaged $100 billion annually in 1991 through 1993, compared with a previous single-year record of $55 billion. In 1994 there was a sharp falloff of net securities issuance by the corporate sector along with renewed growth in bank loans. The flow of liquidity from mutual funds into the securities markets enhanced the capacity of the securities markets to absorb these new issues. From 1990 through 1994, mutual funds made net purchases of corporate securities averaging $104 billion annually. Mutual funds not only purchased the securities of large corporations. They also were major purchasers of shares of smaller companies issuing stock for the first time as well as major purchasers of bonds issued by companies whose debt was not highly rated (so-called junk bonds). For those business borrowers who are unable to issue securities, there are indirect ways in which funding from the securities markets can flow to them. For example, just as finance companies channel funds from the securities markets to consumers, it is common for finance companies to lend to middle-sized companies that otherwise would borrow from banks. Even in the “noncorporate, nonfarm business sector,” where the borrowers tend to be quite small, finance companies supply about a fifth of total market debt. As another example, some business financing is funded by certain mutual funds that invest primarily in business loans bought from the originating banks. There is a possibility that those small businesses that are primarily dependent on small banks for their loans could experience reduced credit availability if their banks lost deposits to mutual funds. This could happen if neither these businesses nor their banks could readily obtain financing from other credit suppliers or from the capital markets. Available evidence shows that small businesses are more dependent on bank loans than large businesses. Whereas bank loans comprise about one-eighth of the debt of the corporate sector as a whole, a 1989 survey cited by the Federal Reserve suggested that small businesses get almost half of their debt financing from banks. Nonetheless, by implication, the average small business gets about half of its debt financing from nonbank sources. Some small businesses raise money by issuing securities. According to the Federal Reserve, many of these firms probably benefitted from the more receptive conditions in the markets in recent years. However, small businesses with less than $100 million in annual sales generally would not be able to sell securities. Nonetheless, small businesses can be indirect beneficiaries of mutual funds’ investments, via the securities issued by finance companies that extend credit to small businesses. As another conduit, one securities firm has extended about $1 billion in credit lines to small businesses. Regarding the access of small businesses to bank loans, the movement of money out of deposits and into mutual funds does not necessarily mean that the availability of bank loans will be reduced. If the lenders are regional banks or larger, they may be losing some of their loan volume to securitization either because they are securitizing their own assets or because their corporate customers are turning to securities issuance. In this case, more of the remaining deposits of these banks should be available for lending to small businesses. Nonetheless, presumably there is some portion of small businesses that is solely or heavily dependent on small banks for their credit. These borrowers might be affected if their banks lose deposits to mutual funds. Because some small banks’ borrower base is concentrated in small business, their clientele is not likely to reduce loans by switching to securities issuance. Thus, a cutback of these banks’ funding sources would probably not be accompanied by a reduction of loan demand. Therefore, some small banks might have to respond to a loss of deposits by cutting back on loans outstanding. However, such cutbacks are only a hypothetical possibility. Recently, banks with $250 million or less in assets have had ample liquidity in the form of their holdings of bonds and other securities in their investment accounts. The ratio of securities to total assets averaged over 33 percent in 1993 and 1994 compared with an average of about 28 percent for much of the 1980s. If faced with a loss of deposits, a number of small banks presumably could fund existing and new loans by selling these securities. In sum, the channels of financing are quite varied; for the most part, a shift of customers’ money from deposits into mutual funds need not reduce credit availability for any group of borrowers. There remains the possibility that some borrowers from small banks might face credit availability constraints in certain circumstances, but it is not clear whether those circumstances currently exist. We received written comments on a draft of this report from the Federal Reserve. In its letter, the Federal Reserve stated that the report provides a timely review of the flow of funds between mutual funds and bank deposits and the effect of these flows on credit availability. The Federal Reserve said it had no further comment regarding the report or its content because the report made no recommendations to the Federal Reserve.

GAO found that: (1) the amount of money in mutual funds grew from $994 billion at year-end 1989 to $2,172 billion at year-end 1994, mainly due to an increase of net customer inflows; (2) during the same period, bank deposits declined from $3.55 billion to $3.46 billion; (3) as much as $700 billion of the growth in mutual funds may have come at the expense of bank deposits between 1990 and 1994; (4) the movement of money into mutual funds has resulted partly from the relatively lower interest rates paid on bank deposits, but this should have little effect on the total supply of loanable and investable funds, since mutual funds also lend or invest a major portion of the funds they receive; (5) there was insufficient data on whether the different categories of borrowers were affected by the shift of money from bank deposits to mutual funds; (6) all categories of borrowers have recently increased their access to financing obtained through the securities markets; and (7) flows of deposits out of smaller banks could reduce the availability of finance for small businesses whose primary source of finance is loans from such banks.",govreport
"By the late 1970s, the First City Bancorporation of Texas, Inc., through its subsidiary banks, had a high concentration of loans to the energy industry in the Southwest United States and was regarded as a principal lender in that industry. In the early and mid-1980s, when the energy industry experienced financial difficulties, so did First City. By 1986, First City was reporting operating losses. First City, its regulators, and FDIC recognized that many of the subsidiary banks could not survive without major infusions of capital. These parties agreed that the capital needed for long-term viability could not come wholly from the private sector due to the financially strained condition of the Southwest’s economy and banking industry. A chronology of events leading to FDIC’s open bank assistance in 1988 and the final resolution of the First City banks in 1993 appears below. A description of changes in various legal authorities over the same period, 1987 to 1993, is contained in appendix II. After considering available alternatives, FDIC and First City entered into a recapitalization agreement—commonly referred to as open bank assistance—that called for First City to reduce its subsidiary banks from nearly 60 to about 20. The agreement also required the creation of a “collecting bank” to dispose of certain troubled assets held by the subsidiary banks. The open bank assistance included a $970 million capital infusion from FDIC along with $500 million of private capital raised by the new bank management to restore First City’s financial health. As part of the agreement, FDIC received $970 million in preferred stock of the collecting bank. FDIC also received a guarantee, from both First City Bancorporation and the subsidiary banks, for $100 million payable in 1998 toward the retirement of the collecting bank preferred stock. The recapitalized First City banks embarked on a short-lived aggressive growth policy that resulted in First City banks’ assets increasing from about $10.9 billion as of April 19, 1988, to about $13.9 billion as of September 30, 1990. First City banks’ loan portfolios included high-risk loans, such as loans to finance highly leveraged transactions, international loans, and out-of-territory lending. During this period, First City reported $183 million in profits and paid $122 million in cash dividends. In part, the earnings used to justify the cash dividends were profits that depended on income from nontraditional and onetime sources, such as the sale of its credit card operations. By September 1990, problems with the quality of its loan portfolios not only caused operating losses but also started to erode First City’s capital. A 1990 OCC examination report strongly criticized the lending practices of First City’s lead bank, First City-Houston. Some of its loan losses resulted from continued deterioration in loans made before April 1988. However, other losses were attributed to new loans associated with an aggressive risk-taking posture by new management combined with poor underwriting practices. During and immediately after OCC’s 1990 examination, First City made changes in the lead bank’s senior executive management, and OCC entered into formal supervisory agreements with First City’s Houston, Austin, and San Antonio banks. The agreements required each of the banks to achieve and maintain adequate levels of capital. They also required improvements in (1) underwriting standards, (2) bank management and board oversight, (3) strategic planning, (4) budgeting, (5) capital and dividend policies, (6) management of troubled assets, (7) internal loan review, (8) allowance for loan and lease losses (ALLL), (9) lending activities, and (10) loan administration and appraisals. According to OCC, First City bank management complied with substantially all of the provisions of the formal agreements, except the capital maintenance provisions. While First City significantly strengthened its underwriting criteria, reduced its aggressive high-risk lending practices, and initiated actions to recapitalize, these efforts did not prevent the First City banks from failing. Between September 30, 1990, and October 30, 1992, problems in the loan portfolios continued to mount. First City bank assets decreased from about $13.9 billion to about $8 billion, and First City incurred total losses of about $625 million. Most of the post-recapitalization losses were from loans at First City’s lead bank in Houston and its second-largest bank in Dallas. Among the primary reasons for the banks’ financial difficulties were the continued decline in the Texas economy, weaker-than-anticipated loan portfolios in the recapitalized banks, questionable lending activity by First City management within the first 2 years of the recapitalization, and high bank operating expenses. OCC, as primary federal bank regulator for the lead bank, projected in early 1991 that operating losses would deplete the capital of this bank by year-end 1992. Later, on the basis of First City’s operating results, OCC projected that by the end of 1992 bank losses would either (1) deplete the capital at the Houston bank and cause its insolvency or (2) erode the bank’s capital to less than 2 percent of its assets, in which case OCC had the authority to close the bank effective December 19, 1992, in accordance with the prompt corrective action provisions of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 (FDICIA). The Federal Reserve System (FRS)—the primary federal bank regulator for the Dallas bank—also projected its likely insolvency by the end of 1992. Under the cross-guarantee provisions of the Financial Institution Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act of 1989 (FIRREA), FDIC could require the 18 otherwise solvent First City banks to reimburse FDIC for any anticipated losses resulting from the failures of the Houston and Dallas banks. FDIC staff advised the FDIC Board that the capital of the 18 banks would not be sufficient to cover the projected losses from the 2 insolvent banks, and the application of the cross-guarantee provision could result in the insolvency of all 20 First City banks. OCC, FDIC, and the Texas Banking Commissioner closely monitored the First City banks following the recapitalization, and along with FRS, shared information concerning the Houston and Dallas banks’ deteriorating financial conditions. Following its September 1991 and January 1992 examinations of First City-Houston, OCC advised First City that its future viability could not be ensured without a significant capital infusion. Similarly, FRS examination of the holding company in 1991 found that First City lacked adequate capital to support its network of subsidiary banks. Beginning in June 1991, representatives of OCC began working with their counterparts at FDIC on a plan for early intervention and resolution of First City-Houston. These efforts were intense and ongoing throughout 1991 and into 1992. During 1991 and 1992, First City, OCC, and FDIC considered a number of alternative resolution plans. The resolution plans considered by First City involved three types of transactions: (1) Type A—Acquisition of First City banks by a stronger, well-capitalized banking company. (2) Type B—Major capital infusion by an outside investor or investor groups. (3) Type C—A self-rescue by the banking organization through some combination of consolidation or sale of subsidiary banks, new capital, and FDIC concessions and financial support. Initially, First City favored a Type B transaction and indentified a number of potential investors as possible sources of significant new capital. However, in anticipation that raising new capital would be extremely difficult given the banking organization’s precarious financial position and continuing OCC concerns with bank management, First City did not actively pursue a Type B transaction. Thereafter, it pursued a Type A transaction almost exclusively. In October 1991, OCC, FDIC, and First City developed a proposal (Type A transaction) that called for the banks’ acquisition by a stronger institution, with the possible need for FDIC financial assistance. In late 1991, FDIC’s Division of Resolutions (DOR) staff contacted a number of banking organizations to assess their interest in acquiring the First City banks. While a number of institutions expressed considerable interest in the First City banks and conducted in-depth reviews of bank operations, only one institution ultimately submitted a bid. DOR staff recommended that the bid be rejected for a number of reasons, including its estimated $240 million cost to FDIC, which was higher than FDIC’s estimate of $179 million to liquidate the banks at that time. DOR staff also asserted that the proposal was not in the best interest of FDIC because it contained several items that were difficult to quantify and would require costly negotiations with the acquirer. DOR staff asserted that these negotiations could significantly delay completion of any open bank assistance until after December 1992, when FDIC projected the banks would become insolvent. After the Type A transaction for open bank assistance was rejected by FDIC, First City developed two new self-rescue proposals (Type C) to recapitalize the troubled banks. In July 1992, First City submitted its first self-rescue plan, which called for the closure and immediate reopening of four of the largest First City banks under the control of an acquiring bank. Under this proposal, the acquiring bank would purchase about $7.5 billion of First City banks’ performing and fixed assets, and FDIC would enter into a loss-sharing agreement with the acquiring bank for the remaining $1.2 billion of troubled assets. DOR staff recommended this alternative be pursued because they estimated no losses to BIF. According to the staff’s projections, a combination of the financial commitments made by the acquiring bank and the ALLL previously established by First City banks could absorb additional deterioration that might occur in the quality of the loan portfolios. However, the FDIC Board was concerned about the ability of First City bank management to execute the proposal. In August 1992, the FDIC Board rejected the proposal mainly because of a condition in the plan that required FDIC to guarantee payment in full for all deposits, including uninsured deposits. In August 1992, First City management submitted another self-rescue proposal to OCC to recapitalize the banks. This proposal called for First City to merge its four largest banks—Houston, Dallas, Austin, and San Antonio. This plan also called for 13 of the remaining 16 First City banks to be sold for an estimated $200 million. An additional $100 million in new equity capital would be raised through a stock offering to new investors and current shareholders. Approximately $96 million would be raised through cost savings from proposed renegotiation of long-term leases. Finally, the proposal would have required FDIC to make concessions totaling over $100 million—stemming largely from the 1988 open bank assistance. The plan projected that the reconstituted and recapitalized First City banks would work their way back to profitability. According to First City documents, it had received commitments from potential investors and landlords needed to raise more than $300 million in capital. OCC’s analysis of First City’s August self-rescue proposal concluded that the plan lacked viability due to an estimated $200 million capital shortfall at the reconstituted banks. OCC concluded that the plan did not provide sufficient incoming capital to cover asset quality problems and to provide the capital base required to reestablish the banks for long-term viability. OCC documents also showed that the planned lease renegotiations would not result in the projected savings. Finally, OCC also believed that First City would not be able to raise sufficient capital through stock issuances. Shortly after receipt of First City’s August 1992 self-rescue plan, OCC determined that an up-to-date examination was necessary to evaluate the likelihood that the plan would result in long-term viability for First City. The examination of the Houston bank, which began in late August 1992, focused on problem loans. OCC noted significant deterioration in several large loans since its last examination. On the basis of the results of its August examination, OCC determined that the bank had underestimated its ALLL by about $67 million. This amount exceeded the Houston bank’s existing equity capital of about $28 million, thus making the Houston bank insolvent and requiring OCC to close it. The Examiner-In-Charge (EIC) and other OCC officials told us that their adjustment of ALLL was based on both objective and subjective considerations. They said they gave consideration to First City-Houston’s history relating to its management’s inadequate recognition of loan quality problems and provision for ALLL. The OCC officials said they were also concerned about deteriorating financial conditions at the bank as reflected in dangerous classification trends within its loan portfolio, whereby a higher percentage of loans were recognized as troubled loans and the bank had not experienced the same recovery pattern as experienced by most banks. Further, OCC officials said they were concerned about the bank’s financial condition relative to other comparable institutions. In comparing First City’s ALLL to that of peer institutions, OCC said that it found that First City had maintained an ALLL level far below that of its peers. OCC said that given First City’s asset problems, it believed that First City’s ALLL should have been far higher than the peer average. OCC officials said they were also concerned about the weakening economic conditions in Texas and First City’s ability to overcome its problems in this environment. Finally, OCC officials said that, by this time, they had lost confidence in First City’s management and its processes for establishing proper reserve levels. On October 16, 1992, OCC advised FDIC of its latest examination findings and its plans to close First City-Houston as soon as practicable so that FDIC could resolve it in an orderly manner. FDIC advised OCC that FDIC could accelerate its projected December 1992 resolution to October 30, 1992, in light of the OCC examination findings. Accordingly, on October 30, 1992, OCC declared the First City-Houston bank insolvent and appointed FDIC receiver. On that same day, the Texas Banking Commissioner closed First City-Dallas on the grounds of imminent insolvency, and FDIC exercised its statutory authority to issue immediately payable cross-guarantee demands on the remaining 18 First City banks. This resulted in the closure of the entire First City banking organization on October 30, 1992. After being advised of OCC’s examination findings, FDIC considered two basic alternatives to provide for the orderly resolution of the First City banks: (1) liquidate them immediately or (2) place them under FDIC control and operate them as bridge banks until a sale could be arranged. FDIC chose the latter alternative, which would provide time for FDIC to compare the cost of liquidation to the cost of selling the banks based on bids it planned to solicit after the banks failed. FDIC assumed potential acquirers would be interested in purchasing the banks only if FDIC removed certain risks associated with asset quality problems, potential litigation liabilities, and costly contractual obligations. The January 1993 sale attracted bids from 30 potential acquirers and resulted in the sale of all 20 of the bridge banks. At the time of sale, FDIC estimated the sale would result in a gain, or surplus, of about $60 million—substantially different from the $500 million loss that FDIC had estimated 3 months earlier. FDIC officials said they were astonished by the proceeds. After resolution and liquidation expenses are paid, FDIC is to return any surplus to First City creditors and shareholders. Shortly after the First City banks were closed, the holding company filed lawsuits on behalf of the shareholders. The lawsuits asserted, among other things, that federal and state banking regulators acted without regard to due process and illegally and unnecessarily closed a solvent banking organization. More specifically, the lawsuits allege that OCC wrongfully closed the lead national bank and that the Texas Banking Commissioner wrongfully closed First City-Dallas. The lawsuits also asserted that FDIC, as the insurer, was responsible for the inappropriate closure of the financially sound First City banks. According to the suit, FDIC used its cross-guarantee authorities to execute the agency’s preconceived plan to gain control of the First City banking organization. The holding company asserted that FDIC’s use of its cross-guarantee provisions was both inappropriate and unnecessary, and violated the Fifth Amendment of the Constitution. The suit also noted that on numerous occasions during the summer of 1992, First City Bancorporation offered to merge all the First City banks and restore the capital at the troubled banks. The holding company asserted that if the regulators had approved such an action, their plans to close the First City banks could not have been carried out. In 1988, FDIC could have waited until the First City banks were insolvent and either liquidated them or sold them to interested potential acquirers. However, FDIC determined that providing $970 million in assistance to the First City banks was the best alternative available. When FDIC approved First City’s open bank assistance, FDIC’s resolution alternatives were limited by both regulatory requirements and economic conditions. In April 1988, OCC could not have closed First City banks for insolvency because, at that time, OCC could close a bank for insolvency only when a bank’s primary capital was negative. At the time, a bank’s primary capital was defined by OCC as the sum of the bank’s retained earnings and the bank’s ALLL. Although First City had negative retained earnings of $625 million, it also had $730 million in ALLL; hence, it had positive primary capital of $105 million. Additionally, in the mid-1980s, the Texas banking industry was experiencing its worst economic performance since the Great Depression, which limited FDIC’s resolution alternatives. According to FDIC, the economic conditions increased the cost to liquidate troubled banks and reduced the number of potential acquirers. Consequently, FDIC considered two resolution alternatives in August 1987. One was to allow First City losses to continue to mount until the banks’ primary capital was depleted, then either liquidate or operate First City banks as bridge banks until potential acquirers could be found. Under the other alternative, FDIC could have provided open bank assistance to willing acquirers of the First City banks—as long as the estimated cost of assistance was less than the estimated cost of liquidation to the insurance fund. FDIC decided against the first alternative for three reasons. First, FDIC believed that allowing First City banks to continue to deteriorate could jeopardize the stability of the regional banking industry. FDIC also was unsure about operating First City as a bridge bank because bridge banks were new to FDIC (the agency had received bridge bank authority in August 1987). Second, the First City banks were far too large and complex to be the agency’s first bridge banks, in FDIC’s opinion. And third, FDIC rejected liquidation because estimated liquidation costs were determined to be higher than the estimated cost to the fund for open bank assistance. FDIC approved $970 million of open bank assistance as the best resolution alternative available. A total of eight parties expressed interest in acquiring the troubled banks, and three submitted bids. FDIC’s estimates of potential insurance fund commitments based on those bids ranged from the $970 million for open bank assistance to $1.8 billion for the bid most costly to the insurance fund. According to FDIC records, one of the bids led to estimated fund costs as low as $603 million, but FDIC found that the bidder had used overly optimistic assumptions in the offer. When adjusted, the insurance fund cost of that bid was nearly $1.3 billion. The Federal Reserve Board (FRB) approved the change of control of these recapitalized banks to the new First City bank management with reservations. FRB’s memo approving the change of control warned the new management that assumptions agreed upon by FDIC and First City and used to forecast the banks’ road to recovery were optimistic. It also warned that if regional economic conditions did not drastically improve, the recapitalization effort was not likely to succeed. We reviewed the First City banks’ performance following the recapitalization to identify the factors that contributed to the October 1992 failures. We found that the failures resulted from a combination of factors, including the payment of dividends to shareholders, deteriorating loan portfolios, and relatively high operating costs. These findings are described in appendix III. On October 28, 1992, the FDIC Board determined that placing the failed First City banks into interim bridge banks constituted the least costly and most orderly resolution to First City’s financial difficulties. On that date the FDIC Board considered three alternatives. Two involved bridge bank resolutions and the third called for a liquidation of First City banks’ assets. The difference between the two bridge bank alternatives was that one alternative contained a loss-sharing agreement on a selected pool of troubled assets. Under this agreement, the acquirer would manage and dispose of the asset pool, and FDIC would reimburse the acquirer for a portion of the losses incurred when selling those assets. The other bridge bank alternative did not provide for loss sharing. The purpose of the two bridge bank alternatives was to provide for an orderly resolution by continuing the business of the banks until acceptable acquirers could be found. FDIC’s belief was that the bridge banks would preserve the First City banks’ value as going concerns while FDIC marketed them. FDIC estimated that a bridge bank resolution would minimize BIF’sfinancial exposure. FDIC was aware of various parties’ interest in acquiring the banks. However, FDIC believed that the potential acquirers would be interested in the banks only after they were placed in receivership, since, after closure, new bank management could renegotiate contractual and deposit arrangements with bank servicers and customers. FDIC staff estimated resolution costs to BIF ranging from a low of about $700 million (bridge bank with loss sharing) to a high of over $1 billion (FDIC liquidation). FDIC estimated both bridge bank alternatives to be less costly than a liquidation primarily because of the likelihood that FDIC would be able to obtain a premium, or a cash payment, from potential acquirers who would be assuming the deposits of the bridge banks. In a liquidation, no such premium would be paid because FDIC pays the depositors directly instead of selling the right to assume the deposits to an acquirer. FDIC also estimated that it could minimize the losses to the insurance fund if it provided loss sharing. While the FDIC Board believed that a bridge bank with a loss-sharing arrangement was the most orderly and least costly alternative presented by DOR, the ultimate cost of resolving the First City banks was uncertain. DOR staff’s initial cost model, which was based on the estimated proceeds and costs of each resolution alternative, estimated that a bridge bank resolution with loss sharing would cost about $700 million. This estimate was based largely on an asset valuation review performed for DOR by an outside contractor. Representatives from FDIC’s Division of Liquidations (DOL), which was responsible for disposing of assets assumed by FDIC, said that liquidating the First City banks would likely cost more than $1 billion. Other FDIC officials—including senior level DOR officials—said that because of the considerable market interest in the banks on a closed-bank basis, the cost to resolve First City banks would likely be about $300 million. The Board determined that placing First City banks into interim bridge banks would cost the insurance fund about $500 million. The then DOR Director told us that the fact that the Board did not rely solely on the initial DOR cost model was not a deviation from the normal resolution process. He explained to us that the resolution process is dynamic and takes into account FDIC Board deliberations. He noted that it was his responsibility to advise the Board regarding the merits and shortfalls associated with the DOR asset valuation process. He pointed out that DOR’s asset valuations estimated the net realizable value for failed bank assets disposed of by FDIC through a liquidation. The methodology determining net realizable value of assets may not always reflect the market value of assets disposed of through such resolution alternatives as an interim bridge bank. Typically, a going concern (including a bridge bank) establishes asset values that attempt to maximize the return to the investor regardless of the period the assets may be held. Net realizable asset valuation in a liquidation, on the other hand, attempts to maximize the return to the investor given a limited holding period, often less than 2 years. According to FDIC documents used in its Board’s deliberations, the October 1992 decision to place the First City banks in bridge banks and commit about $500 million to resolve First City was the least costly of the three alternatives the FDIC Board formally considered when the banks were closed. During the year preceding the failure, FDIC and OCC considered and rejected a number of alternatives to resolve the First City banks because the alternatives were considered too costly, did not ensure the banks’ long-term viability, or included provisions that were unacceptable from a policy perspective. As previously discussed, OCC had projected that operating losses, caused by imbedded loan portfolio problems, would render First City banks insolvent by December 1992. However, OCC’s determination that the Houston bank was insolvent in October 1992 accelerated First City banks’ closure by about 2 months. FDIC officials believed the earlier than projected closure unintentionally but effectively precluded either previous or new potential acquirers from doing due diligence, i.e., determining the value of the bank assets, deposits, and other liabilities necessary to ascertain their interest in bidding on the First City banks at the time of closure. Although FDIC initially estimated the cost to BIF of the October 1992 resolution of First City banks to be $500 million, the agency has since projected that this resolution will result in no cost to BIF. When it announced the sale of the First City banks in January 1993, FDIC estimated the proceeds generated from the sale would amount to a surplus of about $60 million. In June 1994, FDIC estimated that the surplus may exceed $200 million. As mentioned earlier, any surplus remaining after payment of FDIC’s resolution expenses is to be returned to First City’s creditors and shareholders. According to FDIC’s analysis of the resolution, sales proceeds were higher than FDIC expected largely because acquirers paid a 17-percent premium for the banks—substantially more than the 1-percent premium on deposits that FDIC had estimated in arriving at the $500 million loss estimate. According to FDIC officials, a deposit premium of 1 percent was typical for failed bank resolutions contemporaneous with the 1992 First City bank resolution. Some FDIC officials, however, told us that at least part of the premium paid by the acquirers should be attributed to the value the acquirers placed on First City bank assets. Since acquirers do not specify in their bids how much they are willing to pay for assets or deposits, neither we nor FDIC can determine the exact basis for the premium. As of June 1994, FDIC projected that settlement of the lawsuits by First City Bancorporation would result in no cost to BIF. FDIC’s projection was based on the assumption that the estimated surplus from the bridge bank sale will exceed its costs to resolve and liquidate the bridge banks, with any excess ultimately to be paid to the holding company. On June 22, 1994, FDIC and the holding company signed a settlement agreement under which First City would immediately receive in excess of $200 million. The settlement would allow the First City Bancorporation to pay its creditors and permit a distribution to its shareholders sooner rather than later.Basic tenets of this proposed settlement are (1) BIF will incur no loss in connection with the 1992 resolution of the First City banks and (2) FDIC will not receive more than its out-of-pocket costs to resolve the banks. Consistent with these tenets, the proposed settlement provides for FDIC to receive the net present value of over $100 million, largely based on First City’s guarantee to pay in 1998 toward the retirement of the collecting-bank-preferred-stock FDIC received in return for the 1988 open bank assistance. Any settlement between the two parties cannot be consummated until it is approved by the bankruptcy court. FDIC officials anticipate a decision on the settlement in early 1995. Generally, the processes used in providing financial assistance, closing banks, and resolving troubled banks should always include adequate safeguards for BIF. The events surrounding the First City resolutions offer valuable lessons for FDIC as the insurer and for all of the primary bank regulators. These lessons relate to how to better assist, close, or otherwise resolve troubled institutions in the future. Consultation between regulatory agencies might have led FDIC to adopt more realistic assumptions concerning the likelihood of success of the $970 million open bank assistance provided First City in 1988. When FDIC and the new First City management forecasted the First City banks’ success in 1988, a key economic assumption was that the economies of Texas and the Southwest would reverse their recessionary trend and grow at about 3 percent per year to mirror the growth rate of the national economy during the mid-1980s. However, the Texas economy grew only an average of 2.2 percent per year between 1989 and 1991. Furthermore, by the late 1980s and early 1990s, the national economy, which had been growing at about 3 percent per year, started to weaken and experience its own recessionary conditions. While approving the change of control to the new First City bank management, FRB raised a concern about these economic assumptions being too optimistic and, if not realized, possibly jeopardizing the success of the recapitalized banks. If FDIC had consulted with its regulatory counterparts in FRS and OCC on economic and financial assumptions for the economy and market in which the assisted bank would operate, it would have had a broader base for, and greater confidence in, the economic assumptions used as a basis to approve the open bank assistance. Such consultation might have produced more realistic assumptions and a better understanding of the likelihood that the financial assistance that FDIC provided could be successful. The financial assistance agreement could have included safeguards to better ensure that First City undertook only those operations that were within its capabilities and capacities. At the time of the open bank assistance, the new management of the First City bank projected relatively modest growth, primarily in traditional consumer lending activities. However, under pressure to generate a return for its investors through earnings and dividends, the management pursued much riskier lending and investment activities than it had described in its reorganization prospectus. In addition to taking more risks, the new bank management did not have the expertise, policies, or procedures in place to adequately control these activities. Further, the new bank management entered into contractual arrangements based on projected growth that, when not realized, resulted in higher operating expenses than the bank could sustain. FDIC’s assistance agreement did not include sufficient safeguards to ensure that the new bank management actually pursued a business strategy comparable to the one agreed upon as being prudent, or that the bank’s activities were in line with management’s capabilities or the bank’s capacities. In retrospect, such safeguards could have been specified in the agreement. For example, according to the reorganization prospectus, First City projected that it would expand its overall loan portfolio an average of about 10 percent per year for the first 3 years after the recapitalization. The new bank management projected that consumer, credit card, and energy loans would grow at significantly higher rates than the overall loan portfolio. Management also projected little growth in the riskier areas of real estate and international lending. Contrary to those projections, overall lending activity grew by only about 3 percent in 1989 and actually declined by about 3 percent in 1990 and by over 31 percent in 1991. First City sold its credit card portfolio in early 1990. In addition, First City’s actual real estate and international loans accounted for far greater percentages of its total loan portfolio than projected in the 1988 prospectus. FDIC’s financial assistance agreement with First City did not contain provisions requiring First City’s management to develop specific business strategies reflecting safe and sound banking practices and internal control mechanisms safeguarding FDIC’s investment in the First City banks. Shortly after the recapitalization, OCC examiners criticized the management of First City’s Houston bank for not having established policies and procedures to manage the risk associated with the bank’s highly leveraged transaction loans. Consequently, OCC directed the bank to establish policies and procedures to minimize the risks of those transactions. OCC similarly directed the bank management to establish policies and procedures related to the Houston bank’s international lending activities. In the meantime, First City bank management paid dividends based on income derived from its lending activity as well as from extraordinary events, such as the sale of its credit card operations. While such payments were permissible under the law at the time, they did not help the bank retain needed capital. Consequently, First City banks lacked sufficient capital to absorb the losses stemming from their lending activities. Further, First City-Houston entered into long-term contractual arrangements for buildings and services, such as data processing, that were based on overly optimistic projections of future growth. When that growth was not realized, the overhead costs related to these arrangements proved to be a drain on earnings and contributed to the bank’s failure. FDIC would have been in a better position to avoid the risks associated with these banking practices if it had strengthened the open assistance agreement by including provisions to (1) require bank management to develop business strategies relative to its market, expertise, and operational capabilities; and (2) control the flow of funds out of the bank through dividends, contractual arrangements, and other activities, such as management fees paid to the holding company or affiliates. The provisions could have been structured so that the primary regulator held bank management accountable for compliance with them. Such a structure could have involved having bank management stipulate that it would comply with specific assistance agreement provisions. Such a stipulation would have allowed the primary regulator to monitor the bank’s adherence to the key provisions of the assistance agreement, including the development of specific business strategies and lending policies and procedures. The primary regulator would then have had the information and authority necessary to take the appropriate enforcement action to ensure compliance with the key provisions of the agreement. Banks are required to follow statutory limitations on dividend payments provided in 12 U.S.C. §§ 56 and 60. While the regulations implementing the statutes and governing the payment of dividends have been tightened since 1988, banks are still authorized to pay dividends, as long as they satisfy the FDICIA minimum capital requirements. FDIC could have better controlled the flow of funds from the assisted banks by either limiting dividend payments or requiring regulatory approval based on the source of dividends. Such controls are typically used by FDIC and other regulators in enforcement actions when they have reason to be concerned about the safety and soundness of a bank’s practices or condition, and they could have been used in a similar manner in the First City assistance agreement. OCC could have better documented the bases for its closure decision had its examination reports and workpapers been clear, complete, and self-explanatory. Congress authorized the Comptroller of the Currency, as the charterer of national banks, to close a national bank whenever one or more statutorily prescribed grounds are found to exist, including insolvency. It is generally agreed in the regulatory community that closure decisions should be supported by clear, well-documented evidence of the grounds for closure. Thus, OCC and other primary regulators’ bank examination reports and underlying workpapers supporting closure decisions need to be complete, current, and accurate and provide documentation of the bases for closure decisions that is self-explanatory. However, we were unable to determine the basis for the OCC examiners’ finding that First City-Houston’s ALLL was insufficient solely from our review of the examination report or workpapers. Specifically, the examination report that OCC conveyed to Houston bank management did not fully articulate the basis for OCC’s finding that the bank’s ALLL was inadequate. From our review of OCC’s workpapers, we were unable to reconstruct the analysis performed to arrive at the need to increase the Houston bank’s ALLL. We had to supplement the information in the working papers with additional information obtained through discussions with the EIC and senior level OCC officials in order to determine how OCC arrived at its decision to require First City-Houston to increase its ALLL by $67 million. OCC officials were able to provide additional clarifying information on the basis for this finding. Although some information regarding these concerns was included in the examination workpapers, it was not sufficient for us to independently follow how OCC’s examiners arrived at the basis for their conclusion that First City-Houston’s ALLL was insufficient. Thoroughly documented workpapers would also have provided OCC and FDIC with a clear trail of the examiners’ methodology, analytical bases of evidentiary support, and mathematical calculations. This would have precluded the need for resource expenditures to reconstruct or verify the basis for examiners’ conclusions. Workpapers are important as support for the information and conclusions contained in the related report of examination. As described in OCC’s examination guidance, the primary purposes of the workpapers include (1) organizing the material assembled during an examination to facilitate review and future reference, (2) documenting the results of testing and formalizing the examiner’s conclusions, and (3) substantiating the assertions of fact or opinions contained in the report of examination. When examination reports and workpapers are clear and concise, independent reviewers, including those affected by the results, should be able to understand the basis for the conclusions reached by the examiner. OCC officials agreed that the First City examination workpapers should have included a comprehensive summary of the factors considered in reaching the final examination conclusions, especially regarding such a critical issue as a determination of bank insolvency. FDIC’s DOR could have considered information from the primary regulator relative to asset quality in making its resolution decisions. In situations like First City, where the primary regulator had just extensively reviewed a high proportion of the loan portfolio as part of a comprehensive examination and found deficiencies in the bank’s loan classification and reserving processes, FDIC resolutions officials should have been able to utilize the examination findings, at least as a secondary source, to test their asset valuation assumptions. This would have been particularly useful because the failure came on short notice and some FDIC officials had reservations about some of the underlying assumptions. OCC examination officials were apparently communicating with their FDIC examination counterparts about the accelerated First City-Houston bank examination. Even so, FDIC’s DOR officials could have benefitted from earlier information on OCC’s preliminary findings that indicated that First City-Houston would be insolvent before December 1992, as had been anticipated by all affected parties. This information would have provided DOR more lead time to consider a wider range of resolution alternatives, including soliciting bids from parties it knew to be interested in acquiring the banks. FDIC officials, however, did not believe the interested parties would submit bids since neither they nor FDIC had an opportunity to perform due diligence on the First City bank assets on such short notice. DOR officials could have used the OCC examiners’ assessment of asset quality as a means of verifying the asset valuations estimated through its own techniques. This would have been similar to the way FDIC uses its research model on smaller resolutions, i.e., as an independent check against the valuations. Also, the FDIC Board could have used such information since it was not confident that the more traditional resolution estimating techniques provided reliable results for the circumstances relative to the failing bank. The going concern valuation used by OCC examiners may even have been more relevant than the net realizable valuation used by DOR because FDIC expected a bridge bank or open bank assistance resolution to be the most orderly and least costly resolution alternative. FDIC and OCC provided written comments on a draft of this report, which are described below and reprinted in appendixes IV and V. FRS also reviewed a draft, generally agreed with the information as presented, but provided no written comments. FDIC described the report as being well researched and an overall accurate recording of the events that led up to and through the 1988 and 1992 transactions. FDIC offered further information and explanation related to the two transactions, including reasons why some of the lessons to be learned could not have been used by FDIC in 1988 and 1992 or would not have altered the outcomes of these transactions. FDIC further stated, however, that it will consider the lessons enumerated in the report and, where appropriate, incorporate them into future resolution decisions. We believe FDIC’s elaborations about the 1988 and 1992 transactions provide meaningful insights about its assistance and resolutions processes. The Executive Director, in later discussions about FDIC’s written comments, assured us that FDIC is open and receptive to the lessons to be learned, and his elaborations were intended to explain the bases for FDIC’s decisions and why other positions were not considered or taken at the time of the transactions. OCC raised concerns that the report might create an inference that we were questioning OCC’s basis to close the First City banks and about our suggestion that OCC needs to improve the quality of its examination reporting and workpaper documentation. OCC believes its basic standards for examiner documentation are appropriate for supervisory oversight and examiner decisionmaking purposes. While OCC believes its basic approach to be sound, including its documentation practices, it will consider our views in reviewing current examination guidance for potential revision to provide clarity, ensure consistency, and reduce burden. Our study was basically intended to provide an accurate accounting of the events, involving both the banks and regulators, that led to the 1988 and 1992 transactions to resolve First City. In compiling this account, we identified lessons to be learned from the First City experience that could potentially improve the insurer’s and regulators’ open bank assistance, bank closure, and bank resolution processes. We did not question the bases used by the insurer or regulators in making decisions relative to First City, but instead we looked for opportunities to improve those processes to ensure the insurer’s and regulators’ interests are adequately protected in making future decisions. The insurer and regulators, including FRS, generally agreed to consider the lessons to be learned from the First City experience to improve their processes. We will provide copies of this report to the Chairman, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation; the Comptroller of the Currency; the Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board; and the Acting Director of the Office of Thrift Supervision. We will also provide copies to other interested congressional committees and members, federal agencies, and the public. This review was done under the direction of Mark J. Gillen, Assistant Director, Financial Institutions and Markets Issues. Other major contributors to this review are listed in appendix VI. If you have any questions about the report, please call me on (202) 512-8678. Concerned with FDIC’s provision of $970 million financial assistance to First City banks in 1988 and their ultimate failure less than 5 years later, the former Chairman of the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs asked us to review the events surrounding First City Bancorporation of Texas’ 1988 and 1992 resolutions and to use our review to reflect on FDIC’s use of open bank assistance. As agreed with the Committee, we focused our review on First City’s largest bank in Houston and its second largest bank in Dallas, because the financial difficulties of these two banks resulted in the insolvency of First City’s 18 other banks. Our objectives were to review the events leading up to First City’s 1988 open bank assistance and its 1992 bank failures to determine why FDIC provided open bank assistance in 1988 rather than close the First why the 1992 resolution estimate differed so much from the estimate resulting from the 1993 sale of the banks; whether the First City banks’ failures in 1992 are expected to result in additional costs to BIF; and whether the First City experience provides lessons relevant to the assistance, closure, and/or resolution of failing banks. To achieve our objectives, we reviewed examination reports and related available examination documents and workpapers relative to First City’s Houston and Dallas banks and other subsidiary banks for 1983 through 1992. We began our review of examination reports with the 1983 examination because OCC officials told us that was when they first identified safety and soundness deficiencies in First City banks. The 1993 examination also precipitated the first supervisory agreement between First City management and the bank regulatory agencies. In reviewing the examination reports we sought to obtain information on the condition of the banks at the time of each examination and the significance of deficiencies as identified by the regulators. We reviewed examination workpapers, correspondence files, and management reports to gain a broader understanding of the problems identified, the approach and methodology used to assess the conditions of the First City banks, and the regulatory actions taken to promote or compel bank management to address deficient conditions found by regulators. We also used the examination workpapers to compile lists of loans that caused significant losses to the banks to try and compare the loan quality problems arising from loans made before the recapitalization to those made by new bank management. We interviewed the OCC examiners-in-charge of the 1989 examinations and all subsequent examinations to obtain their perspectives on the conditions found at the First City banks. We also interviewed OCC National Office officials to obtain their views on the adequacy of OCC’s oversight of the banks. We reviewed all relevant examination reports, workpapers, and supporting documentation to assess their adequacy in explaining the positions taken by OCC relative to First City-Houston and the Collecting Bank. When we were unable to gain adequate information from the examination records, we sought further explanations from OCC examination officials and assessed those explanations when received. We also reviewed FDIC and FRS records of examinations and supporting documents, particularly those related to First City-Dallas. We also discussed issues relating to First City banks with FDIC and FRS officials. Further, we reviewed First City Bancorporation financial records and supporting documents and discussed issues relating to OCC, FDIC, and FRS oversight with First City officials. Finally, we reviewed FDIC records relating to First City’s 1988 recapitalization and FDIC’s 1992 and 1993 bridge bank decisions. We discussed issues relating to these actions with FDIC, OCC, FRS, and First City officials to obtain their viewpoints on the actions taken. We also reviewed FDIC, OCC, and FRS records assessing the economy and the conditions of Texas financial institutions from the mid-1980s to the early 1990s. FDIC and OCC provided written comments on a draft of this report. FRS also reviewed a draft, generally agreed with the information as presented, but provided no written comments. The agencies’ written comments are presented and evaluated on page 21 of the letter and reprinted in appendixes IV and V. We did our work between January 1993 and June 1994 at FDIC, OCC, and FRS in Washington, D.C.; at FDIC, OCC, and FRS in Dallas; and at the First City banks in Houston and Dallas. We did our work in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. The 1980s and the early 1990s were tumultuous times for the banking industry, especially in the Southwest. During this time, the banking industry experienced record profits followed by record losses, and a number of legislative and regulatory changes altered both the way banks did business and the way banks were regulated. The responsibility for regulating federally insured banks is divided among three federal agencies. OCC is the primary regulator for nationally chartered banks. FRS regulates all bank holding companies and state-chartered banks that are members of FRS. FDIC regulates state-chartered banks that are not members of FRS. FDIC is also the insurer of all federally insured banks and thrifts, which gives it the dual role of being both the regulator and insurer for many banks. The primary role of federal regulators is to monitor the safety and soundness of the operations of both individual banks and the banking system as a whole. The regulators’ major means of monitoring the banks is through the examination process. Examinations are intended to evaluate the overall safety and soundness of a bank’s operations, compliance with banking laws and regulations, and the quality of a bank’s management and directors. Examinations are also to identify those areas where bank management needs to take corrective actions to strengthen performance. When a regulator identifies an area where the bank needs to improve, it can require the bank to initiate corrective action through either formal or informal measures. These measures can be as informal as a comment in the examination report or as severe as the regulator ordering the bank to cease and desist from a particular activity or actually ordering the closure of the bank. The role of the insurer is to protect insured depositors in the nation’s banks, help maintain confidence in the banking system, and promote safe and sound banking practices. As the insurer of bank deposits, FDIC may provide financial assistance for troubled banks. The assistance may be granted directly to the bank or to a company that controls or will control it. FDIC may also grant assistance to facilitate the merger of banks. When a chartering authority closes a bank, it typically appoints FDIC as receiver for the bank. FDIC then arranges for insured depositors to be paid directly by FDIC or the acquiring bank and liquidates the assets and liabilities not assumed by the acquiring bank. Many banks, including First City’s, are owned or controlled by a bank holding company and have one or more subsidiary banks. Typically, in a bank holding company arrangement, the largest subsidiary bank is referred to as the lead bank. The subsidiary banks may or may not have the same types of banking charters, i.e., either national or state charters. Consequently, different regulators may be responsible for overseeing the lead bank and the other subsidiary banks in the organization, with FRS responsible for overseeing all bank holding companies. First City Bancorporation of Texas typified this structure. It consisted of a holding company, a nationally chartered lead bank, 11 other nationally chartered subsidiary banks, 5 state-chartered banks that were members of FRS, and 3 state-chartered banks that were not members of FRS. Hence, the First City organization was supervised and examined by all three federal bank regulators. Between the time FDIC first announced open bank assistance for First City in 1987 and its closure in 1992, a number of regulatory and legislative initiatives gave the federal government greater authority to deal with troubled financial institutions. Passage of the Competitive Equality Banking Act of 1987 (CEBA), the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act of 1989 (FIRREA), and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 (FDICIA) provided both regulators and the insurer greater authorities in dealing with troubled financial institutions. Their passage also provided the impetus for regulatory changes that granted regulators and the insurer greater authorities to close and resolve troubled financial institutions. The regulators’ expanded authority to close a bank is possibly one of the most significant changes that has occurred in the federal government’s oversight of banks. At the time of the 1988 First City reorganization, OCC had the authority to appoint FDIC as receiver for a national bank whenever OCC, through its examination of the bank, determined that the bank was insolvent. The National Bank Act did not define insolvency, and the courts afforded OCC considerable discretion in determining the standard for measuring insolvency. OCC used two standards to measure insolvency—a net worth standard and a liquidity standard. Basically, a bank becomes net worth or equity insolvent when its capital has been depleted. Similarly, a bank becomes liquidity insolvent when it does not have sufficient liquid assets—i.e., cash—to meet its obligations as they become due, regardless of its net worth. Following the 1988 First City reorganization, OCC promulgated a regulation that allowed it to find a national bank insolvent at an earlier stage than before. Under the new rule, OCC redefined primary capital to exclude a bank’s allowance for loan and lease losses. Prior to this change, OCC considered a national bank’s regulatory capital to include not only its retained earnings and paid-in capital but also the allowance a bank had set up for loan and lease losses; i.e., for uncollectible or partially collectible loans. According to OCC, the change brought OCC’s measurement of a bank’s equity more closely in line with generally accepted accounting principles’ measurement of equity. While this action was not specifically required by FIRREA, OCC stated the change was within the spirit of the 1989 amendments to the federal banking laws. The cross-guarantee provisions of FIRREA also granted FDIC authority to recoup from commonly controlled depository institutions any losses incurred or reasonably anticipated to be incurred by FDIC due to the failure of a commonly controlled insured depository institution. As in the case of the First City banks, the cross-guarantee assessment may result in the failure of an otherwise healthy affiliated institution if the institution is unable to pay the amount of the assessed liability. This provision imposes a liability on commonly controlled institutions for the losses of their affiliates at the time of failure, thereby reducing BIF losses. The law gives FDIC discretion in determining when to require reimbursement and to exempt any institution from the cross-guarantee provisions if FDIC determines that the exemption is in the best interest of the applicable insurance fund. The manner in which FDIC can resolve troubled banks involves another significant set of changes that has occurred since FDIC announced First City’s first resolution in 1987. More specifically, FDICIA now requires FDIC to evaluate all possible methods for resolving a troubled bank and resolve it in a manner that results in the least cost to the insurance fund. Prior to FDICIA’s least-cost test, FDIC was required to choose a resolution method that was no more costly than the cost of a liquidation. Currently, the only exception to the least-cost determination is when the Secretary of the Treasury determines that such a selection would have a serious adverse effect on the economic conditions of the community or the nation and that a more costly alternative would mitigate the adverse effects. To date, the systemic risk exception has not been used. FDIC’s ability to provide open bank assistance has also undergone significant changes since FDIC assisted First City in 1988. At that time, FDIC was authorized to provide assistance to prevent the closure of a federally insured bank. FDIC was permitted to provide the assistance either directly to the troubled bank or to an acquirer of the bank. Before providing the assistance, FDIC had to determine that the amount of assistance was less than the cost of liquidation, or that the continued operation of the bank was essential to provide adequate banking services in the community. To implement these provisions, FDIC adopted guidelines that open assistance had to meet. The key guidelines are summarized below: The assistance had to be less costly to FDIC than other available alternatives. The assistance agreement had to provide for adequate managerial and capital resources (from both FDIC and non-FDIC sources) to reasonably ensure the bank’s future viability. The agreement had to provide for the assistance to benefit the bank and FDIC and had to include safeguards to ensure that FDIC’s assistance was not used for other purposes. The financial effect on the debt and equity holders of the bank, including the impact on management, shareholders, and creditors of the holding company, had to approximate what would have happened if the bank had failed. If possible, the agreement had to provide for the repayment of FDIC’s assistance. FDICIA placed additional limits on FDIC’s use of open bank assistance. FDICIA added a new precondition to FDIC’s authority to provide open assistance under section 13(c), which is summarized below. Under FDICIA, FDIC may consider providing financial assistance to an operating financial institution only if the following criteria can be met: (a) Grounds for the appointment of a conservator or receiver exist or likely will exist in the future if the institution’s capital levels are not increased and it is unlikely that the institution will meet capital standards without assistance. (b) FDIC determines that the institution’s management has been competent and has complied with laws, directives, and orders and did not engage in any insider dealing, speculative practice, or other abusive activity. In addition to the previously discussed statutory changes, FDICIA contained a resolution by Congress that encourages banking agencies to pursue early resolution strategies provided they are consistent with the new least-cost provisions and contain specific guidelines for such early resolution strategies. Since FDICIA, a further statutory limitation has been placed on open assistance transactions. Section 11 of the Resolution Trust Corporation Completion Act of 1993 prohibits the use of BIF and Saving Association Insurance Fund (SAIF) funds in any manner that would benefit the shareholders of any failed or failing depository institution. In FDIC’s view, as set forth in its report to Congress on early resolutions of troubled insured depository institutions, this provision “largely eliminates the possibility of open assistance, except where a systemic risk finding” is made pursuant to the least-cost provisions. Another change to FDIC’s resolution alternatives occurred when CEBA provided FDIC the authority to organize a bridge bank in connection with the resolution of one or more insured banks. Essentially, a bridge bank is a nationally chartered bank that assumes the deposits and other liabilities of a failed bank. The bridge bank also purchases the assets of a failed institution and temporarily performs the daily functions of the failed bank until a decision regarding a suitable acquirer or other resolution alternative can be made. To better understand some of the factors that contributed to the ultimate failure of the 1988 recapitalized First City banks, we reviewed First City’s activities from 1988 to 1990 as reflected in examination reports and workpapers. The results of that review are summarized in this appendix. First City Bancorporation banks’ reported profits in 1988, 1989, and 1990 depended on nontraditional sources of income that were not sustainable. These profits were then used to justify the payment of cash dividends during 1989 and 1990 that significantly reduced the banks’ retained earnings. First City’s reliance on income from the Collecting Bank nearly equalled First City’s net income during 1988 and 1989, First City’s only profitable years. Furthermore, we found that if it were not for the $73 million in interest and fee income the Collecting Bank paid First City in 1988, the latter would have lost about $7 million that year. While First City’s 1989 net income did not completely depend upon the Collecting Bank’s interest and fees, we found that such income accounted for nearly $100 million of the $112 million in net income earned by First City during 1989. Another nontraditional source of First City income was generated in the first quarter of 1990 when First City sold its credit card portfolio for a $139 million profit. This sale enabled First City to turn an otherwise $49 million loss from operations into a $90 million net profit during the quarter that ended March 31, 1990. These nontraditional sources of income accounted for nearly all of First City’s net income during the first 2 years of operations after recapitalization and did not necessarily indicate a significant problem with First City’s operations. It is also not necessarily a basis for criticizing First City’s management. First City’s reliance on income from nontraditional sources could be explained as the result of initial start-up problems associated with taking over a large regional multibank holding company during a period of economic instability. What is noteworthy is that First City used the profits on income from nontraditional and onetime sources to pay $122 million in cash dividends, thereby decreasing the bank’s retained earnings. The assistance agreement’s only limitation on the payment of dividends was that common stock dividends could not exceed 50 percent of the period’s earnings. The anticipated success of the recapitalized First City was at least partially based upon the assumption that First City Bancorporation, including the Collecting Bank, would not experience further loan portfolio deterioration. This assumption proved to be incorrect. Problems with both pre- and post-recapitalization loan portfolios resulted in significant loan charge-offs and the depletion of bank equity. For example, we found that about $270 million in assets that originated prior to the recapitalization at First City’s Houston and Dallas banks resulted in nearly $75 million in losses. Furthermore, problems with pre-recapitalization assets also plagued the Collecting Bank. These problems forced First City to charge-off nearly $200 million of Collecting Bank notes by the time the banks were closed in October 1992. First City also experienced significant problems with loans originated after the 1988 reorganization. We found that First City suffered about $300 million in losses on such loans. Some of these losses occurred as a result of First City’s aggressive loan growth policy that increased its portfolio of loans to finance inherently risky, highly leveraged transactions. First City’s highly leveraged transaction lending peaked in 1989 at more than $700 million. Other significant losses resulted from First City’s international and other nonregional lending practices. Still other losses resulted from poor underwriting practices or adverse economic conditions. First City’s recapitalization prospectus predicted that the banks would realize savings of more than $100 million per year by reducing operating expenses to a level commensurate with industry standards. While First City realized at least some of the anticipated savings during its first 2 years of operations, it was unable to sustain these cost-cutting efforts. According to both OCC and FDIC, high operating expenses contributed to First City’s 1992 failure. As shown in table III.1, First City’s operating expenses did not decrease as First City’s net income, gross profits, and total assets decreased. Rather, First City’s operating expenses were the lowest during 1988 and 1989, when it reported year-end profits, and highest during 1990 and 1991, when it lost more than $380 million. Our review of First City’s escalating operating expenses showed that during 1990 and 1991—a period when the banks’ revenues and assets were decreasing—its data processing and professional services expenses increased because of the way in which payments for these services were structured in related long-term contracts. Furthermore, First City’s operating expenses were already high due to above-market long-term building leases negotiated before the recapitalization. (158) (225) The following are GAO’s comments on the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation’s letter dated October 24, 1994. 1. We agree with FDIC that it received bridge bank authority in 1987, prior to the 1988 First City resolution, but did not receive cross-guarantee authority until later, in 1989. We do not dispute the FDIC scenario regarding what may have happened had it exercised its bridge bank authority on the two troubled First City banks in 1988 without having the authority to recover the losses from the other affiliated First City banks. Under the circumstances, FDIC alternatives for resolving the First City banks in 1988 were to either provide open bank assistance for the two troubled banks, or wait until they failed and consider the other resolution methods, including bridge banks. 2. We do not dispute the FDIC position that regulatory agencies were invited to all important meetings or that its Board of Directors was aware of the regulators’ opinions prior to making the 1988 open bank assistance decision. Our suggestion, however, is for FDIC to actively consult with its regulatory counterparts about key assumptions used in resolution alternatives recommended to the Board. We believe FDIC could take better advantage through greater consultation in making economic projections. The Federal Reserve, for example, has developed considerable expertise. In later discussions with the Executive Director, he agreed with us that such consultation with regulatory counterparts would be of value, although he noted that the accountability for the resolution decision, along with its assumptions, resides with FDIC. 3. In later discussions with the Executive Director, he told us that he does not disagree with our suggestion that FDIC include safeguards in open bank assistance agreements. His only concern would be if the safeguards were so stringent as to discourage potential private investors, thereby potentially costing FDIC more to resolve a troubled bank. He agrees with us that FDIC’s responsibility is to protect the Bank Insurance Fund and FDIC should include safeguards in its assistance agreements. 4. We agree that FDIC could realistically enforce the assistance agreement conditions only if FDIC determined that the bank breached the contractual conditions. The Executive Director told us that he is receptive to including provisions in future FDIC assistance agreements that authorize primary regulators to take enforcement actions if they find noncompliance with safeguards contained in future FDIC assistance agreements. His primary concern involves the potential of discouraging private investors, although he also believes there may be some practical problems in agreeing on conditions that serve the interests of the acquirer, the insurer, and the primary regulator. The Executive Director understands that such provisions would enable the primary regulator to gather the necessary information and have the requisite authority to take the appropriate enforcement action to ensure compliance with the relevant provisions of the assistance agreement. 5. We agree that in 1992, earlier FDIC notification of OCC’s finding that First City-Houston was insolvent may not have provided FDIC with a broader range of resolution alternatives because First City management was still convinced that it could raise sufficient capital to make the bank financially viable. Consequently, while some potential investors or acquirers had performed due diligence relative to earlier First City self-rescue proposals, FDIC did not believe sufficient due diligence had been performed by potential acquirers or that First City management would permit those interested to perform due diligence. Therefore, FDIC believed bridge banks would provide for the most orderly resolution, which FDIC also determined to be the least costly resolution alternative available at that time. While earlier notification may not have affected the First City resolution, the Executive Director agreed with us that early notification of insolvency is critically important for FDIC to consider the full range of resolution alternatives. He also said that FDIC is in regular contact with primary regulators to ensure early warning of potential insolvencies to maximize its resolution options. 6. We agree that examiners typically value assets on a going concern basis, and resolvers value the assets on a net realizable value presuming that they will be liquidated. The Executive Director, however, agreed with us that in unique situations like First City—where a high percentage of the assets were just assessed by examiners and market interest in the troubled banks suggests the assets will be acquired by a healthy bank—FDIC could use the examiners’ assessments as a secondary source to check on the validity of its asset valuation review results. Such a use would be comparable to how FDIC generally uses its research model, the results of which the FDIC Board of Directors may consider in its deliberations in making its resolution decisions. The following are GAO’s comments on the Comptroller of the Currency’s letter dated January 5, 1995. 1. Our objectives in the First City study included a review of the processes used by regulators to assist, close, or otherwise resolve failing financial institutions. We reviewed the adequacy of those processes, including the bases for the related decisions made by federal regulators for First City. While we found some deficiencies in the processes as applied in the First City decisions and suggested opportunities to improve those processes from the First City experience, it was not our objective nor did we take a position on the regulators’ decisions. 2. We agree with OCC that its basic standards for examination reporting and workpaper documentation are adequate based on this study and on other GAO studies of OCC’s examination process. In our report entitled Bank and Thrift Regulation: Improvements Needed in Examination Quality and Regulatory Structure (GAO/AFMD-93-15), dated February 16, 1993, we found that OCC generally adequately documented its examination results. Although we did not find in our study of First City adequate documentation for the examination results, OCC officials assured us that our concerns are being considered in their efforts to improve OCC examination processes, including the documentation of examination results.

GAO found that: (1) in 1988, FDIC provided $970 million in financial assistance to recapitalize and restructure the banking organization; (2) FDIC chose this method of resolution because it was less costly than liquidating the banks in the event of insolvency; (3) FDIC estimated BIF costs to liquidate the banks to be about $1.74 billion, as opposed to the $970 million estimated for open bank assistance; (4) FDIC did not opt to sell the banks because it did not believe that it would be able to find acceptable buyers with sufficient capital to restore the banks to long-term viability; (5) FDIC placed the banks under its control for about 3 months and operated them as bridge banks to facilitate the orderly resolution of the banks; (6) FDIC relied on its best business judgment in estimating BIF costs at the time of the banks' failures; (7) FDIC considered loss estimates that ranged from $300 million to over $1 billion in making its least-cost resolution determination; (8) the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency could have better supported its decision to close the largest bank by ensuring that its examination reports and underlying workpapers were clear, well documented, and self-explanatory; and (9) FDIC resolution officials could have used OCC examination findings as a means of verifying its valuation of the banks' assets.",govreport
"In the early 1980s, Congress had concerns about a lack of adequate oversight and accountability for federal assistance provided to state and local governments. Before passage of the Single Audit Act in 1984 (the act), the federal government relied on audits of individual grants to help gain assurance that state and local governments were properly spending federal assistance. Those audits focused on whether the transactions of specific grants complied with program requirements. The audits usually did not address financial controls and were, therefore, unlikely to find systemic problems with an entity’s fund management. Further, individual grant audits were conducted on a haphazard schedule, which resulted in large portions of federal funds being unaudited each year. In addition, the auditors conducting the individual grant audits did not coordinate their work with the auditors of other programs. As a result, some entities were subject to numerous grant audits each year, while others were not audited for long periods. In response to concerns that large amounts of federal financial assistance were not subject to audit and that agencies sometimes overlapped on oversight activities, Congress passed the Single Audit Act of 1984. The act stipulated that state and local governments that received at least $100,000 in federal financial assistance in a fiscal year have a single audit conducted for that year. The concept of a single audit was created to replace multiple grant audits with one audit of an entity as a whole. State and local governments which received between $25,000 and $100,000 in federal financial assistance had the option of complying with audit requirements of the act or the audit requirements of the federal program(s) that provided the assistance. The objectives of the Single Audit Act, as amended, are to promote sound financial management, including effective internal control, with respect to federal awards administered by nonfederal entities; establish uniform requirements for audits of federal awards administered promote the efficient and effective use of audit resources; reduce burdens on state and local governments, Indian tribes, and nonprofit organizations; and ensure that federal departments and agencies, to the maximum extent practicable, rely upon and use audit work done pursuant to the act. The Single Audit Act adopted the single audit concept to help meet the needs of federal agencies for grantee oversight as well as grantees’ needs for single, uniformly structured audits. Rather than being a detailed review of individual grants or programs, the single audit is an organizationwide financial statement audit that includes the audit of the Schedule of Expenditures of Federal Awards (SEFA) and also focuses on internal control and the recipient’s compliance with laws and regulations governing the federal financial assistance received. The act also required that grantees address material noncompliance and internal control weaknesses in a corrective action plan, which is to be submitted to appropriate federal officials. The act further required that single audits be performed in accordance with GAGAS issued by GAO. These standards provide a framework for conducting high-quality financial audits with competence, integrity, objectivity, and independence. The Single Audit Act Amendments of 1996 refined the Single Audit Act of 1984 and established uniform requirements for all federal grant recipients. The refinements cover a range of fundamental areas affecting the single audit process and single audit reporting, including provisions to extend the law to cover all recipients of federal financial assistance, including, in particular, nonprofit organizations, hospitals, and universities; ensure a more cost-beneficial threshold for requiring single audits; more broadly focus audit work on the programs that present the greatest financial risk to the federal government; provide for timely reporting of audit results; provide for summary reporting of audit results; promote better analyses of audit results through establishment of a federal clearinghouse and an automated database; and authorize pilot projects to further streamline the audit process and make it more useful. The 1996 amendments required the Director of OMB to designate a Federal Audit Clearinghouse (FAC) as the single audit repository, required the recipient entity to submit financial reports and related audit reports to the clearinghouse no later than 9 months after the recipient’s year-end, and increased the audit threshold to $300,000. The criteria for determining which entities are required to have a single audit are based on the total amount of federal awards expended by the entity. The initial dollar thresholds were designed to provide adequate audit coverage of federal funds without placing an undue administrative burden on entities receiving smaller amounts of federal assistance. When the act was passed, the dollar threshold criteria for the audit requirement were targeted toward achieving audit coverage for 95 percent of direct federal assistance to local governments. As part of OMB’s biennial threshold review required by the 1996 amendments, OMB increased the dollar threshold for requirement of a single audit to $500,000 in 2003 for fiscal years ending after December 31, 2003. Federal oversight responsibility for implementation of the Single Audit Act is currently shared among various entities—OMB, federal agencies, and their respective Offices of Inspector General (OIG). The Single Audit Act assigned OMB the responsibility of prescribing policies, procedures, and guidelines to implement the uniform audit requirements and required each federal agency to amend its regulations to conform to the requirements of the act and OMB’s policies, procedures, and guidelines. OMB issued Circular No. A-133, Audits of States, Local Governments, and Non-Profit Organizations, which sets implementing guidelines for the audit requirements and defines roles and responsibilities related to the implementation of the Single Audit Act. The federal agency that awards a grant to a recipient is responsible for ensuring recipient compliance with federal laws, regulations, and the provisions of the grant agreements. The awarding agency is also responsible for overseeing whether the single audits are completed in a timely manner in accordance with OMB Circular No. A-133 and for providing annual updates of the Compliance Supplement to OMB. Some federal agencies rely on the OIG to perform quality control reviews (QCR) to assess whether single audit work performed complies with OMB Circular No. A-133 and auditing standards. The grant recipient (auditee) is responsible for ensuring that a single audit is performed and submitted when due, and for following up and taking corrective action on any audit findings. The auditor of the grant recipient is required to perform the audit in accordance with GAGAS. A single audit consists of (1) an audit and opinions on the fair presentation of the financial statements and the SEFA; (2) gaining an understanding of internal control over federal programs and testing internal control over major programs; and (3) an audit and an opinion on compliance with legal, regulatory, and contractual requirements for major programs. The audit also includes the auditor’s schedule of findings and questioned costs, and the auditee’s corrective action plans and a summary of prior audit findings that includes planned and completed corrective actions. Under GAGAS, auditors are required to report on significant deficiencies in internal control and on compliance associated with the audit of the financial statements. Recipients expending more than $50 million in federal funding ($25 million prior to December 31, 2003) are required to have a cognizant federal agency for audit in accordance with OMB Circular No. A-133. The cognizant agency for audit is the federal awarding agency that provides the predominant amount of direct funding to a recipient unless OMB otherwise makes a specific cognizant agency assignment. The cognizant agency for audit provides technical audit advice, considers requests for extensions to the submission due date for the recipient’s reports, obtains or conducts QCRs, coordinates management decisions for audit findings, and conducts other activities required by OMB Circular No. A-133. According to OMB officials, the FAC single audit database generates a listing of those agencies that should be designated cognizant agencies for audit based on information on recipients expending more than $50 million. The officials also stated that OMB is responsible for notifying both the recipient and cognizant agency for audit of the assignment. Federal award recipients that do not have a cognizant agency for audit are assigned an oversight agency for audit, which provides technical advice and may assume some or all of the responsibilities normally performed by a cognizant agency for audit. Federal grant awards to state and local governments have increased significantly since the Single Audit Act was passed in 1984. Because single audits represent the federal government’s primary accountability tool over billions of dollars each year in federal funds provided to state and local governments and nonprofit organizations, it is important that these audits are carried out efficiently and effectively. As shown in figure 1, the federal government’s use of grants to state and local governments has risen substantially, from $7 billion in 1960 to almost $450 billion budgeted in 2007. GAO supported the passage of the Single Audit Act, and we continue to support the single audit concept and principles behind the act as a key accountability mechanism over federal grant awards. However, the quality of single audits conducted under this legislation has been a longstanding area of concern since the passage of the Single Audit Act in 1984. During the 1980s, GAO issued reports that identified concerns with single audit quality, including issues with insufficient evidence related to audit planning, internal control and compliance testing, and the auditors’ adherence to GAGAS. The federal Inspectors General as well have found similar problems with single audit quality. The deficiencies we cited during the 1980s were similar in nature to those identified in the recent PCIE report. In June 2002, GAO and OMB testified at a House of Representatives hearing about the importance of single audits and their quality. In its testimony, OMB identified reviews of single audit quality performed by several federal agencies that disclosed deficiencies. However, OMB emphasized that an accurate statistically based measure of audit quality was needed, and should include both a baseline of the current status and the means to monitor quality in the future. We also recognized in our testimony the need for a solution or approach to evaluate the overall quality of single audits. To gain a better understanding of the extent of single audit quality deficiencies, OMB and several federal OIGs decided to work together to develop a statistically based measure of audit quality, known as the National Single Audit Sampling Project. The work was conducted by a committee of representatives from the PCIE, the Executive Council on Integrity and Efficiency (ECIE), and three State Auditors, with the work effort coordinated by the U.S. Department of Education OIG. The Project had two primary objectives: to determine the quality of single audits by performing QCRs of a statistical sample of single audits, and to make recommendations to address any audit quality issues noted. The project conducted QCRs of a statistical sample of 208 audits randomly selected from a universe of over 38,000 audits submitted and accepted for the period April 1, 2003, through March 31, 2004. The sample was split into two strata: Stratum 1: entities with $50 million or more in federal award expenditures, Stratum 2: entities with less than $50 million in federal award expenditures (with at least $500,000). The above split in the sample strata corresponds with the current threshold for designating a cognizant agency, which is for entities that expend more than $50 million in a year in federal awards. Table 1 shows the universe and strata used in the analysis and the reviews completed in the National Single Audit Sampling Project. The project covered portions of the single audit relating to the planning, conducting, and reporting of audit work related to (1) the review and testing of internal control and (2) compliance testing pertaining to compliance requirements for selected major federal programs. The scope of the project included review of audit work related to the SEFA and the content of all of the auditors’ reports on the federal programs. The project did not review the audit work and reporting related to the general purpose financial statements. The PCIE project team categorized the audits based on the results of the QCRs into the following three groups: Acceptable—No deficiencies were noted or one or two insignificant deficiencies were noted. This group also includes the subgroup, Accepted with Deficiencies, which is defined as one or more deficiencies with applicable auditing criteria noted that do not require corrective action for the engagement, but should be corrected on future engagements. Audits categorized into this subgroup have limited effect on reported results and do not call into question the auditor’s report. Examples of deficiencies that fall into this subgroup are (1) not including all required information in the audit findings; (2) not documenting the auditor’s understanding of internal control, but testing was documented for most applicable compliance requirements; and (3) not documenting internal control or compliance testing for a few applicable compliance requirements. Limited Reliability—Contains significant deficiencies related to applicable auditing criteria and requires corrective action to afford reliance upon the audit. Deficiencies for audits categorized into this group have a substantial effect on some of the reported results and raise questions about whether the auditors’ reports are correct. Examples of deficiencies that fall into this category are (1) documentation did not contain adequate evidence of the auditors’ understanding of internal control or testing of internal control for many or all compliance requirements; however, there was evidence that most compliance testing was performed; (2) lack of evidence that work related to the SEFA was adequately performed; and (3) lack of evidence that audit programs were used for auditing internal control, compliance, and/or the SEFA. Unacceptable—Substandard audits with deficiencies so serious that the auditors’ opinion on at least one major program cannot be relied upon. Examples of deficiencies that fall into this group are (1) no evidence of internal control testing and compliance testing for all or most compliance requirements for one or more major programs, (2) unreported audit findings, and (3) at least one incorrectly identified major program. As shown in table 2, the PCIE study estimated that, overall, approximately 49 percent of the universe of single audits fell into the acceptable group. This percentage also includes “accepted with deficiencies.” The remaining 51 percent had deficiencies that were severe enough to cause the audits to be classified as having limited reliability or being unacceptable. Specifically, for the 208 audits drawn from the universe, the statistical sample showed the following about the single audits reviewed in the PCIE study: 115 were acceptable and thus could be relied upon. This includes the category of “accepted with deficiencies.” Based on this result, the PCIE study estimated that 48.6 percent of the entire universe of single audits were acceptable. 30 had significant deficiencies and thus were of limited reliability. Based on this result, the PCIE study estimated that 16.0 percent of the entire universe of single audits was of limited reliability. 63 were unacceptable and could not be relied upon. Based on this result, the PCIE study estimated that 35.5 percent of the entire universe of single audits was unacceptable. It is important to note the significant difference in results in the two strata. Specifically, 63.5 percent of the audits of entities in stratum 1 (those expending $50 million or more in federals awards) were deemed acceptable, while 48.2 percent of audits in stratum 2 (those expending at least $500,000 but less than $50 million) were deemed acceptable. Because of these differences, it is also important to analyze the results in terms of federal dollars. For the 208 audits drawn from the entire universe, the statistical sample showed the following about the single audits reviewed in the PCIE study: The 115 acceptable audits represented 92.9 percent of the value of federal award amounts reported in all 208 audits the PCIE study reviewed. The 30 audits of limited reliability represented 2.3 percent of the value of federal award amounts reported in all 208 audits the PCIE study reviewed. The 63 unacceptable audits represented 4.8 percent of the value of federal award amounts reported in all 208 audits the PCIE study reviewed. The dollar distributions for the 208 audits reviewed in the study are shown in table 3. The most prevalent deficiencies related to the auditors’ lack of documenting an understanding of internal control over compliance requirements, testing of internal control of at least some compliance requirements, and compliance testing of at least some compliance requirements. The PCIE report states that for those audits not in the acceptable group, the project team believes that lack of due professional care was a factor for most deficiencies to some degree. The term due professional care refers to the responsibility of independent auditors to observe professional standards of auditing. GAGAS further elaborate on this concept in the standard on Professional Judgment. Under this standard, auditors must use professional judgment in planning and performing audits and in reporting the results, which includes exercising reasonable care and professional skepticism. Reasonable care concerns acting diligently in accordance with applicable professional standards and ethical principles. Using professional judgment in all aspects of carrying out their professional responsibilities—including following the independence standards, maintaining objectivity and credibility, assigning competent audit staff to the assignment, defining the scope of work, evaluating and reporting the results of the work, and maintaining appropriate quality control over the assignment process—is essential to performing a high quality audit. We previously noted similar audit quality problems in prior reports. In December 1985, we reported that problems found by OIGs in the course of QCRs mostly related to lack of documentation showing whether and to what extent auditors performed testing of compliance with laws and regulations. In March 1986, we reported that our own review of single audits showed that auditors performing single audits frequently did not satisfactorily comply with professional auditing standards. The predominant issues that we found in our previous reviews were insufficient audit work in testing compliance with governmental laws and regulations and evaluating internal controls. We also observed, through discussions with the auditors and reviews of their work, that many did not understand the nature and importance of testing and reporting on compliance with laws and regulations, or the importance of reporting on internal control and the relationship between reporting and the extent to which auditors evaluated controls. As a result, in 1986, we reported that the public accounting profession needed to (1) improve its education efforts to ensure that auditors performing single audits better understand the auditing procedures required, and (2) strengthen its enforcement efforts in the area of governmental auditing to help ensure that auditors perform those audits in a quality manner. Similar to our prior work, the PCIE report presents compelling evidence that a serious problem with single audit quality continues to exist. The PCIE study also reveals that the rate of acceptable audits for organizations with $50 million or more in federal expenditures was significantly higher than for audits for organizations with smaller amounts of federal expenditures. The results also showed that overall, a significant number of audits fell into the groups of limited reliability with significant deficiencies and unacceptable. In our view, the current status of single audit quality is unacceptable. We are concerned that audits are not being conducted in accordance with professional standards and requirements. These audits may provide a false sense of assurance and could mislead users of audit reports regarding issues of compliance and internal control over federal programs. The PCIE report recommended a three-pronged approach to reduce the types of deficiencies noted and improve the quality of single audits: 1. revise and improve single audit standards, criteria, and guidance; 2. establish minimum continuing professional education (CPE) as a prerequisite for auditors to be eligible to conduct and continue to perform single audits; and 3. review and enhance the disciplinary processes to address unacceptable audits and for not meeting training and CPE requirements. More specifically, to improve standards, criteria, and guidance, the PCIE report recommended revisions to (1) OMB Circular No. A-133, (2) the AICPA Statement on Auditing Standards (SAS) No. 74, Compliance Auditing Considerations in Audits of Governmental Entities and Recipients of Governmental Financial Assistance, and (3) the AICPA Audit Guide, Current AICPA Audit Guide, collectively to emphasize correctly identifying major programs for which opinions are make it clear when audit findings should be reported; include more detailed requirements and guidance for compliance testing; emphasize the minimal amount of documentation needed to document the auditor’s understanding of, and testing of, internal control related to compliance; provide specific examples of the kind of documentation needed for risk assessment of individual federal programs; present illustrative examples of properly presented findings; specify content and examples of SEFA and any effect on financial emphasize requirements for management representations related to federal awards, similar to those for financial statement audits; provide additional guidance about documenting materiality; and require compliance testing to be performed using sampling in a manner prescribed by the AICPA SAS No. 39, Audit Sampling, as amended, to provide for some consistency in sample sizes. The PCIE report recommendation called on OMB to amend its Circular No. A-133 to require that (1) as a prerequisite to performing a single audit, staff performing and supervising the single audit must have completed a comprehensive training program of a minimum specified duration (e.g., at least 16–24 hours); (2) every 2 years after completing the comprehensive training, auditors performing single audits complete a minimum specified amount of CPE; and (3) single audits may only be procured from auditors who meet the above training requirements. The PCIE report also recommends that OMB develop, or arrange for the development of, minimum content requirements for the required training, in consultation with the National State Auditors Association (NSAA), the AICPA and its Governmental Audit Quality Center (GAQC), and the cognizant and oversight agencies for audit. The report states that the minimum content should cover the essential components of single audits and emphasize aspects of single audits for which deficiencies were noted in this project. In addition, the report recommends that OMB develop, or arrange for the development of, minimum content requirements for the ongoing CPE and develop a process for modifying future content. The report further recommends that OMB encourage professional organizations, including the AICPA, the NSAA, and qualified training providers, to offer training that covers the required content. It also recommends that OMB encourage these groups to deliver the training in ways that enable auditors throughout the United States to take the training at locations near or at their places of business, including via technologies such as Webcasts, and that the training should be available at an affordable cost. The PCIE project report emphasizes that the training should be “hands on” and should cover areas where the project team specifically found weaknesses in the work or documentation in its statistical study of single audits. The report specifically stated that the training should cover requirements for properly documenting audit work in accordance with GAGAS and other topics related to the many deficiencies disclosed by the project, including critical and unique parts of a single audit, such as the auditors’ determination of major programs for testing, review and testing of internal controls over compliance, compliance testing, auditing procedures applicable to the SEFA, how to use the OMB Compliance Supplement, and how to audit major programs not included in the Compliance Supplement. The PCIE report concludes that such training would require a minimum of 16 to 24 hours, and that a few hours or an “overview” session will not suffice. We believe that the proposed training requirements would likely satisfy the criteria for meeting a portion of the CPE hours already required by GAGAS. This recommendation focuses on developing processes to address unacceptable audits and auditors not meeting the required training requirements. OMB Circular No. A-133 currently has sanctions that apply to an auditee (i.e., the entity being audited) for not having a properly conducted audit and requires cognizant agencies to refer auditors to licensing agencies and professional bodies in the case of major inadequacies and repetitive substandard work. The report noted that other federal laws and regulations do currently provide for suspension and debarment processes that can be applied to auditors of single audits. Some cognizant and oversight agency participants in the project team indicated that these processes are rarely initiated due to the perception that it is a large and costly effort. As a result, the report specifically recommends that OMB, with federal cognizant and oversight agencies, should (1) review the process of suspension and debarment to identify whether (and if so, how) it can be more efficiently and effectively applied to address unacceptable audits, and based on that review, pursue appropriate changes to the process; and (2) enter into a dialogue with the AICPA and State Boards of Accountancy to identify ways the AICPA and State Boards can further the quality of single audits and address the due professional care issues noted in the PCIE report. The report further recommends that OMB, with federal cognizant agencies, should also identify, review, and evaluate the potential effectiveness of other ways (both existing and new) to address unacceptable audits, including (but not limited to) (1) revising Circular No. A-133 to include sanctions to be applied to auditors for unacceptable work or for not meeting training and CPE requirements, and (2) considering potential legislation that would provide to federal cognizant and oversight agencies the authority to issue a fine as an option to address unacceptable audit work. While we support the recommendations made in the PCIE report, it will be important to resolve a number of issues regarding the proposed training requirement. Some of the unresolved questions involve the following: What are the efficiency and cost-benefit considerations for providing the required training to the universe of auditors performing the approximately 38,500 single audits? How can current mechanisms already in place, such as the AICPA’s Government Audit Quality Center (GAQC), be leveraged for efficiency and effectiveness purposes in implementing new training? Which levels of staff from each firm would be required to take training? What mechanisms will be put in place to ensure compliance with the training requirement? How will the training requirement impact the availability of sufficient, qualified audit firms to perform single audits? The effective implementation of the third prong, developing processes to address unacceptable audits and for auditors who do not meet professional requirements, is essential as the quality issues have been long-standing. We support the PCIE recommended actions to make the process more effective and efficient and to help ensure a consistent approach among federal agencies and their respective OIGs overseeing the single audit process. In addition to the findings and recommendations of the PCIE report, we believe there are two other critical factors that need to be considered in determining actions that should be taken to improving audit quality: (1) the distribution of unacceptable audits and audits of limited reliability across the different dollar amounts of federal expenditures by grantee, as found in the PCIE study; and (2) the distribution of single audits by size in the universe of single audits. These factors are critical in effectively evaluating the potential dollar implications and efficiency and effectiveness of proposed actions. The PCIE study found that rates of unacceptable audits and audits of limited reliability were much higher for audits of entities in stratum 2 (those expending less than $50 million in federal awards) than those in stratum 1 (those expending $50 million or more). Table 1 presented earlier in this testimony shows the data from the sample universe of single audits used by the PCIE. Analysis of the data shows that 97.8 percent of the total number of audits (37,671 of the 38,523 total) covered approximately 16 percent ($143.1 billion of the $880.2 billion) of the total reported value of federal award expenditures, indicating significant differences in distributions of audits by dollar amount of federal expenditures. At the same time, the rates of unacceptable audits and audits of limited reliability were relatively higher in these smaller audits. We believe that there may be opportunities for considering size characteristics when implementing future actions to improve the effectiveness and quality of single audits. For instance, there may be merit to conducting a more refined analysis of the distribution of audits to determine whether less-complex approaches could be used for achieving accountability through the single audit process for a category of the smallest single audits. Such an approach may provide sufficient accountability for these smaller programs. An example of a less-complex approach consists of requirements for a financial audit in accordance with GAGAS, that includes the higher level reports on internal control and compliance along with an opinion on the SEFA and additional, limited or specified testing of compliance. Currently, the compliance testing in a single audit is driven by compliance requirements under OMB Circular No. A-133 as well as program-specific requirements detailed in the compliance supplement. A less-complicated approach could be used for a category of the smallest audits to replace the current approach to compliance testing, while still providing a level of assurance on the total amount of federal grant awards provided to the recipient. Another consideration for future actions is strengthening the oversight of the cognizant agency for audit with respect to auditees expending $50 million or more in federal awards. As shown in the data from the sample universe of single audits used by the PCIE, 852 audits (or 2.2 percent) of the total 38,523 audits covered $737.2 billion (or 84 percent) of the reported federal award expenditures. This distribution suggests that targeted and effective efforts on the part of cognizant agencies aimed at improving audit quality for those auditees that expend greater than $50 million could achieve a significant effect in terms of dollars of federal expenditures. We continue to support the single audit concept and principles behind the act as a key accountability mechanism over federal awards. It is essential that the audits are done properly in accordance with GAGAS and OMB requirements. The PCIE report presents compelling evidence that a serious shortfall in the quality of single audits continues to exist. Many of these quality issues are similar in nature to those reported by GAO and the Inspectors General since the 1980s. We believe that actions must be taken to improve audit quality and the overall accountability provided through single audits for federal awards. Without such action, we believe that substandard audits may provide a false sense of assurance and could mislead users of audit reports. While we support the recommendations made in the PCIE report, we believe that a number of issues regarding the proposed training requirements need to be resolved. The PCIE report results also showed a higher rate of acceptable audits for organizations with larger amounts of federal expenditures and showed that the vast majority of federal dollars are being covered by a small percentage of total audits. We believe that there may be opportunities for considering size characteristics when implementing future actions to improve the effectiveness and quality of single audits as an accountability mechanism. Considering the recommendations of the PCIE within this larger context will also be important to achieve the proper balance between risk and cost-effective accountability. In addition to the considerations surrounding the specific recommendations for improving audit quality, a separate effort taking into account the overall framework for single audits may be warranted. This effort could include answering questions such as the following: What types of simplified alternatives exist for meeting the accountability objectives of the Single Audit Act for the smallest audits and what would the appropriate cutoff be for a less-complex audit requirement? Is the current federal oversight structure for single audits adequate and consistent across federal agencies? What alternative federal oversight structures could improve overall accountability and oversight in the single audit process? Are federal oversight processes adequate and are sufficient resources being dedicated to oversight of single audits? What role can the auditing profession play in increasing single audit quality? Do the specific requirements in OMB Circular No. A-133 and the Single Audit Act need updating? Mr. Chairman, we would be pleased to work with the subcommittee as it considers additional steps to improve the single audit process and federal oversight and accountability over federal grant funds. Mr. Chairman and members of this subcommittee, this concludes my statement. I would be happy to answer any questions that you or members may have at this time.

The single audit is an important mechanism of accountability for the use of federal grants by nonprofit organizations as well as state and local governments. However, the quality of single audits conducted under the Single Audit Act, as amended, has been a longstanding area of concern since the passage of the act in 1984. The President's Council on Integrity and Efficiency (PCIE) recently issued its Report on National Single Audit Sampling Project, which raises concerns about the quality of single audits and makes recommendations aimed at improving the effectiveness and efficiency of those audits. This testimony provides (1) GAO's perspective on the history and importance of the Single Audit Act and the principles behind the act, (2) a preliminary analysis of the recommendations made by the PCIE for improving audit quality, and (3) additional considerations for improving the quality of single audits. In the early 1980s, Congress had concerns about a lack of adequate oversight and accountability for federal assistance provided to state and local governments. In response to concerns that large amounts of federal financial assistance were not subject to audit and that agencies sometimes overlapped on oversight activities, Congress passed the Single Audit Act of 1984. The act adopted the single audit concept to help meet the needs of federal agencies for grantee oversight as well as grantees' needs for single, uniformly structured audits. GAO supported the passage of the Single Audit Act, and continues to support the single audit concept and principles behind the act as a key accountability mechanism for federal grant awards. However, the quality of single audits has been a longstanding area of concern since the passage of the act in 1984. In its June 2007 Report on National Single Audit Sampling Project, the PCIE found that, overall, approximately 49 percent of single audits fell into the acceptable group, with the remaining 51 percent having deficiencies severe enough to classify the audits as limited in reliability or unacceptable. PCIE found a significant difference in results by audit size. Specifically, 63.5 percent of the large audits (with $50 million or more in federal award expenditures) were deemed acceptable compared with only 48.2 percent of the smaller audits (with at least $500,000 but less than $50 million in federal award expenditures). The PCIE report presents compelling evidence that a serious problem with single audit quality continues to exist. GAO is concerned that audits are not being conducted in accordance with professional standards and requirements. These audits may provide a false sense of assurance and could mislead users of the single audit reports. The PCIE report recommended a three-pronged approach to reduce the types of deficiencies found and to improve the quality of single audits: (1) revise and improve single audit standards, criteria, and guidance; (2) establish minimum continuing professional education (CPE) as a prerequisite for auditors to be eligible to be able to conduct and continue to perform single audits; and (3) review and enhance the disciplinary processes to address unacceptable audits and for not meeting training and CPE requirements. In this testimony, GAO supports PCIE's recommendations and points out issues that need to be resolved regarding the proposed training and other factors that merit consideration when determining actions to improve audit quality. GAO believes that there may be opportunities for considering size when implementing future actions to improve the effectiveness and quality of single audits. In addition, a separate effort considering the overall framework for single audits could answer such questions as whether simplified alternatives can achieve cost-effective accountability in the smallest audits; whether current federal oversight processes for single audits are adequate; and what role the auditing profession can play in increasing single audit quality.",govreport
"JWST is envisioned to be a large deployable, infrared-optimized space telescope and the scientific successor to the aging Hubble Space Telescope. JWST is being designed for a 5-year mission to find the first stars and trace the evolution of galaxies from their beginning to their current formation, and is intended to operate in an orbit approximately 1.5 million kilometers—or 1 million miles—from the Earth. With a 6.5-meter primary mirror, JWST is expected to operate at about 100 times the sensitivity of the Hubble Space Telescope. JWST’s science instruments are to observe very faint infrared sources and as such are required to operate at extremely cold temperatures. To help keep these instruments cold, a multi-layered tennis-court-sized sunshield is being developed to protect the mirrors and instruments from the sun’s heat. The sunshield and primary mirror are designed to fold and stow for launch and fit within the launch vehicle. When complete, the observatory segment of JWST is to include several elements (Optical Telescope Element (OTE), Integrated Science Instrument Module (ISIM), and spacecraft) and major subsystems (sunshield and cryocooler). The JWST project is divided into three major segments: the observatory segment, the ground segment, and the launch segment. The hardware configuration created when the Optical Telescope Element and the Integrated Science Instrument Module are integrated, referred to as OTIS, is not considered an element by NASA, but we categorize it as such for ease of discussion. Additionally, JWST is dependent on software to deploy and control various components of the telescope as well as collect and transmit data back to Earth. The elements, major subsystems, and software are being developed through a mixture of NASA, contractor, and international partner efforts. See figure 1 below for an interactive graphic that depicts the elements and major subsystems of JWST. For more information on JWST’s organizational structure, see appendix III. Given JWST’s complexity, integration and test activities are comprised of five separate periods—two of which have already started—over the course of almost 7 years to build the observatory. During the test periods, the project works to mitigate risks to an acceptable level prior to launch. According to project officials, while some risks may be eliminated entirely through various mitigation strategies, others will be accepted as residual risks that remain upon launch. See figure 2 below for the overall planned integration and test flow for JWST that includes the remaining schedule reserve—or extra time built into the schedule to address any issues found. For the majority of the work remaining, the JWST project will rely on three contractors: Northrop Grumman, Harris (formerly Exelis), and the Space Telescope Science Institute (STScI). Northrop Grumman plays the largest role, developing the sunshield, the OTE, the spacecraft, and a cooling subsystem for the Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI). Northrop Grumman performs most of this work under a prime contract with NASA, but its work on the MIRI cooler is performed under a separate subcontract with the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL). Harris is manufacturing the test equipment, equipping the test chamber, and assisting in the testing of the optics of JWST. Finally, STScI will collect and evaluate research proposals from the scientific community and will receive and store the scientific data collected, both of which are services that they currently provide for the Hubble Space Telescope. Additionally, STScI is responsible for developing the ground system that manages and controls the telescope’s observations on behalf of NASA. The MIRI instrument, one of the four instruments within ISIM, requires a dedicated, interdependent two-stage cooler subsystem designed to cool the infrared light detector to about 6.7 Kelvin (K), just above absolute zero. This cooler is referred to as a cryocooler and works by moving helium gas through about 10 meters (approximately 33 feet) of refrigerant lines located on the sun-facing surface of the JWST observatory to the colder, shaded side where the ISIM is located. According to NASA officials, a cryocooler of this configuration has never been developed or flown in space before. See figure 3 below for an illustration of the MIRI cryocooler on JWST and the varying temperatures needed in different areas of the telescope. Complex development efforts like JWST face myriad risks and unforeseen technical challenges which oftentimes can become apparent during integration and testing. To accommodate these risks and unknowns, projects reserve extra time in their schedules—which is referred to as schedule reserve—and extra money in their budgets— which is referred to as cost reserve. Schedule reserve is allocated to specific activities, elements, and major subsystems in the event there are delays or to address unforeseen risks. Each JWST element and major subsystem has been allocated schedule reserve. When an element or major subsystem exhausts schedule reserve, it may begin to affect schedule reserve on other elements or major subsystems whose progress is dependent on prior work being finished for its activities to proceed. The element or major subsystem with the least amount of schedule reserve determines the critical path for the project. Any delay to an activity that is on the critical path will reduce schedule reserve for the whole project, and could ultimately impact the overall project schedule. Cost reserves are additional funds within the project manager’s budget that can be used to address unanticipated issues for any element or major subsystem and are used to mitigate issues during the development of a project. For example, cost reserves can be used to buy additional materials to replace a component or, if a project needs to preserve schedule reserve, reserves can be used to accelerate work by adding shifts to expedite manufacturing and save time. NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center (Goddard)—the NASA center with responsibility for managing JWST—has issued procedural requirements that establish the levels of both cost and schedule reserves that projects must hold at project confirmation. After this point, a specified amount of schedule reserve continues to be required throughout the remainder of development. In addition to cost reserves held by the project manager, management reserves are funds held by the contractors that allow them to address cost increases throughout development. We have found that management reserves should contain 10 percent or more on the cost to complete a project and are used to address different issues. JWST has experienced significant increases to project costs and schedule delays. Prior to being approved for development, cost estimates of the project ranged from $1 billion to $3.5 billion with expected launch dates ranging from 2007 to 2011. Before 2011, early technical and management challenges, contractor performance issues, low level cost reserves, and poorly phased funding levels caused JWST to delay work after confirmation, which contributed to significant cost and schedule overruns, including launch delays. The Chair of the Senate Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies requested from NASA an independent review of JWST in June 2010. In response, NASA commissioned the Independent Comprehensive Review Panel, which issued its report in October 2010, and concluded that JWST was executing well from a technical standpoint, but that the baseline funding did not reflect the most probable cost with adequate reserves in each year of project execution, resulting in an unexecutable project. Following this review, the JWST program underwent a replan in September 2011, and Congress in November 2011 placed an $8 billion cap on the formulation and development costs for the project. On the basis of the replan, NASA rebaselined JWST with a life-cycle cost estimate of $8.835 billion that included additional money for operations and a planned launch in October 2018. The revised life-cycle cost estimate included a total of 13 months of funded schedule reserve. In the President’s fiscal year 2013 budget request, NASA reported a 66 percent joint cost and schedule confidence level—lower than the 70 percent level noted in NASA procedural requirements—for these cost and schedule baselines. A joint cost and schedule confidence level is the process NASA uses to assign a percentage to the probable success of meeting cost and schedule estimates and is part of the project’s estimating process. In December 2014, we found that the project was progressing within the 2011 replan for both cost and schedule. We reported on technical challenges with JWST elements and major subsystems that had consumed a portion of the cost and schedule reserves. We also found that the cryocooler remained an ongoing challenge and continued to use a disproportionate amount of cost reserves. Finally, we found that NASA had not conducted a cost risk analysis since the 2011 replan. A cost risk analysis determines the reliability of a program’s cost estimate by determining a program’s cost drivers and the risk of cost overruns through an analysis that links historical schedule information along with technical issues and uncertainties in schedule and cost. Since new risks had emerged, we recommended that NASA follow best practices when it updated the 2011 analysis for the Northrop Grumman contract and ensure the analysis is updated as significant risks emerge in the future. NASA partially concurred with our recommendation and stated that the JWST program and project use a range of tools to assess all major contractors’ performance and that the project initiated a cost risk analysis of Northrop Grumman’s contract incorporating best practices and would update it when required by NASA policy. The status of NASA’s analysis and our evaluation of it are discussed later in the report. The JWST project is currently on schedule with 8.75 months of schedule reserve remaining. However, all of JWST’s elements and major subsystems are within weeks of moving onto the project’s critical path, potentially reducing schedule reserve further. This is a tenuous position for the project given that it must complete five integration and test periods, three of which have not yet started. Testing can uncover problems that can be difficult or time-consuming to resolve, thereby adding schedule risk to the project and the unusual complexity of JWST further heightens these risks. To achieve mission success, the project will have to address over 100 technical risks and ensure that the project’s potential areas for mission failure are fully tested and understood before project launch in October 2018. Overall project schedule reserve, currently at 8.75 months, remains above Goddard requirements and the project’s plan—which was set above the Goddard standard at the replan in 2011 and included more reserve than required. However, as shown in figure 4 below, the use of schedule reserve on any element or major subsystem—two of which have entered integration and testing phases—may reduce the overall project schedule reserve. While some use of schedule reserve is expected, the proximity of each element and major subsystem schedule to the critical path means that the project must prioritize the mitigations when problems occur. Overall, the project has used more than 30 percent of its schedule reserve established at the time of the replan in 2011 to address technical challenges. Our prior work has shown that it is in integration and testing where problems are most likely to be found and as a result, schedules tend to slip. As we found in 2012, the project has a set amount of time allocated to the final three integration and test efforts over the next 3 years, with between 2 and 4 months for each. This time could easily be used if a significant problem occurred. For example, the OTIS integration and test period—the first major integration involving OTE and ISIM—planned to start in 2016 currently has 3 months of schedule reserve allocated at the end of testing. The final event in the OTIS integration and test effort is a cryovacuum test that takes approximately 3 months to complete. If an issue occurred that required stopping and repeating the cryovacuum test, this reserve could easily be exhausted. Additionally, as the project moves further into integration and testing, events become more serial so flexibility will be diminished. Issues uncovered in integration and testing also tend to be more expensive to mitigate, due to increased schedule pressure. To prevent the use of additional schedule reserve, the project and its contractor for OTIS testing are taking proactive steps to reduce risk before testing needs to commence by ensuring the availability and readiness of test equipment and the cryogenic chamber to be used to test the optics of JWST. For example, the project’s contractor that is to test the optics has conducted two of three optical ground support equipment tests on a replica of the OTE with 2 of 18 primary mirror segments installed. According to the project, the first test met its intended objectives and provided valuable insight into the performance of the ground support equipment and preparation of the cryogenic chamber. The second test was completed in October 2015, and project officials are currently analyzing the results. The third test is to build upon these findings to provide further confidence for the eventual OTIS testing. Additionally, the contractor performed several risk mitigation activities, including additional testing of the large cryogenic chamber that will be used for OTIS testing, which revealed several issues, including a leak in the cryogenic chamber that would have had major impacts if not discovered and repaired before OTIS testing began. The project has used schedule reserve in 2015 to address various technical problems that have arisen. More specifically, the project experienced several problems with ISIM and OTE, elements in the two of five integration and test phases that have begun. For example, the ISIM heat straps—flexible straps that are to conduct energy and heat away from the instruments—did not perform as expected in testing. An investigation revealed design issues with the parts as delivered from the supplier. As a result, the heat straps were redesigned and reinstalled, which required the use of schedule reserve. Additionally, as a result of these and other issues, the beginning of the third cryovacuum test was delayed by 3 months. ISIM currently holds 1.75 months in schedule reserve—down from 4.5 months as we found last year—from its overall schedule reserve of 8.75 months to address any issues that may arise during the third cryovacuum test and before OTIS testing begins. Additionally, the OTE element used about 2 months of schedule reserve this past year due to workmanship issues related to the 76 cryogenic harnesses that connect to JWST’s mirrors. According to program and contractor officials, the majority of these harnesses were damaged due to use of inappropriate tooling by the supplier. The damage was not discovered until some of the harnesses were installed on the OTE. The harnesses were removed for inspection with most requiring repairs or replacement. According to contractor officials, initially, the harnesses would have been installed at Northrop Grumman’s facility in Redondo Beach, California, but due to the workmanship issues, and in an effort to preserve as much schedule as possible, all but two of the harnesses are being installed at Goddard after the OTE was transferred there to begin the integration of the mirrors with the backplane. Various spacecraft challenges during the past year have used about 3 months of schedule reserve. For example, Northrop Grumman planned for certain integration activities to be conducted concurrently. However, according to project officials, due to safety and access to the spacecraft bus, the work had to be completed sequentially instead which took longer than expected. Additionally, a propellant tank required redesign and rework to meet its requirements. Spacecraft bus structure integration has been completed and the bus assembly recently completed various fit checks and acoustics and dynamics testing in preparation for the spacecraft integration and testing phase to begin in 2016. Schedule reserve for the sunshield was reduced to 9.25 months—two weeks from the critical path—due to various manufacturing challenges, and additional reserves will likely be needed in the near future. For example, an anomaly with the membrane retention devices—which need to operate correctly to ensure that the sunshield can unfold properly— during qualification testing required a redesign of the parts. According to contractor officials, when the devices were released, the contact between the metal surfaces moving adjacent to one another resulted in a small amount of debris being generated. Project officials expressed concern that the debris posed a risk of damaging other parts of the telescope. A new design has since been tested and proven to no longer pose the same risk. Additionally, coordinating the testing of the five individual layers of the sunshield created some delays. The five layers of the sunshield are currently in various stages of assembly, with two layers having been delivered to Northrop Grumman from the supplier in April 2015 and November 2015, respectively. In addition, in October 2015, the project reported that a piece of flight hardware for the sunshield’s mid boom assembly was irreparably damaged during vacuum sealing in preparation for shipping. The effect of the accident on the schedule has not yet been determined as project and prime contractor officials are currently determining the path forward. The cryocooler continued to experience technical challenges in 2015 that used schedule reserve and delayed its delivery. Although it has now been delivered—approximately 18 months later than planned—the cryocooler remains a schedule risk as it begins testing. Northrop Grumman delivered the compressor assembly—the third and final cryocooler component to be delivered after the cold head assembly and electronics assembly—to JPL in July 2015. Over the last several years, the project has accommodated a series of cryocooler schedule slips by reordering and compressing JPL’s test schedule and resequencing the spacecraft bus integration schedule. For example, several tests that were initially planned to be conducted on flight hardware will now be conducted on the spare hardware later into JWST’s integration and testing phase and closer to launch. Additionally, in May 2015, the project used 3 weeks of reserve and removed 3 weeks of lower priority and redundant items from the planned 40 weeks of acceptance and end-to-end testing. The project took these actions to accommodate a further delay in the delivery of the compressor assembly. According to contractor officials, the delay was primarily caused by the contractor not scheduling enough time to complete the bake out—a process whereby moisture is removed by heating the compressor and pumping helium through it. Table 1 below shows the tests removed from the acceptance and end-to-end testing. According to JPL officials, the thermal tests removed were from those that would have tested the cryocooler compressor assembly with the electronics assembly. A program official stated that the risk of eliminating these tests has been reduced now that the compressor and electronics assembly have been tested together for the first time. NASA and JPL assessed the removal of the electromagnetic interference and electromagnetic compatibility testing as low risk, and a program official stated that additional parallel activities and testing of the spare electronics to further mitigate the risk have been added. However, various integration and test experts we spoke with noted that eliminating testing is a sign that the project may be taking on additional risk because discovery of issues may be pushed to higher levels of testing or to later in the testing phase, where problems are more costly and time consuming to address. To accommodate any delays to testing or problems that may be found, JPL currently maintains 12 weeks of reserve for acceptance and end-to- end testing of the cryocooler. According to JPL officials, a key driver in deciding to eliminate testing instead of using additional schedule reserve was to retain as much as possible in the event that a test has to be stopped and restarted—which would require approximately 5 weeks—in addition to the time it takes to mitigate a problem. At the completion of the acceptance and end-to-end testing programs, the cryocooler is needed for spacecraft integration and testing—when the spacecraft and sunshield are integrated—no later than August 2, 2016. Spacecraft integration and test is followed by the final observatory level integration and test— completing the telescope—which is expected to begin in September 2017. The cryocooler’s testing flow and schedule reserve leading to its integration with the spacecraft is depicted in figure 5 below. Because the development and delivery of the cryocooler by Northrop Grumman took significantly longer than expected and to maintain the 12 weeks of reserve, JPL must complete acceptance and end-to-end testing in a more schedule-compressed environment. However, challenges have persisted in bringing the cryocooler flight model to testing and completing development of the spare model which could be needed if the flight model is not available in time to be integrated into the observatory for launch. For example, despite having an extra 18 months to prepare for the cryocooler testing due to the delay in the delivery of the compressor assembly, the project noted concerns with JPL’s readiness to accept the flight hardware. Specifically, a procedure error led to an interruption of the ongoing testing of the electronics assembly and fit checks of the flight cooler tower assembly and flight refrigerant line deployable assembly were delayed because the procedures were late in being completed. JWST is one of the most technologically complex projects NASA has undertaken. The project incorporates nine critical technologies— technologies that are required for the project to successfully meet requirements—whereas we found the average technology development project at NASA incorporates an average of 2.3 critical technologies. JWST also incorporates 15 pre-existing technologies that are being leveraged from previous development efforts. Future testing on JWST has to reduce a significant amount of risk before the October 2018 launch. The project identifies and maintains a list of risks—currently with 102 items—that need to be tested and mitigated to an acceptable level in the next 3 years. According to the project, approximately 25 of these risks are not likely to be closed until the conclusion of the observatory integration and test phase—just prior to project launch. This is the point where the project has determined that no further mitigations are feasible and that these risks have been tested per a plan to reduce the risk, when possible, to an acceptable level. In some cases, it may take years to resolve a particular risk. For example, the project continues to track a risk related to the release mechanisms that hold the spacecraft and the OTE together for launch. Once in space, they are to activate and release to allow the OTE to separate from the spacecraft. If the mechanisms do not operate correctly, mission failure will occur. This risk was identified in January 2014 at the spacecraft critical design review. During testing, these devices were causing excessive shock when performing their releasing function. After redesign, the project is continuing to work on resolving the underlying problem and qualifying the new design. Additionally, while testing the redesigned mechanism, a new concern arose that it could release early which would cause mission failure. According to a program official, the redesigned mechanism is not needed for spacecraft integration and test until summer of 2016 and therefore these issues do not pose a significant schedule concern at this time. As integration and testing moves forward, the project will need to be able to resolve problems in a timely manner to stay on schedule. A backlog of unresolved problems and risks may indicate there may not be enough schedule left before launch to complete all necessary work. The project keeps track of these problems via problem reports and problem failure reports. Thus, ensuring that problem reports and problem failure reports are resolved in a timely manner is key to successfully launching the project on time. Project officials reported that they do not track problem report and problem failure report closure rates over time; instead, they monitor the reports to ensure that they are closed before subsequent test events and receive monthly briefings from the contractors on the status of their progress. According to project officials responsible for the ISIM and OTIS development and testing, while there are numerous problem reports open at any given time, they are comfortable with the number of open reports at this stage of the project. Northrop Grumman officials reported that development of the OTE, sunshield, and spacecraft are on track with respect to problem and failure reports, which they refer to as nonconformance reports. Additionally, experts we spoke with told us that addressing requests for action (RFAs) from project reviews is important because RFAs are written to identify potential risks to the project. Since the spacecraft critical design review in January 2014, the project has closed 14 RFAs from that review while one related to the release mechanism noted above remains open. The project tracks and reports open RFAs to senior management at NASA, and we will continue to examine the open RFA and additional RFAs that result from future reviews to monitor their timely closure. The extent of JWST’s deployments—which are necessary because JWST must be stowed for launch to fit in the launch vehicle—means the telescope could fail to operate as planned in an extensive number of ways. According to project officials, there are over 100 different ways that a failure could occur, referred to as single point failure modes, across hundreds of individual items in the observatory. Each of these could result in a loss of minimum mission objectives, and thus needs to be fully tested and understood. Nearly half of the single point failure modes involve the deployment of the sunshield. The approval of single point failures requires written justification from the project including sound engineering judgement, supporting risk analysis, and implementation of measures to mitigate the risk to acceptable levels. The project’s mission systems engineers have developed justifications and mitigation strategies for its single point failures, and project officials expect these to be summarized and submitted to the agency prior to launch. According to project officials, this approach is consistent with other high-priority NASA missions, which require the most stringent design and development approach that NASA takes to ensure the highest level of reliability and longevity on orbit. The JWST project continued to meet its cost commitments throughout fiscal year 2015 despite cryocooler delays that used a disproportionate amount of cost reserves. However, the project required larger than planned workforce levels to complete new and existing work, which poses a cost threat in future years if levels do not decrease. To help manage the project and account for new risks since the 2011 replan, JWST project officials conducted a cost risk analysis of the Northrop Grumman contract. We found that while the cost risk analysis substantially met best practices, these officials do not plan to periodically update it. Instead, the project is using risk-adjusted analyses to update and inform its cost position. However, we found that this method is a simplified version of a cost-risk analysis that does not contain the same rigor or allow the project to prioritize risks. Furthermore, we found anomalies in the contractor- provided data rendering the results of the analyses unreliable. Finally, we also found the project lacks an independent surveillance mechanism for the data to ensure anomalies are corrected by the contractor before being incorporated into larger analyses. As a result, the project is relying partially on unreliable information to inform its cost and schedule decision-making. Project officials managed JWST within its allocated budget for the fourth consecutive year since the 2011 replan. Additionally, the project’s fiscal year 2016 budget request to Congress is consistent with its cost commitment. According to preliminary estimates, at the end of fiscal year 2015, the project spent $68 million dollars more than planned at the beginning of the fiscal year, carrying over less money into fiscal year 2016 than originally planned. As in past years, the project used a portion of its cost reserves to address technical challenges that included funding activities to address significant delays with the cryocooler. The project also used program-level cost reserves to pay for new work that included conducting additional thermal verification tests and risk reduction activities, such as an analysis to better understand how JWST will likely interact with its launch vehicle—the Ariane 5. The cryocooler used a significant share of the project’s fiscal year 2015 cost reserves—more than 50 percent—to fund the workforce for this effort and address technical issues. This is the fourth year in a row that the cryocooler used a substantive portion of the project’s cost reserves to further fund the subcontractor’s schedule delays in delivering its components. The project estimates that the overall cryocooler development cost will be nearly 250 percent higher than baselined at the 2011 replan. The Northrop Grumman cryocooler team forecasts that a larger workforce is needed until at least February 2016 when the spare compressor assembly is currently scheduled to be delivered. JPL will maintain the majority of its workforce through the conclusion of spare cryocooler testing. After testing concludes, its workforce is projected to decrease by about 50 percent. Project cost reserves will likely continue to be needed to fund cryocooler development and testing costs until fiscal year 2017 when JPL testing of the spare compressor assembly is scheduled to conclude. While the project remains on cost, contractor work is costing more to complete because a larger workforce than planned was needed for components beyond the cryocooler, including Northrop Grumman for the sunshield, spacecraft, and OTE, and Harris for OTIS testing and preparation. This need derives from work taking longer than planned to complete and additional work requested by NASA. For example, Northrop Grumman’s workforce projections for fiscal year 2015 predicted a peak in the workforce in November 2014. However, the actual workforce peaked in February 2015 and continued to remain above the projected peak until August 2015. While workforce numbers have declined somewhat since February, these increases largely remained in place through the end of the fiscal year. In its role as prime contractor, Northrop Grumman’s workforce stayed within its budget in fiscal year 2015. From January through July of 2015, its workforce was exactly at its funding threshold in order to conduct new work and address technical issues for its body of work. In addition, larger workforces contributed to additional contractor cost for two other development efforts—OTIS testing and the cryocooler—requiring the use of additional project cost reserves. Looking forward, the primary threat to JWST meeting its long-term cost commitment is the prime contractor, which must continue to control its costs and decrease its workforce. For the past 20 months, Northrop Grumman’s actual workforce exceeded its projections. Figure 6 below illustrates the difference between the workforce levels that Northrop Grumman projected at the beginning of fiscal years 2014 and 2015 and its actual workforce levels for those periods. Based on its projections at the beginning of the fiscal year, Northrop Grumman exceeded its total fiscal year 2014 workforce monthly projections by about 12 percent, and exceeded its projections for fiscal year 2015 by about 20 percent. On average, in fiscal year 2015, Northrop Grumman was 121 FTEs above its projections each month, and at the end of fiscal year 2015, it exceeded its monthly projection for September 2015 by 235 FTEs. While actuals have remained above projections since the workforce levels peaked in February 2015, Northrop Grumman currently projects that its workforce will decline throughout fiscal year 2016, with the exception of August 2016, when additional work is projected to be needed for integration and testing, among other areas. However, this was the projection for both fiscal years 2014 and 2015 and has yet to happen. For example, while Northrop Grumman expected to be ramping down by the end of fiscal year 2014, its projections at the start of fiscal year 2015 were approximately 55 percent higher than where workforce levels were projected for the end of fiscal year 2014. The primary drivers that have increased the cost and size of the workforce under the prime contract have been the development of the sunshield and spacecraft and additional work NASA has requested. Over 60 percent of the cost increases are attributed to addressing technical concerns such as sunshield alignment and verification work, mechanical design integration, and spacecraft mass reduction. Northrop Grumman has covered additional costs pertaining to technical issues through its management reserves, and has not needed project cost reserves in fiscal years 2014 and 2015. The remaining cost increases are attributable to new contract scope which has been funded by the JWST program. Some of this new scope included additional spacecraft simulators, as well as new thermal risk reduction testing to verify the final design changes made to the core of the telescope–the region between all the observatory elements. Approximately 15 percent of work remains on Northrop Grumman’s contract and its management reserves exceed the recommended minimum amount that should be held at the contractor level—10 percent or more of the cost of work remaining on the project. Significant decreases in the workforce are planned to occur in fiscal year 2017 when final hardware delivery to observatory integration and test is scheduled to take place. To incentivize the contractor to lower its workforce, project officials evaluate workforce management as part of NASA’s appraisal of Northrop Grumman’s performance in its award fee determinations. The project also communicates frequently with the contractor including phone calls, face to face meetings twice a month, and quarterly in-person management meetings to discuss workforce planning, among other subjects. The project has communicated the need to reduce the workforce size, but since Northrop Grumman has operated within its budget in fiscal years 2014 and 2015, the award fee it has received has not been reduced as a result of workforce size issues. The subcontractor for OTIS testing, Harris, needed additional funding to cover cost overruns and additional work. Project cost reserves were utilized to pay for this work to maintain schedule through a contract change in January 2015. Over 55 percent of the increase was made to address cost overruns that resulted from increasing workforce levels to maintain schedule. The rest of the contract increase covered new scope. As a result, Harris is anticipating more work than originally planned for fiscal years 2016 and 2017. Despite the contract increases, Harris’s management reserves are 2.5 percent as of August 2015—significantly below the 10 percent cost of work remaining that is considered to be healthy. With over 25 percent of work remaining on its contract, this low level of reserves means that any additional overruns will likely need to be covered by project-held reserves. We found that NASA’s 2014 cost risk analysis on Northrop Grumman’s remaining work substantially met best practices. In December 2014, we recommended that project officials update the 2011 JWST cost risk analysis utilizing best practices, and to update it periodically as significant risks emerge. NASA partially concurred with our recommendation stating that the program and project use a range of tools to assess the performance of the project and conducted a one-time update to the cost risk analysis in 2014. We found that NASA’s updated cost risk analysis substantially met best practices. For example, it incorporated subject matter expert input to model cost and schedule uncertainties from the prime contractor’s threats and opportunities list—both of which are components of the best practice of modeling a probability distribution for each cost element’s uncertainty based on data availability, reliability and variability. See appendix I for a list of best practices that we used to evaluate cost risk and uncertainty. In addition, NASA included correlation between elements to account for different cost elements being affected by the same external factors—another best practice. However, the cost risk analysis also had some weaknesses as a result of not fully following best practices. For the first best practice noted above on modeling probability distribution, NASA relied on the contractor’s risk data without conducting corroborating interviews with contractor personnel to obtain insight into threats and opportunities not listed in contractor data. For the same best practice, the detailed schedule that reflected all of the work that needed to be done by Northrop Grumman that was used for the cost risk analysis had some activity sequencing logic issues. For example, we found instances where activities listed were not sequentially linked to one another. As a result, this called into question the calculation of the critical path during simulations as well as the ability of the schedule to dynamically respond to changes, which it must do thousands of times during the risk simulations. Moreover, the JWST project does not plan to periodically update its cost risk analysis even as additional risks have emerged. JWST officials stated that the cost risk analysis was a time intensive process to complete and that the program and project use various tools consistent with best practices to assess all major contractors’ performance. Nonetheless, best practices call for conducting periodic updates to a cost risk analysis as a project progresses even if it is not experiencing problems. Updating the cost risk analysis is also part of the best practice of implementing a risk management plan with the contractor which calls for identifying and analyzing risk, planning for risk mitigation, and continually tracking risks. An accurate cost risk analysis is particularly vital to JWST because about 70 percent of the project cost reserves have been used to address concerns that were not anticipated as threats by the project’s budget system. Failure to update the cost risk analysis as we recommended in 2014 limits stakeholder confidence that the cost risk analysis prepared in 2014 accurately reflects the project’s current financial status. Given this uncertainty, it is important for the project to have reliable information for the risks that are known to inform decision making. One of the tools that the project has started to use in place of updating the cost risk analysis is a monthly risk-adjusted analysis to provide insight into potential future cost growth. The monthly risk-adjusted analyses are based on contractor EVM data that incorporate known threats to provide an estimate at completion (EAC) that is updated monthly by NASA for each contractor. The results of these analyses may then be compared to the contractors’ estimates and project cost reserves to provide insight into the project’s ability to cover future increases. Monthly risk-adjusted analyses demonstrate a commitment by NASA to manage and project future costs. However, we found that the risk-adjusted analyses do not serve as an adequate substitute for an updated cost risk analysis because they are a simplified version of a cost risk analysis that does not allow the project to prioritize risks or assign confidence levels to meet key milestones in the schedule consistent with best practices for cost risk analyses. Additionally, based on our analysis of contractor EVM data over 17 months, we found that some of the data used to conduct the analyses were unreliable. First, we found that both Northrop Grumman and Harris were reporting optimistic EACs at the time of our analysis that did not align with their historical EVM performance and fell outside the low end of our independent EAC range. Second, we found various anomalies in contractor EVM data for both the Northrop Grumman and Harris work that they had not identified throughout the 17-month period we examined. The anomalies included unexplained entries for negative values of work performed (meaning that work was unaccomplished or taken away rather than accomplished during the reporting period), work tasks performed but not scheduled, or actual costs incurred with no work performed. For Northrop Grumman, many were relatively small in value ranging from a few thousand to tens of thousands of dollars. These anomalies are problematic because they distort the EVM data, which affect the projection of realistic EACs. We found that these anomalies occurred consistently within the data over a 17-month period, which brings into question the reliability of the risk-adjusted EAC analysis built upon this information. NASA did not provide explanations into the anomalies for either contractor. While the contractors were able to provide explanations for the anomalies upon request, their explanations or corrections were not always documented within EVM records. Some of the reasons the contractors cited that were not in the EVM records included tasks completed later than planned, schedule recovered on behind schedule tasks, and replanning of customer-driven tasks. Finally, like the cost-risk analysis in 2014, the risk-adjusted EAC analysis does not include interviews with contractor officials to gain insight into risks which may not be present in the contractors’ threats and opportunities list. Without updating the cost risk analysis, reconciling and documenting data anomalies, and utilizing reliable data for the risk-adjusted EAC, the JWST project does not have a reliable method to assess its cost reserve status going forward. This means that some of the cost information the project officials use to inform their decision making may indicate they are in good shape when the reality might be otherwise, and as result, project management may not have a solid basis for decision making. In discussions with the contractors, we found that the project also lacks an independent surveillance mechanism, such as the Defense Contract Management Agency, to monitor contractors’ EVM data—provided to the project each month from two of the contractors. Surveillance entails reviewing a contractor’s EVM system with the purpose of focusing on how well a contractor is using its EVM system to manage cost, schedule, and technical performance. However, the lack of surveillance and the data anomalies in EVM data are problems we previously identified across NASA’s portfolio of major spaceflight projects. We found in November 2012 that 4 of NASA’s 10 major spaceflight projects we reviewed had established formal independent surveillance reviews. For the 6 projects that did not have formal independent surveillance in place, we found that each provided evidence that they instituted monthly EVM data reviews, which according to project officials, helped them to continually monitor cost and schedule performance. However, we found that the rigor of both the formal and informal surveillance reviews was questionable given the numerous EVM data anomalies we found in the monthly EVM data. As a result, we recommended that NASA improve the reliability of project EVM data by requiring projects to implement a formal surveillance program that ensured anomalies in contractor-delivered and in-house monthly earned value management reports were identified and explained, and report periodically to the center and mission directorate’s leadership on relevant trends in the number of unexplained anomalies. Citing resource constraints, NASA partially concurred with the recommendation and commented that it did not plan to implement a formal surveillance program, but agreed that the reliability and utility of the EVM data needed to be improved and noted several steps it planned to take to do so. We continue to believe that implementing this recommendation would be beneficial and prevent anomalies in EVM data from occurring that we have identified on the JWST project. Implementing surveillance of EVM contractor data is a best practice listed in the NASA Earned Value Management Implementation Handbook and GAO’s Cost Estimating and Assessment Guide. With adequate surveillance in place, the anomalies we found in the EVM data could have been identified earlier and corrective action could have been directed to the contractors to explain the anomalies in the data. Without implementing proper surveillance, the project may be utilizing unreliable EVM data in its analyses to inform its cost and schedule decision making. NASA has taken steps to provide independent oversight of the JWST project. Independent oversight of the JWST project has played and will likely continue to play an important role leading up to JWST’s launch in October 2018. Before the 2011 replan, two groups examined JWST to address underlying concerns with schedule and cost and made recommendations that NASA implemented. On an ongoing basis until launch, the Standing Review Board and the Independent Verification & Validation (IV&V) facility are to continue to oversee progress on hardware and software development, identify concerns, and assist the project to identify solutions to reduce risk and improve JWST’s likelihood of success. Various groups internal and external to NASA have conducted reviews, provided insights, and identified schedule efficiencies to inform and enhance the project’s approach to managing the development of JWST. Prior to the 2011 replan and because of concerns raised at the JWST mission critical design review held in the spring of 2010, the Test Assessment Team was formed to address those concerns. Convened by the Astrophysics division of the NASA Science Mission Directorate, the team included nine members and three NASA consultants with considerable experience in systems engineering, instrument development, system verification, modeling and testing, and other areas focused on reviewing plans for the ISIM and OTIS cryogenic testing. The team was primarily tasked to determine whether (1) the test plans in place at that time were sufficient to test the relevant observatory functions, (2) the key optical and thermal objectives were clearly identified, (3) the test plans themselves were properly scoped and prioritized, (4) any duplicative or unnecessary tests existed in the plans, and (5) the plans were overly ambitious or optimistic regarding hardware performance and analysis capabilities. Their insights and recommendations have helped to decrease programmatic cost and future growth as well as to find schedule efficiencies. For example, they recommended OTIS testing duration be reduced from 167 to 90 days while still verifying critical functions of the telescope. Also prior to the 2011 replan, the Chair of the Senate Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies asked that NASA set up a panel to review the JWST project because of concerns about cost growth and schedule delays. In response, NASA convened the Independent Comprehensive Review Panel to provide an independent, integrated perspective and response with the goal of providing recommendations that would lead to a successful launch while minimizing cost. At the conclusion of its work in October 2010, the panel made 22 recommendations to NASA to increase oversight, improve communications, and assist with risk management and mitigation, among other recommendations. NASA implemented all of these recommendations. Both of these reports have informed our ongoing reviews of the JWST project as we have incorporated many of the concerns on cost estimates and cost reserves into our methodology and reporting on the health and status of JWST as it moves forward. Another aspect of independent oversight that is a key element of NASA’s strategic framework for managing space flight projects are Standing Review Boards which consist of technical experts who do not actively work on a specific project or program. The mission of the boards is to provide NASA senior management with objective information to ensure there is appropriate program and project management oversight to increase the likelihood of mission success. The boards help to determine the adequacy of programs’ (1) management approach, (2) technical approach, (3) integrated cost and schedule estimates and funding strategy, and (4) risk management, among others. NASA’s Independent Program Assessment Office and various NASA centers organize these boards and coordinate their involvement at different reviews. The boards are involved at various agency-level reviews with some members participating in lower-level reviews at NASA’s different centers, in monthly reviews held by the projects and program, or in special reviews on a specific topic or set of issues. Standing Review Boards may also make non-binding recommendations after life-cycle reviews, but do not have programmatic or technical authority over the programs or projects. The Standing Review Board Handbook describes three types of boards that may be formed to provide independent oversight of programs or projects. See table 2 below for the three types of Standing Review Boards. NASA’s Standing Review Board Handbook states that a civil servant consensus with no expert support is the preferred structure within NASA because experience demonstrates that a consensus board leads to a more meaningful discussion of the review findings and recommendations, especially where dissenting opinions are discussed. A non-consensus mixed board provides only the perspective of the chairman. In 2015, 1 of 33 active Standing Review Boards was a civil service consensus board with no expert support, 15 were civil service consensus with consultant support, and 17 were non-consensus mixed boards. Although NASA guidance prefers civil servant consensus boards, NASA officials told us that they have found it challenging to staff boards exclusively with civil servants for a number of reasons including availability of staff, finding a person with the appropriate skill set, and independence reasons, among others. JWST has had a number of changes occur on the boards overseeing the project for different reasons. JWST has had a Standing Review Board since 2006 when a special review was conducted. During that review and from 2008 to 2014, the board was a non-consensus board led by an outside expert chosen by NASA senior officials. The experts were civil servants as well as non-civil-servant experts. In May 2014, the chairman retired, a new chair was appointed the same year, and NASA senior officials changed the board to a consensus board with consultants. Independent Program Assessment Office officials told us that board types can change for numerous reasons, including when a project or program enters a different phase of development that may require different technical skills or if all of the convening authorities request it. As a result of the retirement of the chairman, most of the 2008-2014 Standing Review Board members who were not civil servants but who had overseen JWST for more than 6 years were replaced and 2 civil servants were carried over to the new board. Consultant support was added for schedule analysis and in one technical area to support launch vehicle integration because NASA has never launched a mission on an Ariane 5 rocket as it plans to do for JWST. Before retiring in 2015, the previous Standing Review Board chairman expressed the importance of having representation from JPL as a member of the board to provide experience working on unmanned spacecraft projects—but a JPL member could not be added since JPL employees are not civil servants and can only be consultants to the board. With the appointment of a new chairman in October 2015, there have been additional membership changes to the board including the addition of a JPL consultant. NASA’s IV&V facility—which independently examines software development—reviews mission critical software for most NASA programs and projects to achieve the highest levels of safety and cost-effectiveness by ensuring that developed software will perform as required. Experts at the facility work to uncover high-risk errors early in the development life cycle of software for many NASA programs and projects. IV&V is a process whereby organizations can reduce the risks inherent in system development and acquisition efforts by having a knowledgeable party who is independent of the developer to determine whether the system or product meets the users’ needs and fulfills its intended purpose. IV&V applies software engineering best practices to risk elements on safety critical and mission-critical software throughout the development life cycle. We have found IV&V to be a leading practice for federal agencies in managing their complex, large-scale, or high-risk acquisition of programs. Software development is a challenge we have found on many different acquisitions—some space-related—in government programs that has led to schedule delays and cost growth. Examples include the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, the Aegis Modernized Weapon System, NASA’s Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy, and Geostationary Weather Satellite development, among others. The goal of IV&V is to examine the three following questions regarding software: Will the system do what it is supposed to do? Will the system not do what it is not supposed to do? Will the system perform as expected under adverse conditions? IV&V is required to examine software on all projects with a life cycle cost over $1 billion, other projects over $250 million with a higher risk classification, or those specifically selected by the NASA Chief, Safety and Mission Assurance. Once selected, a portfolio-based risk assessment is developed to identify top-level mission capabilities and a risk based assessment process identifies the most important system capabilities and the software components that play the most important role in the mission. IV&V officials noted that due to limited resources, they examine mission and safety critical software and they do not have the funding to examine all programs or projects across NASA’s portfolio. Generally, IV&V officials stated that they believe JWST’s software development is going well, but the testing that lies ahead—when the different components are integrated—will be a challenge. For example, IV&V officials noted that JWST’s software build is the largest they have reviewed for a science mission, but not the largest they have reviewed across NASA as some Human Exploration Operations are larger. They said that most of JWST’s software required to position and deploy the telescope will be examined by IV&V. However, they noted that JWST’s integration is more challenging, primarily due to the number of software developers involved. While most science programs or projects have two to four software developers, JWST has eight. JWST’s software development has been examined by IV&V since fiscal year 2004 and, according to officials, will likely continue to be examined until after launch when operations begin. IV&V officials said they do not examine the software for the launch vehicle. While IV&V’s function requires independence from programs and projects, there have been recent changes in funding that have reduced its financial independence to some extent. Organizationally, the IV&V Facility remains independent by reporting to the Office of the Director of Goddard and the Office of Safety and Mission Assurance at NASA Headquarters— not to the programs or projects it examines. However, financially, starting in 2015, an IV&V financial management official said that 75 percent of the IV&V’s funding came from NASA Headquarters via the Agency Management Operations fund and the remaining 25 percent was divided amongst the various mission directorates. This changed from the past 10 years, when 100 percent of the IV&V Facility’s budget came from the Agency Management Operations to ensure the independence of the IV&V office. We have previously found that financial independence requires that the funding for IV&V be controlled by an organization separate from the development organization. This ensures that the effort will not be curtailed by having its funding diverted to other program needs, and that financial pressures cannot be used to influence the effort. As a user of IV&V’s expertise, JWST, via the use of program cost reserves, contributed a small portion of funding to the software IV&V facility to help fund their budget in fiscal year 2015. While this financial situation was new in fiscal year 2015, we will continue to monitor how NASA deals with funding the IV&V facility in the future to protect its independence. The JWST project has made progress building, integrating, and testing significant portions of JWST in the past year within the commitments made at the time of the 2011 replan for both schedule and cost. With the third major integration and test period starting in 2016, resolving technical challenges in a timely manner, and ensuring the OTIS test goes smoothly are key to continued progress within the project’s schedule commitment. Additionally, reducing the size of Northrop Grumman’s workforce and controlling costs within the fiscal year 2016 budget will be key metrics to monitor to demonstrate the project can meet requirements within its cost commitment. In the past, the project has benefited from independent expertise, information, and recommendations to improve the management of the project. Moving forward, the project may benefit from having more reliable data provided from its contractors to ensure that its EACs, which take into account risks and threats, are better able to inform its cost status. While the contractors were able to explain the anomalies, most had not been previously identified or documented. NASA used the data for its analyses, which subsequently raised questions about the reliability of those analyses. Making management decisions using unreliable data can result in bad decision making and can misinform the project on its long-term financial position which may have significant consequences if not corrected. We recommended in our December 2014 report that NASA conduct a cost risk analysis and follow best practices, which include updating it as risks change during the life of the program. Because the project is not going to conduct another cost risk analysis, putting independent surveillance in place to improve the accuracy of its risk- adjusted analysis—despite its weaknesses relative to the information a cost risk analysis provides—will provide better information to inform its decision making. In November 2012, we recommended that NASA improve the reliability of project EVM data by requiring its major spaceflight projects to implement a formal surveillance program that ensured anomalies in contractor-delivered data and in-house monthly EVM reports were identified and explained. NASA partially concurred with this recommendation but has not taken steps to require surveillance on projects like JWST. However, we continue to believe that improving the surveillance on projects will help reduce data anomalies from occurring like the ones we identified on JWST, resulting in better information and analyses to inform project decision making. To resolve contractor data reliability issues and ensure that the project obtains reliable data to inform its analyses and overall cost position, we recommend that the NASA Administrator direct JWST project officials to require the contractors to identify, explain, and document all anomalies in contractor-delivered monthly earned value management reports. We provided a draft of this report to NASA for comment. In written comments, NASA agreed with our recommendation. These comments are reprinted in appendix IV. NASA also provided technical comments, which have been addressed in the report, as appropriate. We are sending copies of the report to NASA’s Administrator and interested congressional committees. In addition, the report will be available at no charge on GAO’s website at http://www.gao.gov. Should you or your staff have any questions on matters discussed in this report, please contact me at (202) 512-4841 or chaplainc@gao.gov. Contact points for our Offices of Congressional Relations and Public Affairs may be found on the last page of this report. GAO staff who made major contributions to this report are listed in appendix V. Our objectives were to assess (1) the extent to which technical challenges have impacted the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) project’s ability to meet its schedule commitments, (2) the current cost status of the JWST project and the primary challenges that may influence the project’s ability to meet its future cost commitments, and (3) the extent to which independent oversight provides insight about project risks to management. To assess the extent to which technical challenges have impacted the JWST project’s ability to meet its schedule commitments, we reviewed project and contractor schedule documentation, and held interviews with program, project, and contractor officials on the progress made and challenges faced building the different components of the telescope. We examined and analyzed monthly JWST project status reports to management to monitor schedule reserve levels and usage and potential risks and technical challenges that may impact the project’s schedule, and to gain insights on the project’s progress since our last report in December 2014. Further, we attended flight program reviews at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) headquarters on a quarterly basis where the current status of the program was briefed to NASA headquarters officials outside of the project. We examined selected individual risks for elements and major subsystems from monthly risk registers prepared by the project to understand the likelihood of occurrence and impacts to the schedule based on steps the project is taking to mitigate the risks. We examined previous and current test schedules and plans to understand the sequence, what risks will be mitigated, which risks will continue, and any reductions to planned testing. Furthermore, we interviewed experts within and outside of NASA to identify criteria, best practices, and metrics that may be used to assess the project’s progress in reducing risk or provide insight into the health of the project. Finally, we interviewed project officials at Goddard, contractor officials from the Harris Corporation, the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, the Space Telescope Science Institute, and different divisions of Northrop Grumman Aerospace Systems concerning technological challenges that have had an impact on schedule, and the project’s and contractor’s plans to address these challenges. To assess the current cost status of the JWST project and the primary challenges that may influence the project’s ability to meet its future cost commitments, we reviewed and analyzed program, project, contractor, and subcontractor data and documentation and held interviews with officials from these organizations. We reviewed JWST project status reports on cost issues to determine the risks that could impact cost. We analyzed contractor and subcontractor’s workforce plans against workforce actuals to determine whether contractors’ are meeting their workforce plans. We monitored and analyzed the status of program, and project cost reserves in current and future fiscal years to determine the project’s financial posture. We evaluated the cost risk analysis conducted by NASA of the remaining Northrop Grumman work to determine the extent to which all applicable best practices from GAO’s Cost Estimating and Assessment Guide were used to build the analysis. Those best practices included the following: A probability distribution modeled each cost element’s uncertainty based on data availability, reliability, and variability. The correlation between cost elements was accounted for to capture risk. A Monte Carlo simulation model was used to develop a distribution of total possible costs and an S curve showing alternative cost estimate probabilities. The probability associated with the point estimate was identified. Contingency reserves were recommended for achieving the desired confidence level. The risk-adjusted cost estimate was allocated, phased, and converted to then year dollars for budgeting, and high-risk elements were identified to mitigate risks. A risk management plan was implemented jointly with the contractor to identify and analyze risk, plan for risk mitigation, and continually track risks. We examined and analyzed earned value management (EVM) data from two of the project’s contractors to identify trends in performance, whether tasks were completed as planned, and likely estimates at completion. We also conducted analysis to ensure the reliability of the data over a 17- month period. In addition, we examined and analyzed risk-adjusted analyses from NASA to determine what information they provide to the project, the risks incorporated, their reliability, and how the project is utilizing this information. We also discussed our assessment of the project’s data and analysis with program and project officials to obtain their input. To assess the extent to which independent oversight provides insight about project risks to management, we reviewed documentation and data from NASA relevant groups, the program, the project, and the Standing Review Board and held interviews with experts as well as officials from independent oversight entities. We analyzed NASA policy and guidance documents to understand the elements for setting up and managing a Standing Review Board. We also reviewed the Test Assessment Team and Independent Comprehensive Review Panel team reports to determine how independent oversight has provided insight to JWST in the past. We interviewed officials at NASA’s Independent Program Assessment Office, as well as past and current Standing Review Board members, to understand how Standing Review Boards are created, members are selected, and how structural and personnel changes are made over the life of NASA programs and projects, including JWST. We also interviewed and reviewed documentation and analysis provided by NASA’s Independent Verification and Validation group working on JWST’s software development to determine the extent to which this group is providing oversight of JWST software development, to determine the health of software development on JWST, and determine what kinds of problems remain. We did not independently review JWST’s software development. Our work was performed primarily at NASA headquarters in Washington, D.C.; Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland; the Independent Verification and Validation facility in Fairmont, West Virginia; and by video teleconference with officials from the Independent Program Assessment Office at Langley Research Center, Hampton, Virginia. We also visited the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California; Northrop Grumman Aerospace Systems in Redondo Beach, California; and the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore, Maryland. We conducted this performance audit from February 2015 to December 2015 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. Appendix III: Organizational Chart for the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) Program The Jet Propulsion Laboratory is the contractor for the development of the cryocooler, but has subcontracted most of the work to a different division of Northrop Grumman than the one that is responsible for OTE, spacecraft, and sunshield development.

With significant integration and testing scheduled in the 3 remaining years until the planned launch date, the JWST project will need to continue to address many challenges and identify problems, many likely to be revealed during its rigorous testing to come. The continued success of JWST hinges on NASA's ability to anticipate, identify, and respond to these challenges in a timely and cost-effective manner to meet its commitments. Conference Report 112-284 included a provision for GAO to assess the project annually and report on its progress. This is the fourth such report. This report assesses (1) the extent to which JWST is meeting its schedule commitments and (2) the current cost status of the project, among other issues. To conduct this work, GAO reviewed monthly JWST reports, reviewed relevant policies, conducted independent analysis of NASA and contractor data, and interviewed NASA and contractor officials. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration's (NASA) James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) project is meeting its schedule commitments, but it will soon face some of its most challenging integration and testing. JWST currently has almost 9 months of schedule reserve—down more than 2 months since GAO's last report in December 2014—but still above its schedule plan and the Goddard Space Flight Center requirement. However, as GAO also found in December 2014, all JWST elements and major subsystems continue to remain within weeks of becoming the critical path—the schedule with the least amount of schedule reserve—for the overall project. Given their proximity to the critical path, the use of additional reserve on any element or major subsystem may reduce the overall project schedule reserve. Before the planned launch in October 2018, the project must complete five major integration and test events, three of which have not yet begun. Integration and testing is when problems are often identified and schedules tend to slip. At the same time, the project must also address over 100 technical risks and ensure that potential areas for mission failure are fully tested and understood. JWST continues to meet its cost commitments, but unreliable contractor performance data may pose a risk to project management. To help manage the project and account for new risks, project officials conducted a cost risk analysis of the prime contract. A cost risk analysis uses information about cost drivers, technical issues, and schedule to determine the reliability of a program's cost estimates. GAO found that while NASA's cost risk analysis substantially met best practices for cost estimating, officials do not plan to periodically update it. Instead, the project is using a risk-adjusted analysis to update and inform its cost position, but this analysis is a simplified version of a cost risk analysis—and not a replacement—and is based on contractor-provided performance data that contains anomalies that render the data unreliable. Further, the project does not have an independent surveillance mechanism, such as the Defense Contract Management Agency, to help ensure data anomalies are corrected by the contractor before being incorporated into larger cost analyses, as GAO recommended in 2012. As a result, the project is relying partially on unreliable information to inform its decision making and overall cost status. GAO recommends that the JWST project require contractors to identify, explain, and document anomalies in contractor-delivered monthly earned value management reports. GAO continues to believe that its 2012 recommendation to implement formal surveillance to help improve the reliability of contractor-provided data has merit and should be implemented. NASA concurred with the recommendation made in this report.",govreport
"Franchise funds are government-run, self-supporting businesslike enterprises managed by federal employees. Franchise funds provide a variety of common administrative services, such as payroll processing, information technology support, employee assistance programs, public relations, and contracting. This review focuses on DOD’s use of the franchise funds’ contracting services. Franchise funds are required to recover their full costs of doing business and are allowed to retain up to 4 percent of their total annual income. To cover their costs, the franchise funds charge fees for services. The Government Management Reform Act of 1994 authorized the Office of Management and Budget to designate six federal agencies to establish the franchise fund pilot program. Congress anticipated that the franchise funds would be able to provide common administrative services more efficiently than federal agencies’ own personnel. The original operating principles for franchise funds included offering services on a fully competitive basis, using a comprehensive set of performance measures to assess the quality of franchise fund services, and establishing cost and performance benchmarks against their competitors—other government organizations providing the same types of services. Although there are five franchise funds currently in operation, DOD primarily uses two for contracting services—GovWorks, operated by the Department of the Interior, and FedSource, operated by the Department of the Treasury. Figure 1 shows the revenues for GovWorks and FedSource and the percentage of revenue derived from doing business with DOD in fiscal year 2004. Effective contract management requires specialized knowledge and careful attention to a range of regulatory requirements and contracting practices designed to protect the government’s interests. In obtaining contracting services through a franchise fund, three main parties share responsibilities for ensuring that proper procedures are followed: government customer—the program office or agency in need of a good or service; franchise fund—the federal entity that provides contracting services; and contractor—the vendor that provides the good or service desired by the government customer. DOD program officials are most familiar with the technical requirements for the goods and services they need. DOD contracting officers can place orders directly through many interagency contracts. Alternatively, DOD pays the franchise fund to assume many of the contracting responsibilities that normally would have been handled by DOD’s contracting officers if the customers had relied on them to purchase the goods or services. Whether DOD makes purchases directly or through another agency, regulatory procedures and requirements are the same, such as ensuring competition, determining fair and reasonable pricing, and monitoring contractor performance. Table 1 shows the basic steps to acquire a good or service through GovWorks or FedSource. GovWorks and FedSource can either make use of their own or other agencies’ contracts, or they can develop new, customized contracts to satisfy a DOD customer’s needs. GovWorks generally uses other agencies’ contracts, and FedSource generally uses its own contracts. Table 2 lists the various types of contracting methods the franchise funds use. While use of other agencies’ contracting services may offer convenience and efficiency, our prior work and that of some agency inspectors general have identified problems with the use of other agencies’ contracting services, including lack of compliance with federal requirements for competition and lack of contractor oversight. In prior work, we found that increasing demands on the acquisition workforce and insufficient training and guidance are among the causes for these deficiencies. Two additional factors are worth noting. First, the fee-for-service arrangement creates an incentive to increase sales volume because revenue growth supports growth of the organization. This incentive can lead to an inordinate focus on meeting customer demands at the expense of complying with contracting policy and required procedures. Second, it is not always clear where the responsibility lies for such critical functions as describing requirements, negotiating terms, and conducting oversight. Several parties—the government customer, the agencies providing the contracting services, and, in some cases, the contractors—are involved with these functions. But, as the number of parties grows, so too does the need to ensure accountability. We have previously reported that ensuring the proper execution of the contracting process is a shared responsibility of all parties involved in the acquisition process and that specific responsibilities need to be more clearly defined. GovWorks and FedSource did not always obtain the full benefits of competitive procedures, did not otherwise ensure fair and reasonable prices, and may have missed opportunities to achieve savings on behalf of DOD customers for millions of dollars worth of goods and services. With limited evidence that prices were fair and reasonable, GovWorks sometimes added millions of dollars of work to existing orders—as high as 20 times the original order value. In addition, we found limited and inconsistent evidence in the GovWorks and FedSource contract files we reviewed that the franchise funds sought to negotiate prices or conducted price analysis when required. DOD customers told us they were under the impression that franchise funds ensure competition and analyze prices. However, we found numerous cases in which these practices did not occur. The FAR states that contracting officers must purchase goods and services from responsible sources at fair and reasonable prices. Price competition is the preferred method to ensure that prices are fair and reasonable. The FAR also includes special competition procedures for orders placed under the types of contracts the franchise funds use, including GSA schedules and multiple-award contracts. DOD’s procurement regulations have additional procedures for ensuring competition when purchasing services from these types of contracts with certain exceptions—such as urgency or logical follow-on. For example, when ordering from GSA schedules, DOD procurement regulations require contracting officers to request proposals from as many contractors as practicable and receive at least three offers. If three offers are not received, a contracting officer must determine in writing that no additional contractors can fulfill the requirement. Alternatively, the contracting officer may provide notice to all schedule holders that could fulfill the requirement. When prices for the specific services being ordered are not established in the contract, the FAR and GSA ordering procedures require contracting officers to analyze proposed prices and to document that they are determined to be fair and reasonable. For example, when labor rates are established in the contract, relying on labor rates alone is not a good basis for deciding which contractor is the most competitive. The labor rates do not reflect the full cost of the order or critical aspects of the service being provided, such as the number of hours and mix of labor skill categories needed to perform the work. These procedures are designed to ensure that the government’s interests are protected when purchasing goods and services. We reviewed 10 orders—totaling about $164 million in fiscal year 2003 funding—in which GovWorks provided contracting services to DOD’s customers. With the exception of two orders, which were placed against GovWorks’ own contracts, the orders we reviewed were placed against GSA schedules. In 5 of the 10 cases, GovWorks sought, but did not receive, competing proposals as required for the types of contracts used. In 3 of the 10 cases, GovWorks sought and received multiple proposals for the work. In the remaining 2 cases, GovWorks placed orders on a sole-source or single-source basis and provided relevant explanations, such as an urgent need for the work and an award to a small disadvantaged business. Table 3 provides details on these 10 orders, and additional information is available in appendix I. In the five cases for which GovWorks sought competing proposals but received only one proposal for each order, GovWorks allowed 2 weeks or less for proposals to be submitted. In four of these cases, orders were ultimately placed with incumbent contractors to fill requirements for ongoing programs. For example, when the Air Force’s Office of the Deputy Chief of Staff Air and Space Operations sought a contractor to provide analytical services, GovWorks gave potential contractors 4 days—around Christmas—to respond. The one contractor that responded was the incumbent and received the order, which totaled $63.4 million. When the Air Force’s Aging Landing Gear Life Extension Program needed a contractor to provide services involving landing gear technology, GovWorks invited 17 contractors to submit proposals and posted the solicitation on the Internet allowing 14 days for proposals to be submitted. The incumbent contractor, which had provided services to the program since its inception in 1998, submitted the only proposal and received the order, which totaled $19.8 million. Each of these 5 orders was subject to the standards for obtaining competing offers for DOD orders, but in only the case of the Aging Landing Gear Life Extension Program did contract documentation indicate that GovWorks had attempted to meet Defense procurement regulations for ordering from GSA schedules. Our findings at GovWorks are consistent with our previous work on DOD’s use of other agencies’ contracts. In our prior work we found that the reasons only one contractor responded to opportunities to compete for work included a perception among potential contractors that incumbent contractors have an advantage in competing for ongoing work and that very short time frames to prepare proposals discouraged others from competing. In this review, we found GovWorks received multiple proposals for work when there was no incumbent contractor and longer time frames allowed for competition to occur. In the five cases in which competing proposals were sought but not obtained, we found limited evidence of price analyses in GovWorks’ contract files. In four of these cases, orders were subject to GSA ordering procedures for services requiring a statement of work. In the fifth case, an Interior multiple-award contract, the FAR required price analysis. (See table 3.) Consequently, GovWorks should have determined that the total price was fair and reasonable. GovWorks told us that it had conducted analyses, but we found that the files generally included only brief statements that prices had been determined reasonable, and GovWorks generally could not provide us with documentation showing what data had been gathered or analyses conducted to support the conclusion for the cases we reviewed. In 6 of the 10 cases we reviewed, GovWorks added substantial work beyond what was originally planned without determining that prices were fair and reasonable. For example, GovWorks increased an original order 20-fold by adding $45.5 million for management consulting services for the National Guard Bureau Chief Information Office. GovWorks modified another National Guard order on numerous occasions, this time increasing the value of the original order for an automated information system from $17.6 million to $44.6 million. An order for reconnaissance and surveillance flight support to Army combatant commands increased in value from $7.4 million to $34.9 million. The order was intended to provide support in Bosnia, for a period of 15 months with no option to renew, but was expanded to include operations in Colombia, and the period of performance was extended by more than 2 years. In each of these examples, GovWorks assigned the additional work without conducting price analyses to determine whether the prices charged were fair and reasonable. We reviewed seven FedSource projects—amounting to $85 million in fiscal year 2003—and found that the franchise fund did not compete orders it placed under multiple-award contracts or perform analyses to ensure fair and reasonable pricing. FedSource commonly used multiple-award contracts to make purchases for DOD. When placing orders against multiple-award contracts, DOD is generally required to ensure that contract holders have a fair opportunity to submit an offer and have that offer fairly considered for each order with certain exceptions—such as urgency or logical follow-on. In addition, FedSource used Blanket Purchase Agreements and requirements contracts for some of the projects we reviewed. Table 4 provides detail on the seven projects, and additional information is available in appendix I. The FedSource business model involves a two-step process of placing an order under previously awarded contracts and subsequently developing work assignments to define requirements for that order. In the first step, contracting officers issue orders indicating the type and approximate dollar value of work that FedSource anticipates will be required under each contract. This estimated value is based on historical usage. The second step is executed later when DOD identifies its needs. At this point, FedSource administrative personnel define tasks and outcomes and assign work to a contractor. In our past work, we recommended that the FAR clarify that agencies should not award large, undefined orders against multiple-award contracts and subsequently define specific tasks. The FAR was revised to encourage agencies to define work clearly so that the total price for work could be established at the time orders are issued. Although this requirement was in effect for the period of our review, we found that FedSource routinely allowed modifications to orders through work assignments that substantially increased the total price of the orders. FedSource did not provide contractors the opportunity to submit offers for orders under multiple-award contracts and have their offers fairly considered, as required by the FAR. FedSource officials told us that their business model does not provide contractors the opportunity to submit offers on orders. Instead, FedSource officials told us that administrative personnel were responsible for providing contractors a fair opportunity to be considered for work under multiple-award contract orders when assigning specific work to contractors. However, we found this generally did not occur. Of the 120 work assignments we reviewed, 75 were for work under multiple-award contracts. We found that in most of the 75 work assignments, FedSource administrative personnel did not provide contractors this opportunity. For example, FedSource used one of these contracts to fill several individual support staff positions at Brooke Army Medical Center at Fort Sam Houston and generally assigned work to one of the three multiple-award contractors without providing the other two contractors an opportunity to be considered. Justifications accompanying these assignments stated that assigning work to more than one contractor might create conflict among assigned staff over variations in pay and benefits. The Army’s Fort McCoy used FedSource to obtain contractor support for a variety of construction projects, and FedSource assigned the work noncompetitively for all 12 work assignments we reviewed to 1 of 3 multiple-award contract holders—totaling $7.2 million. The contract holder, a firm specializing in staffing, subsequently passed the work through to local construction companies that Fort McCoy officials had identified. Justifications accompanying some of the projects stated that the FedSource contracting officer’s representative had determined that it was “in the best interest of the government to award task orders to the vendor that solicited and brought in the business.” A FedSource quality review later concluded that these justifications were inadequate. Many months after the assignments were made, a second justification was placed in the contract files citing numerous reasons for selecting the preferred contractor. One of the reasons was that the project required expedited effort to support urgent requirements, which might have been an acceptable reason, except that the justification did not indicate that use of the other two contractors would have resulted in unacceptable delays. In another example, the Navy needed to fill several administrative positions at its 31 regional recruiting centers around the country. Under another purchasing arrangement, FedSource assigned the work to two contractors, one for recruiting centers east of the Mississippi River and the other for centers to the west of the river. These arrangements did not establish prices for any of the services provided, and FedSource personnel told us that they accepted the prices provided by the contractors. This type of purchasing arrangement does not justify purchasing from only one source—contracting officers are still required to solicit price quotations from other sources. However, there was no evidence FedSource personnel had negotiated or analyzed these prices. In addition, FedSource did not always demonstrate that prices were reasonable. For example, in two of the customer projects we reviewed, FedSource made work assignments for construction services at the Army’s Fort McCoy and Fort Snelling against a contract for operational support. Because the original contract had a very broad and undefined statement of work that did not explicitly include construction, no prices for that type of work had been established in the contract. For the project at Fort McCoy, the contractor that received the assignment solicited prices from potential subcontractors and presented their price, including a markup, to FedSource. We did not find any analysis to determine that the contractor’s price was reasonable in FedSource’s files. FedSource officials told us that they have since awarded a separate contract for construction services. In four of the five projects involving staffing support, FedSource paid contractors higher prices for services than were established in the contract. Most of the files we reviewed contained no justifications for the higher prices. For example, in our review of 25 work assignments for staffing support services at an Army medical center, 14 of the work assignments were priced higher than the price established in the contracts. In 9 of these cases, FedSource had agreed to additional sick leave or vacation time as part of the hourly rate, but FedSource’s contract file contained no documentation indicating that the contractor employee qualified for the additional benefits. DOD did not follow sound management practices designed to ensure value while expeditiously acquiring goods and services. DOD customers chose to use franchise funds based on convenience, rather than as part of an acquisition plan. DOD conducted little analysis, if any, to determine whether using franchise funds’ contracting services was the best method for acquiring a particular good or service. For their part, although franchise funds’ business operating principles require that they maintain and evaluate cost and performance benchmarks against their competitors, they did not perform analyses that DOD could use to assess whether the franchise funds deliver good value. Their performance measures generally focus on customer satisfaction and generating revenues, rather than proper use of contracts and sound management practices. This focus on customer satisfaction and generating revenues provides an incentive to emphasize customer service rather than ensuring proper use of contracts and good value. DOD customers told us that they did not formally analyze contracting alternatives but generally chose to pay GovWorks and FedSource to provide contracting services because the franchise funds provided quick and convenient service. Some customers were dissatisfied with the speed and quality of services provided by DOD’s in-house contracting offices. For example, two DOD customers told us that their contracting offices required 9 months to respond to their purchasing needs, while the franchise fund required only a few weeks. The franchise fund’s ability to place orders quickly was valuable to DOD customers in these situations. DOD customers said that franchise funds’ contracting services were less restrictive than other DOD contracting alternatives. Some DOD customers told us that GovWorks and FedSource made it easier to spend funds at the end of a fiscal year unlike DOD’s in-house contracting offices. Two DOD customers said that GovWorks made it easier to spend small amounts of funding because GovWorks would place orders incrementally as funding became available. Some DOD customers mentioned that using FedSource meant they did not have to “live with the terms and conditions” of a long term contract or that it was easier to replace problem contractor employees. In one case, we were told that, if the organization had to fill positions with government employees, it would have less flexibility to hire the personnel it needed in a timely manner. Analysis of contracting alternatives helps to ensure that purchases are made by the most appropriate means and are in DOD’s best interest; however, DOD has no clear mechanism for making this determination when using other agencies’ contracting services. DOD’s guidance on the use of these vehicles has been evolving for several years and has not yet been fully implemented. DOD also lacks a means to gather data on the use of interagency contracts on a recurring basis, although it has been subject over the years to various requirements to monitor interagency purchases. In 2003, in response to a congressional mandate, DOD was unable to compile complete data on spending through interagency contracts. DOD officials told us that their financial systems are not designed to collect this data. Without this type of data, it is difficult to make informed decisions about the use of other agencies’ contracting services. DOD issued guidance in October 2004 that requires the military departments and defense agencies to determine whether using interagency contracts—such as those the franchise funds manage—is in DOD’s best interest. While this guidance outlines procedures to be developed, and general factors to consider, it does not provide specific criteria for how to make this determination and does not require military departments and agencies to report on the use of interagency contracts. DOD has directed the military departments and defense agencies to develop their own guidance to implement this policy. Congress has also recently taken action to ensure DOD’s proper use of interagency contracts. The conference report accompanying this legislation established expectations that DOD’s procedures will ensure that any fees paid by DOD to the contracting agency are reasonable in relation to work actually performed. In 2001, Congress adopted legislation requiring DOD to establish a management structure and establishing savings goals for the procurement of services. The legislation also requires DOD to ensure that contracts for services are entered into or issued and managed in compliance with applicable laws and regulations regardless of whether the services are procured by DOD directly or through a non-DOD contract or task order. One of the goals of this legislation was to allow DOD to improve the management of the procurement of services. However, DOD generally chose to use franchise funds for reasons of speed, convenience, and flexibility rather than taking a strategic and coordinated approach to acquiring services. We found that prior to choosing to use a franchise fund, DOD did not analyze costs and benefits or prepare business cases to determine whether the franchise fund provided better value—considering the fees it charges—compared with other alternatives, such as using a DOD contracting office or purchasing goods or services through another federal agency’s existing contract. As a result, DOD customers did not consider opportunities to leverage their buying power when using franchise funds. None of the DOD customers we spoke to analyzed trade- offs between total price, including fees, and the benefits of convenience. For example, on a group of work assignments for construction services valued at $7.2 million, the Army’s Fort McCoy paid FedSource a total of about $1 million, or 17 percent above the subcontractor’s proposed price, for the contractor markup and the franchise fund fee. Most of these assignments were placed towards the end of the fiscal year. This may have led to a higher price for the services than DOD would have paid in contracting directly with the subcontractors. Figure 2 shows the general process by which the Army’s Fort McCoy used FedSource to obtain contractor support for construction services. The DOD customer said that FedSource made it easier than his own contracting office to assign work with values greater that $25,000 late in the fiscal year because FedSource’s deadlines were not as strict. He also speculated that the subcontractor probably would have charged more if contracting directly with the government because dealing with the government is cumbersome and costly. He did not have information to indicate what the subcontractor’s price might have been, nor did he perform any formal analysis to compare FedSource with other contracting opportunities. Conducting a thorough analysis also might have given DOD a better understanding of the fees paid to make purchases through the franchise funds. For example, DOD customers sometimes paid a GovWorks fee, or service charge, on top of a fee to use another agency’s contract because GovWorks generally uses other agencies’ contracts to make purchases for DOD customers. While some customers were aware of the fees they paid, in two cases, DOD customers selected GovWorks because its fees were lower than fees charged by other agencies; however, the customers did not realize that GovWorks’ fees were in addition to the other agencies’ fees. GovWorks’ fees generally ranged from 2 percent to 4 percent of the price for goods and services purchased, and our analysis showed that FedSource fees ranged from 2 percent to 8 percent for the contracts and orders we reviewed. Congress has mandated that DOD agencies report fees paid for the use of other agencies’ contracts in the past and required DOD to do so again for fiscal year 2005. The franchise funds’ business operating principles require that they maintain and evaluate cost and performance benchmarks against their competitors. However, they did not perform analyses that DOD could use to assess whether the franchise funds deliver good value. FedSource claims that it achieves lower prices on goods and services because it aggregates requirements and negotiates price discounts. Further, FedSource claims that competition with other contracting offices provides an incentive to provide better quality at lower cost. However, this incentive may not drive costs down unless customers are sensitive to the cost of doing business with one agency over another and make decisions based on costs. Franchise fund officials told us that demonstrating these advantages was difficult because they lacked insight into the prices customers would have paid when using other contracting alternatives to fill their requirements. FedSource officials also explained that quantifying the value of the other benefits they provide—such as convenience and flexibility—is difficult. Instead, GovWorks and FedSource have used such measures as growth in total contracting activity and revenues as well as customer satisfaction but have little data to demonstrate that they provide better quality and lower price goods and services than other federal contracting alternatives can provide. In fact, GovWorks marketing materials emphasize convenience and value-added service rather than costs. In our prior work, we found that fee-for-service contracting arrangements emphasize the overall sustainability of the contracting operation, as the fees collected are used to cover the costs of doing business, which may lead to a focus on customer service at the expense of compliance with contracting policy and procedures. DOD, GovWorks, and FedSource did not follow federal contracting procedures designed to ensure value while expeditiously acquiring goods and services. DOD and the franchise funds did not define desired outcomes and the specific criteria against which contractor performance could be measured and paid limited attention to monitoring contractors’ work. As we have reported previously, it is not always clear where the responsibility lies for such critical functions as describing requirements, negotiating terms, and conducting oversight. Although the FAR states that contracting officers are responsible for including appropriate quality requirements in solicitations and contracts and for contract surveillance, the franchise funds do not have sufficient knowledge about the DOD customers’ needs to fulfill these responsibilities without the assistance of the DOD customer. Recently, the franchise funds contracting operations performed some internal reviews that have findings similar to ours, and the funds are working to address the problems. These shortcomings mirror many of the findings of our previous work and are among the reasons we have designated interagency contracting as a governmentwide high-risk area. In the GovWorks and FedSource cases we reviewed, required outcomes were not well-defined, work was generally described in broad terms, and orders sometimes specifically indicated that work would be defined more fully after the order was placed. GovWorks and FedSource files we reviewed lacked clear descriptions of outcomes to be achieved or requirements that the contractor was supposed to meet. The FAR states that contracting officers are responsible for including the appropriate quality requirements in solicitations and contracts. Without these criteria, accountability becomes harder to determine and the risk of poor performance is increased. Clear definition of requirements promotes better mutual understanding of the government’s needs. In a typical situation, the customer—a DOD program office, for example—is best qualified to know what it needs. However, once a DOD program office chooses to pay a franchise fund to make purchases on its behalf, the office must then rely on the franchise fund to provide the contracting expertise. The two parties have to work together to ensure that requirements for purchases are well-defined with sufficient detail to determine whether the desired outcomes were met and the goods and services provided meet the government’s needs. Critical information must be documented in order to make these determinations. GovWorks and FedSource use different processes, and the tables in appendix III explain some of the pertinent contract documents used to define desired outcomes and criteria. In 7 of the 10 GovWorks orders we reviewed, statements of work were very broad. For example, six of these orders contained language stating that specific tasks could be added, deleted, or redefined throughout the period of performance. In some cases, DOD program officials told us that the statements of work were broad because they were not aware of all requirements when the order was placed or because they were operating in a constantly changing technological environment. DOD program officials also told us that the broad statements of work gave them flexibility to add requirements to existing orders as additional needs arose. Orders placed by FedSource against its contracts contained only a very general statement—generally just a few words—describing the work in broad terms and an anticipated dollar value. These orders did not clearly describe all services to be performed or supplies to be delivered so that the full price for the work could be established when the order was placed, as required by the FAR. As noted earlier, FedSource officials explained that in their business model, orders were not intended to describe specific work to be completed. Instead, FedSource administrative personnel issued work assignments that were intended to provide the clear descriptions of desired outcomes that the orders did not. However, we found that these work assignments were often unclear as well. Five of FedSource’s largest customer projects for DOD involved use of contracts to provide staff. Work assignments for staffing services often described the position to be filled, including a general outline of duties. However, the assignments did not contain criteria for evaluating the work performed by contract employees. In addition, when providing staffing support, FedSource uses these contracts to fill positions individually, rather than describing functional needs or desired results. For example, at an Army medical center FedSource filled over 200 positions individually instead of aggregating these positions into fewer functional requirements. This acquisition approach does not provide contractors with the flexibility to determine how best to staff a function and does not lend itself to a performance- based approach. Under performance-based contracting, the contracting agency specifies the outcome or result it desires and leaves it to the contractor to decide how best to achieve the desired outcome. FedSource officials said they were moving toward a more performance- based contracting approach. To determine whether an environment had been created that would allow improper personal services relationships to develop, we interviewed officials at five DOD program offices that used FedSource contracts to staff individual positions. We asked questions about the work performed by the contractor employees and the relationships between the DOD customers and the contractor employees. The DOD officials said that generally: the services provided by the contract employee were integral to agency functions or missions; the contractor employees were providing services comparable to those performed using civil service personnel; and the services were provided on site and with the use of equipment provided by the government. With regard to the work relationships, DOD customers told us that government employees assigned and prioritized daily tasks for the contractor employees. FedSource guidelines also state that the government customer is responsible for verifying contract employee hours worked by signing the contractor’s weekly timesheet. Further, a FedSource internal review found that statements of work contained “personal services-type language like ‘under the direction of’ or ‘oversee’ or ‘duties’ or ‘job description.’” Our review also found documents that had been edited to revise similar language. FedSource officials were aware of the potential that these contracts might be used for personal services and took various steps to clarify that personal services were not to be provided. For example, FedSource officials provided training for DOD customers on how to avoid creating a situation that had the appearance of personal services. Although this training is a positive step, poorly defined statements of work provided the opportunity for situations to arise in which personal services relationships could develop. FedSource relied on administrative staff, not contracting officers, to work with the customer to define and assign the specific tasks to be performed or the positions to be filled. A FedSource review found that trained contracting staff was needed for developing task order requirements and warranted contracting officers were required for issuing task orders. The FedSource administrative employees do not have the same level of expertise as contracting officers, who have specialized knowledge to ensure compliance with federal regulations and guidelines. Inadequacies we found in FedSource’s contracting practices pointed to the challenges of relying on administrative personnel rather than contracting experts to review statements of work, choose appropriate contracting vehicles, ensure adequate competition, and sign off on assignments of specific work. DOD customers, GovWorks, and FedSource often relied on methods of contract oversight that lacked performance measures to ensure that contractors provided quality goods and services in a timely manner. Typically, the franchise funds failed to include an oversight plan that contained specific quality criteria in their contracts or orders. Without this critical information, neither DOD nor the franchise funds could effectively measure contractor performance. The FAR and DOD’s procurement regulations require contract surveillance and documentation that it occurred. Contract surveillance, also referred to as oversight, is a contracting officer’s responsibility, and DOD pays the franchise fund to assume the responsibilities of contracting officers. The Office of Management and Budget’s Office of Federal Procurement Policy has issued policy stating that contract oversight begins with the assignment of trained personnel who conduct surveillance throughout the performance period of the contract to ensure the government receives the services required by the contract. DOD guidance states that documentation constitutes an official record and the surveillance personnel assessing performance are to use a checklist to record their observations of the contractor’s performance. The guidance also states that all performance should be documented whether it is acceptable or not. The GovWorks contract files we reviewed generally did not include contractor monitoring plans, quality assurance surveillance plans, test and acceptance plans, or other evidence of monitoring activities. However, the files did contain evidence that a contracting officer’s representative from the DOD program office had been appointed to assist in performing contractor oversight. Although ensuring that contract oversight occurs is a contracting officer responsibility, GovWorks officials told us that surveillance plans were not usually kept in the GovWorks contracting officers’ contract files. Instead, these plans were maintained by the contracting officer’s representative at the DOD customer agency. When we asked about contract oversight, we found that in the absence of an agreed upon oversight plan, DOD customers generally ensured that there was some process in place for monitoring performance. Some customers described status meetings and regular progress reports, but generally told us that they had no specific criteria for monitoring contractor performance or established measures for determining the quality of services. Although GovWorks officials told us that their contracting officers did assist customers in measuring quality services from the acquisition planning stages through contract completion, we found little evidence that this actually took place. We found that FedSource generally did not ensure that contractor oversight occurred. As was the case with GovWorks, FedSource officials told us that they encouraged DOD to develop criteria for quality. However, FedSource allowed general information—such as job descriptions—to serve as requirements, even though the job descriptions contained no criteria for measuring quality. These descriptions did not provide sufficient information to establish an oversight plan. FedSource did not appoint trained contracting officers’ representatives from DOD to conduct on-site monitoring. Instead, FedSource relied on its own administrative personnel, who had been trained as contracting officers’ technical representatives but were not located on-site with the customer, to assess contractor performance. Because they were not on-site, they could not observe the quality of the contractors’ work, and FedSource generally took the absence of complaints from DOD customers as an indication that the contractor was performing satisfactorily. A FedSource official explained that FedSource guidelines state that the customer agency’s acceptance of the contract employee’s time sheet indicates agreement that services have met quality standards and requirements. This policy lacks clear criteria and measures to determine whether the contractor has provided quality services. In place of criteria, we found DOD customers said they generally evaluated performance of contractor staff based on informal observation and customer satisfaction. The lack of adequate oversight is consistent with what we have reported in our recent work on contractor oversight for DOD service contracts, where we found that almost all of those that had insufficient oversight were interagency contracts. DOD explained that contractor oversight is not as important to contracting officials as awarding contracts and does not receive the priority needed to ensure that oversight occurs. DOD concurred with our recommendations to develop guidance on contractor oversight of services procured from other agencies’ contracts, to ensure that proper personnel be assigned to perform contractor oversight in a timely manner no later than the date of contract award, and that DOD’s service contract review process and associated data collection requirements provide information that will provide management visibility over contract oversight. Aside from monitoring the contractors’ performance, we also found that the departments of the Interior and the Treasury, which operate GovWorks and FedSource, respectively, and the Office of Management and Budget have conducted infrequent reviews of franchise funds’ procurement activities. GovWorks and FedSource have recently conducted internal reviews of their operations that have identified concerns similar to those we found. A GovWorks’ 2004 Management Review identified such issues as lack of acquisition planning for work added to existing awards, unanticipated increases in the amounts of orders, and inadequate documentation of many requirements such as competitive procedures, determinations that changes were within the scope of the contract, the basis of award decisions, and that prices were fair and reasonable. FedSource officials recently started conducting “office assistance reviews.” A June 2004 FedSource review identified lack of documentation, use of purchasing agreements beyond their intended parameters and dollar limits, lack of price analysis, lack of quality assurance plans, and the need for warranted contracting officers rather than administrative personnel to perform much of the work. While the operating principles for franchise funds require the funds to have comprehensive performance measures, these measures do not emphasize compliance with contracting regulations and generally focus on customer satisfaction, financial performance, and generating revenues to cover operating costs. Several customers we interviewed were unaware of compliance problems and told us that they believed the franchise funds placed orders on a competitive basis, analyzed prices, or otherwise sought to ensure the best deal for the government when the funds, in fact, did not. GovWorks has taken steps that address concerns raised in its own reviews, such as increased training for contracting officers, developing a written acquisition procedures manual, and creating a uniform system of contract file maintenance and sample documents to ensure adequate documentation. GovWorks officials also told us they are trying to improve competitive procedures by requiring all solicitations for DOD work to be posted on e-Buy, an online system to request quotes for products and services. FedSource also has taken steps toward addressing concerns raised in this report, such as quality assurance planning, hiring contracting officers, and restructuring its operations. These initiatives are underway, and it is too early to tell whether they will improve contracting operations at the franchise funds. The Office of Management and Budget’s oversight of franchise funds has been limited. The Office of Management and Budget and the Chief Financial Officers Council established business-operating principles as a foundation for effective franchise fund management and, as required by the Government Management Reform Act, submitted an interim report on the franchise fund pilot program to Congress in 1998. Among other efforts, the report recommended that the franchise funds should continue to seek opportunities to provide services at the least cost to the taxpayer, contributing to reducing duplicative administrative functions and consequently to the costs of those functions. The report noted that the franchise funds’ performance measures were in varying stages of development. The report recommended that the Office of Management and Budget should report to Congress on franchise fund activity prior to the expiration of the pilot authority and that the office should continue to develop and implement operating guidance for the franchise fund program. Although the Office of Management and Budget’s budget examiners conduct some monitoring of franchise funds as part of their general oversight responsibilities, Office of Management and Budget representatives said they have not conducted any comprehensive reviews of franchise funds since they submitted the required report to Congress. Neither have they reviewed the funds’ contracting practices. GovWorks and FedSource, created as a result of governmentwide initiatives to improve efficiency, have streamlined contracting processes to provide customers with greater flexibility and convenience. However, GovWorks and FedSource have not always adhered to competitive procedures and other sound contracting practices. They have paid insufficient attention to basic tenets of the federal procurement system— taxpayers’ dollars should be spent wisely, steps should be taken to ensure fair and reasonable prices, and purchases should be made in the best interest of the government. One factor contributing to these deficiencies is that the departments of the Interior and the Treasury have not ensured that the franchise funds’ contracting services follow the FAR and other procurement policies. The franchise funds need to develop clear, consistent, and enforceable policies and processes that comply with contracting regulations while maintaining good customer service. Another contributing factor is that the roles and responsibilities of the parties involved in the interagency contracting process are not always clearly defined. GovWorks and FedSource are ultimately accountable for compliance with procurement regulations when they assume the role of the contracting officer. However, they often depend on the customer for detailed information about the customer’s needs. To facilitate effective purchasing and to help obtain the best value of goods and services, all parties involved in the use of interagency contracts have a stake in clarifying roles and responsibilities. Additionally, franchise funds sometimes face incentives to provide good customer service at the expense of proper use of contracts and good value. These pressures are inherent in the fee-for-service contracting arrangement. Because the franchise funds have not always adhered to sound contracting practices, DOD customers must be cautious when deciding whether franchise fund contracting services are the best available alternative. In addition to convenience and flexibility, decisions to use franchise funds should be grounded in analysis of factors such as price and fees. Further, to enhance DOD’s ability to develop sound policies related to the use of franchise funds, DOD needs measurable data that would allow it to assess whether franchise funds’ contracting services help lower contract prices, reduce administrative costs, and improve the delivery of goods and services. This information would also be useful in leveraging DOD’s overall buying power through strategic acquisition planning. No one knows the total cost of using other agencies’ contracting services. Without understanding total cost, value is elusive. In addition, DOD customers should ensure that taxpayers’ dollars are spent wisely by sharing in the responsibilities for developing clear contract requirements and oversight mechanisms. DOD customers are the best source of information about their specific needs and are also best positioned to oversee the delivery of goods and services. Given the incentive to focus on sustaining the franchise funds’ operations and the many service providers from which customers like DOD may choose, objective oversight would help to ensure that franchise funds adhere to procurement regulations and operate as intended. The Office of Management and Budget, which designated and has previously evaluated the franchise funds, is well positioned to periodically evaluate, monitor, and develop guidance to improve the franchise funds’ contracting activities. While a number of actions to improve DOD’s use of other agencies’ contracting services are already underway, to enhance these initiatives, we make the following eight recommendations to DOD, the Interior, the Treasury, and the Office of Management and Budget. To ensure that DOD customers analyze alternatives when choosing franchise funds and to provide DOD with the measurable data it needs to assess the value of the franchise funds’ contracting services, we recommend that the Secretary of Defense take the following three actions: Develop a methodology to help DOD customers determine whether use of franchise funds’ contracting services is in the best interest of the government. The methodology should include analysis of tradeoffs. Reinforce DOD customers’ ability to define their needs and desired contract outcomes clearly. This skill includes working with franchise fund contracting officers to translate their needs into contract requirements and to develop oversight plans that ensure adequate contract monitoring. monitor and evaluate DOD customers’ use of franchise funds’ contracting services, prices paid, and types of goods and services purchased. Prices include franchise fund fees and fees for use of other interagency contracts. To ensure that GovWorks and FedSource adhere to sound contracting practices, we recommend that the Secretaries of the Interior and the Treasury take the following two actions: develop procedures and performance measures for franchise fund contracting operations to demonstrate compliance with federal procurement regulations and policies while maintaining focus on customer service and develop procedures for franchise fund contracting officers to work closely with DOD customers to define contract outcomes and effective oversight methods. To ensure that the FedSource workforce has the skills to carry out contracting responsibilities, we recommend that the Secretary of the Treasury take the following action: assign warranted contracting officers to positions responsible for performing contracting officer functions. In order to provide incentives for the franchise funds to adhere to procurement regulations and to ensure that franchise funds operate as intended, we recommend that the Director of the Office of Management and Budget take the following two actions: Expand monitoring to include franchise funds contracting operations’ compliance with procurement regulations and policies. These findings should be available to customers to ensure transparency and accountability to customers and the Congress. Develop guidance to clarify the roles and responsibilities of the parties involved in interagency contracting through franchise funds. We provided a draft of this report to DOD, the departments of the Interior and the Treasury, and the Office of Management and Budget for review and comment. We received written comments from DOD and the Department of the Treasury, which are reprinted in appendices IV and V respectively. The Department of the Interior and the Office of Management and Budget provided comments via e-mail. DOD concurred with our recommendations and identified actions it has taken or plans to take to address them. In response to our recommendation that the Secretary of Defense develop a methodology to help DOD customers determine whether the use of franchise funds’ contracting services is in the best interest of the government, DOD indicated that action had been taken through the issuance of a policy memo titled Proper Use of Non-DOD Contracts and subsequent policies issued by the military departments. We acknowledge the DOD policy memo in our report and note that this guidance describes general factors to consider but does not provide specific criteria for how to make this determination. The policies issued by the military departments establish procedures for review and approval of the use of non-DOD contract vehicles, but do not address methods of determining whether this is in the best interest of the government. Our recommendation takes these actions into account and encourages DOD to go further by developing a methodology to help customers assess contracting alternatives. In response to our recommendation that DOD reinforce DOD customers’ ability to define their needs and desired contract outcomes clearly, DOD maintained that it is the responsibility of the franchise fund contracting officer to decide whether or not the requirement is described accurately. Nonetheless, DOD committed to issue a memo by August 31, 2005, reinforcing the need for DOD customers to define clearly their requirements and articulate clearly their desired outcomes in the acquisition process. We believe that this memo, coupled with DOD’s ongoing efforts to educate DOD customers about the use of interagency acquisitions, are steps in the right direction. Finally, in response to our recommendation that DOD monitor and evaluate DOD customers’ use of franchise funds’ contracting services, DOD concurred but explained that the data capture systems that would provide this information are not yet in place. DOD stated that the Federal Procurement Data System-Next Generation would provide this capability in fiscal year 2006. However, data collection is just one step in the evaluation process. In addition to collecting data, DOD will also need to compare alternatives and prices in order to make more informed choices. Further, the accuracy and reliability of interagency contracting data in the Federal Procurement Data System-Next Generation will depend heavily on accurate reporting by franchise funds. The Department of the Interior concurred with our recommendations and identified actions it has taken or plans to take to address them. The Interior highlighted 2004 accomplishments and acknowledged a need for better documentation to demonstrate compliance and value provided. The Interior also committed to ensuring an adequate contracting staff and to publishing information to help DOD determine the value of using the franchise fund. In response to our recommendation that the Department of the Interior develop procedures and performance measures for franchise fund contracting operations to demonstrate compliance with federal procurement regulations, the Interior highlighted a number of recent efforts to improve performance, including its 2004 management control review and performance improvement plan that will monitor compliance with federal procurement regulations. This plan establishes a goal of 75 percent reduction in reportable findings. Interior also stated that it had revised its acquisition review process, awarded a contract for a third party acquisition review, and provided additional training to its staff. Interior committed to continue monitoring performance and creating guidance as needed. In response to our recommendation that the Interior develop procedures for franchise fund contracting officers to work more closely with DOD customers, the Interior highlighted efforts to train its contracting officers and develop policies for working with DOD customers. The Department of the Treasury concurred with our recommendations and identified actions it has taken or plans to take to address them, including centralization of FedSource’s acquisition workforce under one line of authority to allow for standardization and consistency. In response to our recommendation that FedSource develop procedures and performance measures for franchise fund contracting operations to demonstrate compliance with federal procurement regulations, the Treasury committed to continue to conduct reviews to measure and evaluate compliance with federal procurement regulations and policies. This is a positive step toward ensuring compliance. The Treasury also said that FedSource had instituted performance-based statements of work for its acquisitions. While this initiative focuses on some aspects of compliance and is important in managing contractor performance, our recommendation addresses the performance of the franchise fund. Developing performance measures related to compliance with procurement regulations would reinforce the agency’s commitment to compliance and provide a means to monitor and demonstrate progress. In response to our recommendation that FedSource develop procedures for franchise fund contracting officers to work more closely with DOD customers, the Treasury indicated that FedSource will also develop procedures to provide its customers with clear guidance for defining contract outcomes. In response to our recommendation that FedSource assign warranted contracting officers to positions responsible for performing contracting officer functions, Treasury stated that FedSource has hired contracting officers to perform all contracting officer functions. OMB concurred with our recommendations that OMB expand its monitoring to include franchise funds contracting operations’ compliance with procurement regulations and policies and develop guidance to clarify the roles and responsibilities of the parties involved in interagency contracting through franchise funds. OMB stated that its Office of Federal Procurement Policy (OFPP) proposed to include the implementation of our recommendations in an undertaking pertaining to governmentwide acquisition contracts and incorporate franchise funds into that project. As part of that project, OMB/OFPP is asking the designated agencies to develop plans to ensure cost-effective and responsible contracting. The plans will address (1) training to contracting staff; (2) customer staff training; (3) management controls to ensure contracts are awarded in accordance with applicable laws, regulations, and policies; (4) contract administration; and (5) periodic management reviews. OMB acknowledged that this was only a part of the solution. We encourage OMB to give additional consideration to providing guidance that would clarify roles and responsibilities of the parties involved in interagency contracting through franchise funds. We are sending copies of this report to the Secretaries of Defense, the Interior, and the Treasury; the Director of the Office of Management and Budget; and interested congressional committees. We will provide copies to others on request. This report will also be available at no charge on GAO’s Web site at http://www.gao.gov. If you have any questions about this report or need additional information, please call me at (202) 512-4841 (cooperd@gao.gov).

Other staff making key contributions to this report were Amelia Shachoy, Assistant Director; Lily Chin; Lara Laufer; Janet McKelvey; Kenneth Patton; Monty Peters; and Ralph Roffo. In memory of Monty Peters (1948-2005), under whose skilled leadership this review was conducted. We reviewed legislation establishing the franchise fund pilot program, governmentwide guidance relating to the program, and reports summarizing program outcomes. We held discussions with Office of Management and Budget representatives responsible for overseeing and providing guidance for the program and with Department of Defense (DOD) officials responsible for oversight of procurement issues. We performed work at the franchise funds managed by the departments of the Interior and the Treasury and interviewed officials and reviewed records relating to Interior’s GovWorks and Treasury’s FedSource programs. The Interior and Treasury franchise funds accounted for about 76 percent of total revenues for the six franchise funds during fiscal year 2003 (the most recently completed fiscal year at the time we were planning our field work) and about 95 percent of all services the six funds provided DOD. Contracting services the GovWorks and FedSource programs provided accounted for over 95 percent of total revenues at the Interior and Treasury franchise funds. To gain insight into how DOD customers were using franchise funds and into franchise fund contracting processes, we reviewed documentation relating to 17 selected customer projects totaling $249 million in funding provided and interviewed GovWorks and FedSource contracting personnel responsible for these projects and representatives of the DOD customers. To determine how DOD customers determined whether franchise funds provided a good value, we interviewed representatives of DOD customers for the selected projects and reviewed available documentation relating to decisions to use franchise fund contracts. We also reviewed information available from the franchise funds that would indicate whether the franchise funds provided a good value, and interviewed franchise fund officials. To determine how franchise fund contracting officers worked with DOD customers to define measurable quality standards for goods and services and develop effective oversight mechanisms, we reviewed contract documentation for selected customer projects that would establish quality standards, and documentation relating to contract oversight. We also discussed these issues with franchise fund contracting personnel. In addition, we discussed these issues with representatives of DOD customers and reviewed available documentation. To determine whether franchise funds followed the contracting practices needed to ensure fair and reasonable prices, we reviewed contract documentation for selected customer projects to assess the extent to which contracting personnel sought competition for work and analyzed proposed prices to determine whether they were fair and reasonable, and discussed these issues with contracting personnel. In addition, we discussed these issues with representatives of DOD customers and reviewed available documentation. To select customer projects for review, we obtained data files from the Department of the Interior’s GovWorks and the Department of the Treasury’s FedSource contracting programs that reflected customer projects active during fiscal year 2003, and the dollar value of customer funding provided for these projects during the year. We ranked these projects in terms of funding provided and selected projects representing the greatest dollar value of customer funding provided—10 GovWorks projects accounting for $164 million and 7 FedSource projects accounting for $85 million. Table 5 summarizes GovWorks projects, and table 6 summarizes FedSource projects. GovWorks contracting personnel fulfilled the requirements of each project selected by award of a single order, and we reviewed contract documentation related to the relevant order. FedSource contracting personnel, in contrast, fulfilled the requirements of customer projects by award of one or more contracts or orders. Further, FedSource personnel initiated multiple work assignments—in some cases several hundred—to define specific work what would be performed under each of the contracts awarded or orders placed. Accordingly, we reviewed all contracts awarded or orders placed to fulfill the requirements of the selected customer projects and a sample of work assignments initiated under these contracts or orders. To select sample work assignments for review, we first ranked the work assignments in terms of dollar value of the work to be performed. For those projects where a relatively small number of work assignments accounted for a significant share of total project value, we selected the highest dollar value assignments representing at least 50 percent of total project value. For those projects where most individual work assignments represented only a small fraction of total project value, we selected all assignments valued at $150,000 or more and a sample— selected at random—of the remaining work assignments. We conducted our review between June 2004 and June 2005 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. Appendix II: Franchise Fund Operating Principles The enterprise should only provide common administrative support services. The organization would have a clearly defined organizational structure including readily identifiable delineation of responsibilities and functions and separately identifiable units for the purpose of accumulating and reporting revenues and costs. The funds of the organization must be separate and identifiable and not commingled with another organization. The provision of services should be on a fully competitive basis. The organization’s operation should not be “sheltered” or be a monopoly. The operation should be self-sustaining. Fees will be established to recover the “full costs,” as defined by standards issued in accordance with the Federal Accounting Standards Advisory Board. The organization must have a comprehensive set of performance measures to assess each service that is being offered. Cost and performance benchmarks against other “competitors” are maintained and evaluated. The ability to adjust capacity and resources up or down as business rises or falls, or as other conditions dictate, if necessary. Resources to provide for “surge” capacity and peak business periods, capital investments, and new starts should be available. The organization should specify that prior to curtailing or eliminating a service, the provider will give notice within a reasonable and mutually agreed time frame so the customer may obtain services elsewhere. Notice will also be given within a reasonable and mutually agreeable time frame to the provider when the customer elects to obtain services elsewhere. Customers should be able to “exit” and go elsewhere for services after appropriate notification to the service provider and be permitted to choose other providers to obtain needed service. Full-time equivalents would be accounted for in a manner consistent with the Federal Workforce Restructuring Act and Office of Management and Budget requirements, such as Circular A-11. Capitalization of franchises, administrative service, or other cross-servicing operations should include the appropriate full-time equivalents commensurate with the level of effort the operation has committed to perform.","The Department of Defense (DOD) is the largest user of other federal agencies' contracting services. The availability of these contracting services has enabled DOD and other departments to save time by paying other agencies to award and administer contracts for goods and services on their behalf. DOD can access these contracting services a number of ways, such as ordering directly from interagency contracts for commonly needed items. DOD also can pay someone else to do the work. For example, DOD uses franchise funds, which are government-run, fee-for-service organizations that provide a portfolio of services, including contracting services. As part of a congressional mandate, GAO assessed whether franchise funds ensured fair and reasonable prices for goods and services, whether DOD analyzed purchasing alternatives, and whether DOD and franchise funds ensured value by defining contract outcomes and overseeing contractor performance. GovWorks and FedSource, two of the franchise funds that DOD has relied on for contracting services, have not always ensured fair and reasonable prices while purchasing goods and services. The franchise funds also may have missed opportunities to achieve savings from millions of dollars in purchases, including engineering, telecommunications, or construction services. In the course of its review, GAO examined $249 million worth of orders and work assignments from the contracts the franchise funds used to make purchases on DOD's behalf. In many cases, GovWorks sought but did not receive competing proposals. GovWorks added substantial work--as much as 20 times above the original value of a particular order--without determining that prices were fair and reasonable. FedSource generally did not ensure competition for work, did not conduct price analyses, and sometimes paid contractors higher prices for services than established in contracts with no justification provided in the contract files. For its part, DOD--in the absence of clear guidance on the proper use of other agencies' contracting services--chose to use franchise funds on the basis of convenience without analyzing whether using franchise funds' contracting services was the best method for meeting purchasing needs. DOD also lacks information about purchases made through other agencies contracts, including franchise funds, which makes it difficult to make informed decisions about the use of these types of contracts. The franchise funds' business-operating principles require that they maintain and evaluate cost and performance benchmarks against their competitors. However, the franchise funds did not perform analyses that DOD could have used to assess whether the funds deliver good value. The funds' performance measures generally focus on customer satisfaction and generating revenues. These measures create an incentive to increase sales volume and meet customer demands at the expense of ensuring proper use of contracts and good value. DOD and the franchise funds--which share responsibility for ensuring value through sound contracting practices such as defining contract outcomes and overseeing contractor performance--did not adequately define requirements. Without well-defined requirements, DOD and the franchise funds lacked criteria to measure contractor performance effectively. On a separate oversight-related issue, GAO found that the departments of the Interior and the Treasury--each of which has responsibility in the successful operation of the respective franchise funds--and the Office of Management of Budget have performed little oversight of GovWorks and FedSource.",govreport
"Wildland fires play an important ecological role on the nation’s landscapes. Fires have long shaped the composition of forests and grasslands across every region of the United States, including ponderosa pine forests in the Northwest and the Rocky Mountain West, chaparral in the Southwest, sagebrush steppe in the Great Basin, tallgrass prairies in the Midwest, longleaf pine forests in the South, and the pine barrens of the Atlantic Coast. Fires periodically reduce vegetation densities and stimulate seedling regeneration and growth in some species. Wildland fires can be ignited by lightning or by humans, either accidentally or intentionally. As we have described in previous reports from our body of work on wildland fire management, however, various land use and management practices over the past century—including fire suppression, grazing, and timber harvesting—have reduced the normal frequency of fires in many forest and rangeland ecosystems and have reduced these ecosystems’ resiliency to fire. We have reported that these practices contributed to abnormally dense, continuous accumulations of vegetation, which not only can fuel uncharacteristically large or severe wildland fires but also—with more homes and communities built in or near areas at risk from wildland fire—threaten lives, health, property, and infrastructure. In addition, changing climate conditions, including drier conditions in certain parts of the country, have increased the length and severity of wildfire seasons, according to many scientists and researchers. For example, in the western United States, the average number of days in the fire season increased from approximately 200 in 1980 to approximately 300 in 2013, according to the 2014 Quadrennial Fire Review. In Texas and Oklahoma, the average fire season increased from fewer than 100 days to more than 300 during this time frame. According to the U.S. Global Change Research Program’s 2014 National Climate Assessment, projected climate changes suggest that western forests in the United States will be increasingly affected by large and intense fires that occur more frequently. Figure 1 shows the Forest Service’s assessment of wildfire hazard potential across the country as of 2014. Working collaboratively across federal-nonfederal boundaries to address the wildland fire issue can involve any mix of the nation’s 2.3 billion acres of federal, state, local, private, or tribal lands. Historical settlement and development of the nation resulted in the intermingling of lands among these different entities. As we reported in 2008, about 60 percent of the nation’s land is privately owned and managed, and about 30 percent is managed by five federal land management agencies, with the Forest Service and BLM managing the majority of those lands. Of the remainder, about 8 percent of the nation’s land is owned and managed by state and local governments, and about 2 percent is owned and managed by the federal government for purposes such as military installations and water infrastructure. Under the National Forest Management Act and the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976, respectively, the Forest Service and BLM manage lands for various uses such as protection of fish and wildlife habitat, forage for livestock, recreation, timber harvesting, and mineral production. FWS and NPS manage federal lands under legislation that primarily calls for conservation; activities such as harvesting timber for commercial use are generally precluded. As noted, BIA is responsible for the administration and management of lands held in trust by the United States for Indian tribes, individuals, and Alaska Natives. Each of the five agencies has regional or state offices that oversee individual field units. State forestry agencies and other nonfederal entities—including tribal, county, city, and rural fire departments—have primary responsibility for managing wildland fires on nonfederal lands, and share responsibility for protecting homes and other private structures. State and local governments can also adopt laws requiring homeowners and homebuilders to take measures to help protect structures from wildland fires. Regulating land use on nonfederal and nontribal lands is primarily a state and local responsibility. The challenge of balancing the benefits of periodic fires with fire’s negative effects on communities is particularly difficult in the WUI. Development in the WUI increased over the last several decades, in turn increasing the risk to life and property from wildland fire. According to the 2014 Quadrennial Fire Review, 60 percent of new homes built in the United States since 1990 were built in the WUI, which contains 46 million single-family homes, representing about 40 percent of single-family homes in the United States. Most development in the WUI occurs on nonfederal lands, and, according to the National Association of State Foresters, approximately 76,000 communities nationwide are considered to be at risk from wildland fire. According to the National Interagency Fire Center, the average number of structures burned by wildfire each year from 1999 through 2015 was 2,750; in 2015 alone, the total number of structures destroyed by wildfire was 4,636, of which 2,638 were residences. In addition to residential development, other assets that support communities can be located in the WUI, including power lines, highways, and resources that provide economic benefits to communities, such as timber, oil and gas wells, and recreational opportunities. WUI communities can be very different from each other—for example, seasonal resort towns located in valleys, with homes in close proximity and surrounded by fire-prone vegetation, or major suburban or metropolitan areas adjacent to wildlands. The risk each community faces also varies depending on such things as the flammability of the vegetation in and around the community, structure location and building materials, and local land use decisions. While the degree of risk can vary from one place to another, under specific conditions, wildfire can affect people and their homes in almost any location where vegetation is found. Even structures not immediately adjacent to wildland vegetation can be vulnerable because wind can transport embers and ignite homes more than a mile from a fire. Figure 2 provides examples of variation across communities by showing characteristics of the communities included in our review. See appendix II for the full text of this graphic. Federal agencies and nonfederal entities collaborate in a variety of ways to reduce the risk of wildland fire before a potential wildland fire incident occurs, through fuel reduction, fire preparedness, prevention, and education activities. In addition, individuals and communities may take action to mitigate fire risk by, for example, using fire-resistant building materials or building in low-risk areas. Collectively, these activities are generally intended to contribute to helping communities become more fire adapted. Fuel reduction—the removal of flammable vegetation that can fuel fires— can reduce the severity of wildland fires that occur, slow fire spread, or otherwise make fires more manageable. Fuel reduction can occur through mechanical treatment (i.e., thinning of trees and underbrush) or planned ignitions (known as prescribed fires), which often replicate the positive effects of naturally occurring wildfire. Federal agencies have collaborated with nonfederal entities to prioritize, plan, and conduct fuel reduction activities. For example, federal agencies have assisted local communities or counties in developing Community Wildfire Protection Plans— documents that outline ways individual communities plan to reduce their risk from wildland fire, such as by identifying priority areas for fuel reduction. Federal agencies have also funded landscape-scale fuel reduction projects that span multiple jurisdictions and include multiple partners. Federal initiatives involving such projects include the Collaborative Forest Landscape Restoration Program and the Reserved Treaty Rights Lands Program. Preparedness activities can help communities protect themselves during a wildland fire by ensuring they have access to fire suppression equipment, personnel, and emergency dispatch services. To prepare for wildfire seasons, federal agencies, states, and others sign agreements— such as State Cooperative Wildland Fire Management and Stafford Act Response Agreements—to document their commitment to coordinate and exchange personnel, equipment, supplies, services, and funds among the agencies for responding to wildland fires. At the local level, federal land management officials may meet with nonfederal entities, such as local fire department officials, ahead of the wildland fire season to discuss roles and responsibilities for wildland fire response and to train together by simulating incident responses. Prevention activities can reduce the likelihood of fires caused by humans. From 2001 through 2011, approximately 85 percent of wildfires in the United States were human-caused, according to the National Interagency Fire Center. Such fires can occur unintentionally—for example, when people burn leaves or trash or leave campfires unattended—or they may be deliberately set. According to research, communities with effective wildfire prevention programs are likely to have fewer human-caused fire starts. To help provide information about fire prevention, federal agencies work with nonfederal entities. For example, under the Cooperative Forest Fire Prevention program, established under the Smokey Bear Act of 1952, the Forest Service works with the National Association of State Foresters and the Ad Council to develop and distribute materials for the Smokey Bear campaign. Education activities can help reduce risk by helping homeowners and communities understand actions they can take to reduce risk. For example, communities may help minimize their risk by reducing vegetation and flammable objects around structures—an activity often called creating defensible space. They also may help minimize their risk by using fire-resistant building materials in construction and building in low-risk areas. To help provide information about these activities, federal agencies worked with stakeholder groups to develop a guide “designed to help leaders, planners, emergency professionals, and citizens learn the best approaches and programs to help their community become more fire adapted.” Some communities have encouraged the use of voluntary programs aimed at improving fire risk awareness and promoting steps to reduce their risk, such as the Firewise Communities program. In addition, some states have adopted legislation to encourage or require wildfire mitigation in high-risk areas. For example, some state and local governments have adopted laws and ordinances requiring property owners to establish and maintain defensible space. Figure 3 shows various actions federal agencies and nonfederal entities may take to reduce wildfire risk in and around communities. Some federal-nonfederal collaboration at the national level encompasses all types of risk-reduction efforts. For example, federal agencies and nonfederal entities participate in the Wildland Fire Leadership Council (WFLC), an intergovernmental committee of federal, tribal, state, county, and municipal government officials. The WFLC is to provide strategic oversight to help ensure policy coordination, accountability, and effective implementation of long-term strategies to address wildfire preparedness and suppression, hazardous fuel reduction, restoration and rehabilitation of the nation’s wildlands, and assistance to communities. After emphasizing the need to suppress all fires for much of the 20th century, federal agencies in recent decades reassessed their approach to wildland fire management. As part of this reassessment, and as a result of several wildfires and associated firefighter fatalities, the agencies developed the Federal Wildland Fire Management Policy of 1995. Under this policy, the agencies sought to make communities and resources less susceptible to damage from wildland fires and to respond to fires to protect communities and important resources at risk while considering the cost and long-term effects of that response. The policy was reaffirmed and updated in 2001, and guidance for its implementation was issued in 2003 and 2009. To address the increase in wildland fires threatening communities, over the past 2 decades, federal land management agencies have also placed greater emphasis on coordinating efforts with nonfederal entities to reduce the risk of fire. For example, in 2000, the President asked the Secretaries of Agriculture and the Interior to submit a report on managing the impact of wildland fires on communities and the environment. The report, along with congressional approval of increased appropriations for wildland fire management for fiscal year 2001, as well as other related activities, formed the basis of what is known as the National Fire Plan. As part of this effort, Congress directed the Secretaries of Agriculture and the Interior to work with state governors to develop a strategy. The resulting strategy—the 10-Year Comprehensive Strategy—was developed by federal, state, tribal, and local government and nongovernmental representatives and outlined a collaborative framework to facilitate implementation of proactive and protective measures to reduce the risk of wildland fire to communities and the environment. For example, the strategy recognized that while suppressing fires—especially near homes and communities—is important, a continued shift in fire management emphasis from reactive to proactive is also important in order to address the root of the problem rather than react only when faced with costly emergencies. Specifically, the strategy emphasized, among other things, the importance of reducing human-caused fires through fire-prevention education, increasing incentives for private landowners to address defensible space and fuel reduction on private property through local land use policies, promoting local government initiatives to implement fire- sensitive land use planning, and prioritizing fuel reduction where the negative impacts of wildland fire are greatest. As noted, in 2014, the federal agencies, in collaboration with partners from multiple jurisdictions, issued the Cohesive Strategy. The vision of the Cohesive Strategy is “to safely and effectively extinguish fire, when needed; use fire where allowable; manage our natural resources; and as a nation, live with wildland fire.” The Cohesive Strategy identified three goals: (1) landscapes across all jurisdictions are resilient to fire-related disturbances in accordance with management objectives, (2) human populations and infrastructure can withstand wildfire without loss of life or property, and (3) all jurisdictions participate in developing and implementing safe, effective, and efficient risk-based wildfire management decisions. The Cohesive Strategy calls for a set of national outcome measures to assess progress in meeting these goals. Since 2003, Congress has passed several laws aimed at actions federal agencies can take to reduce wildland fire risk across federal and nonfederal jurisdictions. For example, the Good Neighbor Authority contained in the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2014, authorizes the Forest Service and BLM to enter into agreements allowing states to perform watershed restoration activities, including hazardous fuel reduction projects, on federal lands when the state is performing similar activities on adjacent state or private lands. In addition, the Tribal Forest Protection Act of 2004 authorizes the Secretaries of Agriculture and the Interior to enter into agreements or contracts with Indian tribes to carry out projects to protect Indian forest lands. See appendix III for additional details about these and other relevant laws. Federal officials and stakeholders we interviewed identified federal authorities, agency initiatives, joint community-level planning, leadership, community engagement, and agency resources for collaboration as directly affecting federal-nonfederal collaboration aimed at reducing wildland fire risk to communities. In some cases these factors enhanced collaboration, according to officials, while in other cases they hindered collaboration. Federal officials and stakeholders also identified factors that indirectly affect federal and nonfederal collaboration to reduce wildland fire risk in the WUI. These included community education, fire prevention messaging, and state and local requirements for private property owners to reduce risk. Many federal officials and stakeholders said that certain federal legal authorities that allow federal agencies to work across jurisdictions with nonfederal entities facilitate federal-nonfederal collaboration to reduce wildland fire risk. Among the specific authorities they mentioned were the Good Neighbor Authority and the Tribal Forest Protection Act of 2004. For example, under the Good Neighbor Authority, the Forest Service and BLM may enter into cooperative agreements or contracts with states to allow the parties to conduct restoration and forest management activities across jurisdictional boundaries. Using this authority, the Forest Service’s Eldorado National Forest and the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection signed an agreement in 2016 allowing the agencies to work together on large-scale fuel reduction projects that both entities identified as critical to meeting fire protection objectives. The agreement is to allow the agencies to complete treatment on 500 acres located in the WUI along a major highway corridor between Sacramento and Lake Tahoe where five major wildfires have burned in the last 40 years. According to Forest Service officials, as of October 2016, the agency had executed 54 agreements using the Good Neighbor Authority in 20 states. The Tribal Forest Protection Act of 2004 authorizes the Secretaries of Agriculture and the Interior to enter into agreements or contracts with Indian tribes that meet certain criteria in order to carry out projects to protect Indian forest lands. Using this authority, the White Mountain Apache Tribe and the Forest Service’s Apache-Sitgreaves National Forest in Arizona completed the Los Burros Project on the national forest, which borders the Fort Apache Indian Reservation. According to BIA’s Fort Apache Agency officials, the project was important for reducing the risk of fire spreading onto the reservation from adjacent national forest land. According to Forest Service officials, as of November 2016, six projects had been completed using this authority, and at least six more were ongoing. Some federal officials and stakeholders said that federal and nonfederal entities are reluctant to use the Good Neighbor Authority and the Tribal Forest Protection Act of 2004 because the authorities are unclear or because not all agency staff are aware of how to use them. Forest Service headquarters officials said that since 2015, they have taken steps to provide greater clarity about using the authorities. For example, they said that Forest Service staff hosted webinars in 2015 about resources available to facilitate the use of the Good Neighbor Authority and that the agency’s website provides links to agreement templates, agency contacts, and training materials for federal and nonfederal employees working to develop agreements under this authority. Regarding the use of the Tribal Forest Protection Act of 2004, Forest Service officials said they partnered with the Intertribal Timber Council to improve working relationships with tribes and accomplish more cross-boundary landscape level restoration. According to Forest Service officials, they conducted workshops on the use of this authority in three forest service regions in 2015 and 2016, which they said contributed to six new projects pursued using the authority. Federal officials and stakeholders identified other federal and state environmental laws, including the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) and the Clean Air Act, as affecting their efforts to collaborate to reduce risk. For example, some federal officials and stakeholders said that the time it takes federal agencies to complete the NEPA process can hamper joint efforts. As we have previously reported, NEPA environmental reviews have been identified by critics as a cause of delay for projects due to time-consuming environmental analysis requirements, while they have been praised by proponents for, among other things, bringing public participation into government decision making. We also found that little data exist on the costs and benefits of NEPA analysis. With respect to the Clean Air Act, see appendix IV for additional information about the act and its effect on risk-reducing activities. Several federal officials and stakeholders identified landscape-scale restoration efforts and other programs that cross jurisdictional boundaries as helpful in bolstering collaboration to reduce wildland fire risk to communities. Among the efforts mentioned were the Department of Agriculture’s Joint Chiefs’ Landscape Restoration Partnership and BIA’s Reserved Treaty Rights Lands Program. In addition, many federal officials and stakeholders identified the Cohesive Strategy as enhancing federal-nonfederal collaboration to reduce wildland fire risk to communities. The Forest Service and the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) within the Department of Agriculture initiated the Joint Chiefs’ Landscape Restoration Partnership program in 2014 to improve the health and resilience of forest ecosystems where public and private lands meet. The program’s objectives include reducing wildfire threats to communities and landowners. In 2017, the Department of Agriculture is to invest in 10 new projects under the program while providing funding to 26 existing projects. The projects are located in 29 states across the country. For example, in 2016, the Forest Service and NRCS selected the Greater La Pine Basin project in Central Oregon as a recipient of funding under the program. The project is to take place over 3 years and is to target restoration on nearly 345,000 acres of federal, state, and private land. NRCS is to offer assistance to private landowners conducting fuel reduction treatments, while the Forest Service is to perform similar treatments on the project area located within the Deschutes National Forest. Figure 4 shows an example of tree thinning in the Greater La Pine Basin in Oregon. In 2015, BIA initiated the Reserved Treaty Rights Lands Program to treat and restore tribal landscapes within and adjacent to reserved treaty rights lands. Through this program, tribes may participate in and leverage funding for collaborative projects with nontribal landowners to enhance the health of priority tribal natural resources at high risk from wildland fire and move tribal landscapes toward long-term resilience to wildland fire. In fiscal year 2016, Interior directed $10 million toward the program, which funded 21 projects. In addition, many officials and stakeholders said that the Cohesive Strategy, issued in 2014, enhances collaboration because it emphasizes the importance of coordination across multiple agencies through an “all lands approach” and frames comprehensive goals that, taken together, may mitigate wildland fire risk. As noted, the Cohesive Strategy identified three goals: (1) landscapes across all jurisdictions are resilient to fire- related disturbances in accordance with management objectives, (2) human populations and infrastructure can withstand wildfire without loss of life or property, and (3) all jurisdictions participate in developing and implementing safe, effective, and efficient risk-based wildfire management decisions. Unlike the other initiatives described above, implementation of the Cohesive Strategy is not separately funded because the agencies do not consider it a program. One stakeholder involved in its implementation described the Cohesive Strategy as a framework designed to be applied differently in various locations and scales to best suit a particular circumstance or address a need or opportunity, rather than a one-size-fits-all approach. Even with these officials and stakeholders citing the Cohesive Strategy as enhancing collaboration, however, many officials and stakeholders also stated that improvements could be made to its implementation, as we discuss later in this report. Many federal officials and stakeholders said that joint planning, including prioritizing and developing community plans and regularly sharing information regarding wildland fire issues in person, has enhanced collaboration to reduce wildland fire risk to communities. For example, several federal officials and stakeholders said that developing annual operating plans—which outline roles, responsibilities, and resources involved in wildland fire management—between federal and nonfederal entities has been helpful for collaborating on fire preparedness activities. In addition, many federal officials and stakeholders said developing Community Wildfire Protection Plans (CWPP)—which outline ways communities aim to reduce their risk from wildland fire by, for example, prioritizing areas for fuel reduction in or near the community—enhances collaboration. Communities are not required to develop CWPPs, but when they do, the Healthy Forests Restoration Act of 2003 directs that CWPPs be developed collaboratively by local and state government representatives, in consultation with federal agencies and other interested parties. Under the act, agencies can prioritize funding for fuel reduction projects that implement CWPPs. Communities may benefit from CWPPs in several ways. For example, according to a 2015 Forest Stewards Guild report, CWPPs provide a structure for collaboration and building community capacity. The report also suggested that fuel reduction treatments completed in New Mexico communities with CWPPs have changed fire behavior, and that projects identified in CWPPs are less likely to be canceled or postponed compared to projects conducted in areas without CWPPs. Eldorado National Forest officials said that a CWPP completed in 2016 that covers an area managed by state, federal, and private landowners has helped enhance collaboration with community members to reduce risk because participants came together to jointly determine priority projects, including the placement of fuel reduction treatments. In addition, Florida state forestry officials said they used information from CWPPs to develop their statewide wildland fire risk assessment. According to these officials, the assessment helps identify communities at high risk and inform state land management decisions. Some federal officials and stakeholders also said that regularly sharing information about wildland fire issues in person can enhance collaboration to reduce wildland fire risk. For example, community members near the Eldorado National Forest said that pre-season wildland fire response training simulations, which included approximately 15 federal and nonfederal entities, helped participants develop relationships and gain a better understanding of each stakeholder’s responsibilities and concerns ahead of a potential wildland fire. These community members said that after participating in one such simulation, the state highway patrol agency began to understand the community’s concerns about impediments to safe evacuation. In addition, meeting regularly to discuss wildland fire risk reduction also helps create and facilitate collaboration, according to some officials from federal and nonfederal entities. For example, a Deschutes County official in Oregon said he participates in monthly meetings with BLM officials and community members to exchange information about upcoming activities, including efforts to reduce risk from wildland fire. He also said such meetings help develop and maintain trust between federal and nonfederal entities. Similarly, a study titled Fighting Fires with Education reported that in-person communication can increase community mitigation efforts. Many federal officials and stakeholders said that dedicated federal agency and community leadership enhances collaboration to reduce wildland fire risk to communities. Federal officials and stakeholders characterized leadership as seeking input from others, providing encouragement and support, committing, and collaborating. For example, according to Eldorado National Forest officials, leaders who actively seek input from multiple perspectives, including those with whom they may not agree, help strengthen relationships. Merritt Island National Wildlife Refuge officials said agency management’s encouragement to engage in partnerships helps employees initiate collaboration with nonfederal entities. Some Forest Service officials said that committed leaders who stay in their positions over a long period can help sustain relationships, which in turn help partners accomplish their goals of reducing wildland fire risk. For example, an Apache-Sitgreaves National Forest official said the length of time he has been at the forest—about 30 years—has helped him develop strong relationships with community members. In addition, federal officials and community members said that engaged leaders enhance federal- nonfederal collaboration. For example, Eldorado National Forest officials said that the forest supervisor, who respects community members with differing views, has helped the forest successfully complete NEPA requirements for fuel reduction projects. A National Association of Counties representative said that having federal officials who are willing to engage with communities by providing frequent updates about agency risk reduction efforts shows people that federal officials consider themselves part of the community; in doing so, they can help reduce communities’ risk of wildland fire. Similarly, a Forest Service official said that in cases in which federal, state, and local representatives work together, mitigation actions are more likely to occur and be sustained. Community members in Southern California cited an example of leadership they said enhanced collaboration. These community members said officials from NPS’ Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area initiated a meeting with local agencies in early 2016 to address public concern regarding standing dead oak trees in the area. Some of these characteristics align with a set of leading practices we previously identified as enhancing collaboration. For example, we previously found that, while collaborative mechanisms differ in complexity and scope, they all benefit from certain key features, including leadership. Many federal officials and stakeholders said an engaged community— that is, a community that understands the issues associated with wildland fire and is willing to take action to reduce risk—enhances federal- nonfederal collaboration to reduce wildland fire risk. According to federal officials and stakeholders, communities tend to be more engaged in wildland fire risk reduction activities if they have experienced recent fires, have resources to carry out risk reduction projects, and have a group of stakeholders from multiple jurisdictions dedicated to working collaboratively on wildland fire risk reduction. According to a 2013 Forest Service report, efforts to create and maintain fire-adapted communities must involve the entire community—including residents, government agencies, emergency responders, businesses, land managers, and others—if these efforts are to succeed. Officials and stakeholders provided examples of actions on the part of engaged communities, including working to identify priority locations and actions for reducing risk, creating defensible space on properties, and establishing WUI codes and ordinances aimed at reducing risk. Several federal officials and community members said that communities that have recently experienced nearby wildfires are often more eager to take action and work with federal agencies to reduce risk. For example, community members in Calabasas, California, and Topanga, California, said they created a multiagency fire council after the Old Topanga Fire in 1993, which burned about 18,000 acres, destroyed 359 homes, and resulted in three deaths. The community members said that working together through the council has helped them provide wildland fire education to community members and implement fuel reduction projects. FWS officials said that agencies and others should harness this interest in reducing risk because once a fire ends and time has passed, some community members may no longer feel the same urgency to reduce risk. In 2015, the Forest Service started a pilot program that officials said tries to take advantage of the “teachable moment” in communities recently affected by wildfires by deploying a “Community Mitigation Assistance Team” to these communities. Forest Service officials said the team focuses on, among other things, risk mitigation education and building local capacity to undertake mitigation actions. Some federal officials and stakeholders also said communities that have access to financial or other resources tend to be more engaged in carrying out risk-reduction projects. For example, Oregon Department of Forestry officials said state funding has helped establish collaborative groups, consisting of diverse stakeholders, that focus on forest-related issues around the state. California officials said federal grant funds aimed at community risk reduction help communities purchase equipment for fuel reduction projects, thereby keeping these communities engaged in mitigation efforts. Some officials and stakeholders also said it can be helpful when communities have a designated person assigned to work on wildland fire mitigation by facilitating coordination, communication, activities, and projects aimed at reducing risk. For example, Deschutes County in Oregon hired a forester who is dedicated to collaborating with the community to reduce risk, providing education about risk reduction, and initiating and implementing fuel reduction projects, among other duties. Similarly, the Forest Stewards Guild reported in 2015 that having dedicated WUI specialists helped accelerate fuel reduction work and expand public outreach in a county in New Mexico. In addition, community engagement increases when groups of stakeholders from multiple jurisdictions are involved, according to BIA headquarters officials we interviewed. For example, 27 states have prescribed fire councils, in which federal agencies, nonfederal entities, and others gather to discuss priority areas for fuel reduction treatments and adopting building codes to mitigate wildfire risk, among other issues. In contrast, some federal officials and stakeholders identified several potential impediments to community engagement. For example, some federal officials in certain areas said that residents are resistant to government intervention, including requirements that they take steps to reduce their risk on their own properties. On the other hand, an NPS official and stakeholders from western Colorado said some people expect firefighters to intervene and save their homes, and as a result these residents are not interested in taking steps to reduce risk. Furthermore, other stakeholders said that some residents resist fuel reduction treatments because they perceive the treatments as damaging the environment or because they want the privacy provided by the vegetation near their homes. Additionally, some federal officials and stakeholders said the public’s tolerance of smoke from prescribed burns can be limited, which results in fewer prescribed fire treatments. Many federal officials and stakeholders said that the availability of agency resources, including funds provided to states and localities as well as funding for agency activities, affects federal-nonfederal collaboration to reduce wildland fire risk to communities and federal efforts to reduce wildland fire risk more broadly. Regarding funding for states and localities, federal officials and stakeholders cited cooperative agreements and grants provided under the Forest Service’s State Fire Assistance (SFA) and Volunteer Fire Assistance (VFA) programs, and Interior’s assistance aimed at rural fire districts and communities, as helping communities in their efforts to reduce risk. For example, the Forest Service’s SFA program provides financial assistance through partnership agreements with state foresters for fire management activities, including helping communities become fire adapted. According to the Forest Service’s fiscal year 2017 budget justification, SFA is a critical part of the agency’s efforts to reduce wildland fire risk to communities, residents, property, and firefighters, because the program helps ensure that state, local, and private landowners have the capacity and tools they need to prepare for, respond to, and mitigate fire risk in the WUI and other critical areas. (See app. V for descriptions of selected federal programs that provide risk- reduction funding to states and localities.) Several federal officials and stakeholders said the uncertainty of federal funding through grants and assistance makes some nonfederal entities reluctant to undertake joint efforts to reduce risk. For example, California state officials said that landowners and other nonfederal entities may be reluctant to commit to joint efforts because federal funding may decrease, resulting in incomplete projects. In addition, several federal officials and stakeholders said that, in contrast to the cost-sharing mechanisms available for fire suppression activities, leveraging dollars for fuel reduction projects can be difficult because no standard procedures or agreements exist for sharing costs for such projects. According to a senior official from the National Association of State Foresters, state and federal agencies drafted a new “Supplemental Project Agreement” appendix for the Master Cooperative Wildland Fire Management and Stafford Act Response Agreement template that includes standard procedures and agreements for sharing costs associated with non- suppression projects, such as fuel reduction projects. As of February 2017, the updated Master Agreement template was undergoing review and awaiting final approval from the Departments of Agriculture and the Interior. Many federal officials and stakeholders expressed concern about the amount of funding available for risk-reducing activities carried out by the agencies. Some federal officials and stakeholders said the growing percentage of Forest Service funding spent to suppress fire has hampered the agencies’ ability to invest in activities on federally managed lands that may reduce risk. Similarly, several Interior officials said that Interior’s funding reductions, and shifts in wildland fire management priorities over the past 2 years to include a greater emphasis on sagebrush steppe ecosystems, have affected their ability to carry out wildland fire risk reduction activities. The officials also said that proposed changes to the department’s process for determining funding distribution to its four agencies may have similar effects. Funding constraints can have various effects, according to officials and stakeholders. For example, Forest Service officials said that limiting agency travel can reduce the agency’s ability to establish or maintain collaborative relationships with nonfederal entities. Forest Service officials also said that fire prevention efforts have been diminished in cases in which the agency has eliminated fire prevention positions or not filled them when they became vacant. A BIA official said that decreased fuel reduction funding reduced the number of acres the agency could treat on the Warm Springs Indian Reservation. Many federal officials and stakeholders identified other factors that indirectly affect federal-nonfederal collaboration to reduce wildland fire risk in the WUI. These include community education, fire prevention messaging, and state and local requirements for private property owners to take steps to reduce risk. Many federal officials and stakeholders identified community education efforts, such as the Firewise program and individual home risk assessments, as helping reduce community wildland fire risk. Some federal officials and stakeholders said Firewise, which encourages homeowners to take responsibility for their own properties by using fire resistant building materials and establishing defensible space, has helped reduce risk through community education. For example, a Florida Forest Service official said the Firewise program helped communicate to communities across the state the importance of reducing wildland fire risk. This official said the Firewise program works well in the state because it primarily relies on voluntary action rather than regulations. Figure 5 shows an example of a Firewise presentation at a community event and an advertisement for a Firewise event. Federal officials also said they have used the Ready, Set, Go! program to educate the public. For example, officials from the Apache-Sitgreaves National Forest in Arizona said they use this program to help members of the public understand actions they can take to prepare for a wildland fire incident, such as making sure car gas tanks are at least half full so that homeowners can evacuate quickly in case of a wildfire. Some federal officials said that conducting property risk assessments has been helpful to educate property owners about the steps they can take to reduce their risk of wildland fire. For example, BIA officials said fire managers at the Fort Apache Indian Reservation reach out to homeowners individually to teach them about risk-reducing actions they could take based on their home’s characteristics; these actions could include clearing vegetation or relocating firewood to a spot away from their home. BIA officials said that because they make the effort to reach people at home, rather than provide general information to the broader public, homeowners are more likely to undertake risk-reducing activities pertinent to their homes. However, some officials said homeowners are not always receptive to having their properties evaluated, and some stakeholders said not all counties can afford to conduct risk assessments and not all homeowners want to pay to create defensible space. More broadly, a Forest Service headquarters official said that, while community education has been successful in increasing awareness about reducing risk, it does not necessarily result in individuals or communities taking action. In addition, this official said programs such as Firewise have increased risk awareness, but the extent of the risk reduction is unclear. To help address this, the official said the agency expects to complete a study in late 2017 that examines mitigation actions resulting from the Firewise program; the Forest Service is conducting this study in partnership with the National Wildfire Coordinating Group, the Wildland Urban Interface Mitigation Committee, and the National Association of State Foresters. Also, this Forest Service official said the agency and the National Fire Protection Association are discussing making changes to the Firewise program to emphasize mitigation actions. Another factor that several federal officials and stakeholders identified as helping reduce wildland fire risk to communities is providing both consistent and targeted messaging to prevent human-caused wildfires. Regarding consistent prevention messaging, Forest Service officials said that numerous federal and state agencies in the western United States have used the One Less Spark–One Less Wildfire campaign, which started in California in 2012 and has since been used in other states. In addition, some federal officials we spoke with said they use the Smokey Bear campaign and materials as part of fire prevention efforts in their communities. A community in Arizona, which attracts recreation visitors but is prone to fires, created a working group to improve the consistency of local fire prevention messages. Specifically, officials from the Apache-Sitgreaves National Forest, the BIA Fort Apache Agency, surrounding counties, the Pinetop-Lakeside community, and other entities formed the White Mountain Fire Restrictions Working Group. Working group members said they issue unified, cross-jurisdictional fire restrictions (i.e., limitations on activities such as building campfires or using fireworks) to help ensure the consistency of information provided to the public. According to working group members, before they formed this group, the area was at greater risk of human-caused fire because each jurisdiction issued its own level of fire restriction, which led to public confusion because the fire restrictions often differed across jurisdictions. Working group members said that as a result of their efforts, the risk of fire has decreased because the public is less confused about where and when fire-related activities can be conducted. Regarding targeted fire prevention messaging, Forest Service officials cited National Fire Prevention Education Teams as an example of federal-nonfederal efforts to provide targeted fire prevention information. These officials said the National Wildfire Coordinating Group sends teams—which may include members from the Departments of Agriculture and the Interior, states, and others—to areas at high risk of wildland fire to raise awareness of actions communities can take to reduce their risk. According to the National Interagency Fire Center, these teams can help reduce the loss of human life, property, and resources. They can also improve interagency relations. BIA officials said that, in part because of targeted efforts aimed at reducing arson, the number of human-caused fires on the Fort Apache Indian Reservation in Arizona decreased from several hundred in 2004 to 40 in 2016. BIA officials estimated that these types of efforts also helped reduce the number of fires caused by youths on the Warm Springs Indian Reservation in Oregon from 17 in 2009 to 2 in 2016. A study conducted by the Forest Service and Interior agencies found that large-scale wildfire prevention programs on tribal lands are highly effective and such programs have reduced the number of wildfire ignitions caused by campfire escapes, arson, and youth-ignited wildfires, among others. Several federal officials and stakeholders noted that state and local laws governing home location, construction, and landscaping can reduce wildland fire risk to communities. Some states and local governments require homeowners in certain locations to use fire-resistant building materials or to create a certain amount of “defensible space” around structures on their properties by removing or reducing potentially flammable vegetation. For example, under Oregon’s Forestland-Urban Interface Fire Protection Act, property owners in identified forestland- urban interface areas must reduce excess vegetation around structures and along driveways that can fuel a fire. According to Oregon state officials, the law, at the time of our review, was applicable to 17 of Oregon’s 36 counties identified as having a higher wildland fire risk. Oregon state officials said it is helpful that the state legislature recognizes the need for individual homeowner action in risk mitigation, and they said they are reviewing the law to determine ways it could be improved. California state law also requires property owners in certain areas to maintain a specified amount of defensible space around structures. Local governments in several states have codes or ordinances aimed at wildland fire risk reduction by requiring fire resistant building materials, requiring the creation of defensible space, or limiting where homes can be built. For example, the San Diego, California, municipal code’s Landscape Regulations aim to reduce the risk of fire through site design and management of flammable vegetation. An official from the National Association of Counties said that local policies promoting resiliency and fire readiness through building codes and zoning ordinances can be helpful but also resource intensive. As a result, this official said, county decision-makers should weigh the costs of requiring such actions against the benefits gained through reduced risk. Forest Service headquarters officials said codes and ordinances can help reduce wildland fire risk in some circumstances, but they said no data are available to show what type of community planning is instrumental in reducing risk. These officials also noted that taking action does not guarantee that a home will be spared, given the conditions and severity of a fire. According to a nonfederal researcher we interviewed, it is also helpful when communities integrate actions or requirements to reduce risk into comprehensive county land-use plans. For example, the Community Planning Assistance for Wildfire program, established in 2015 by Headwaters Economics and Wildfire Planning International, is a grant program that works with communities to help reduce wildfire risk through improved land-use planning. In Wenatchee, Washington, the program developed recommendations to help the community improve its land-use plans specific to its wildland fire risk. While the community has high- frequency fires, they are not high intensity and most are grass fires, though many buildings have been lost in recent fires. Through the program, community planners determined that it was unnecessary to require the entire community to use fire-resistant building materials and create defensible space; instead, they decided to place such requirements on homes located in the community’s highest risk areas. Federal officials and stakeholders we interviewed said that improving implementation of the Cohesive Strategy, increasing collaborative planning, expanding education, increasing prevention efforts, and improving local timber-processing capabilities could improve federal agencies’ and nonfederal entities’ ability to reduce wildland fire risk to communities. Officials and stakeholders also identified actions that, while not necessarily within federal agencies’ control, could help reduce wildland fire risk to communities. These include increasing state and local adoption of laws and ordinances that encourage fire-resistant building and landscaping and that limit development in certain areas, and providing insurance incentives to encourage property owners and communities to adopt risk-reducing measures. Many federal officials and stakeholders said that improving the implementation of the Cohesive Strategy could help reduce wildland fire risk to communities. For example, some stakeholders said that federal agencies could improve communication about the Cohesive Strategy, which could further its implementation. One such stakeholder said that he believes some federal land management officials still have not heard of the Cohesive Strategy (issued in 2014), and that roles and responsibilities for implementing the strategy are not well defined at the national level. Some officials and stakeholders said it is important to increase accountability for implementing the Cohesive Strategy, such as through the use of performance measures as part of implementing the strategy. The Cohesive Strategy states that its successful implementation depends in part on monitoring and accountability, noting that “A set of national outcome performance measures will allow Congress, the national wildland fire management community, and other stakeholders to monitor and assess progress toward achieving the results for each of the three national goals.” This emphasis on monitoring and accountability is consistent with key characteristics we have described for developing and implementing effective national strategies. Likewise, one of the key collaboration practices we have identified is that federal agencies engaged in collaborative efforts should develop mechanisms to monitor, evaluate, and report on results. We found that reporting on these activities can help key decision makers within the agencies, as well as clients and stakeholders, obtain feedback for improving both policy and operational effectiveness. The agencies use “success stories” to share what they consider successful or effective efforts at implementing the Cohesive Strategy. However, the success stories we reviewed focus on individual projects or efforts and do not generally indicate the role, if any, that the Cohesive Strategy played or describe the extent to which the projects or efforts have individually or cumulatively contributed to achieving the strategy’s goals. More broadly, the Wildland Fire Leadership Council (WFLC)—the interagency organization responsible for oversight and leadership in implementing the Cohesive Strategy (and which includes the Forest Service and Interior as members)—has not developed measures to assess progress on the part of federal and nonfederal participants in meeting the national goals of the Cohesive Strategy. According to a December 2016 WFLC report, a performance measure task group was convened in January 2013 and proposed several performance measures that could be used to track progress in achieving the broad goals of the Cohesive Strategy. One such measure was the percentage of communities at risk with a high probability of withstanding wildfire without loss of life and infrastructure; this measure was intended to assess the extent to which the threat to communities at risk from wildfire had decreased. However, the Wildland Fire Executive Council, a former advisory council to WFLC, concluded that, while performance information for many of the 2013 task group’s proposed measures could be collected using reporting measures the agencies already had in place, fully implementing the proposed performance measures would likely place undue burden on the agencies and nonfederal partners. The Forest Service and Interior each have performance measures to monitor and assess their wildland fire management efforts. For example, one of Interior’s performance measures is the amount of fuel reduction conducted in the WUI, which is consistent with the Cohesive Strategy’s emphasis on resilient landscapes. However, these agency measures are intended to separately assess each agency’s performance—or, in some cases the performance of specific programs—and do not represent the set of measures to assess national progress toward meeting the Cohesive Strategy’s goals, as called for in the strategy. The 2016 WFLC report states that the use of research findings, remote sensing, and modelling can help quantify the effects of activities over time and can contribute to showing accountability and success in meeting the goals of the Cohesive Strategy. Because the report was issued in December 2016, Forest Service and Interior officials said they have not had sufficient time to determine which, if any, research findings can be useful in this effort. By working with their WFLC partners to develop measures, the Forest Service and Interior could better assess national progress toward achieving the goals of the Cohesive Strategy. Many federal officials and stakeholders said increasing collaborative planning could help reduce fire risk to communities. Several federal officials and stakeholders said such planning could occur by developing or improving CWPPs, and some said increasing the frequency of collaborative in-person meetings ahead of fire seasons could help reduce risk. These suggested actions align with a 2013 Forest Service study that found that, while individual homeowner actions are essential to reduce the potential for wildfire damage to property, it is also critical for entire communities to work together on a broader planning and development scale. Regarding CWPPs, some officials and stakeholders said that more communities developing CWPPs and taking steps to improve their usefulness could enhance collaborative efforts to reduce wildland fire risk to communities. The National Association of State Foresters estimates that, as of fiscal year 2015, about 20 percent of the approximately 76,000 communities identified as being at risk from fire were covered by a CWPP. Because it is helpful to collaboratively plan, a stakeholder with the Northeast Regional Cohesive Strategy Committee said the committee is encouraging more communities to develop CWPPs or equivalent plans and to make collaborative planning a priority. In addition, some stakeholders said that updating and assessing CWPPs is important to maintaining their usefulness because some are outdated and many are not comprehensive, suggesting that the plans do not reflect changing circumstances such as increased housing development or altered landscape conditions. Community members in Southern California said their CWPP states that the plan should be updated every 5 years, or sooner if social, political, or economic factors warrant. This language aligns with the Forest Service’s Best Management Practices for Creating a Community Wildfire Protection Plan, which includes as a best practice to “quickly identify changes affecting the CWPP and adapt the plan to new conditions as they arise.” In some locations we visited, we found that CWPPs outlined communities’ plans to monitor and evaluate their risk-reduction efforts every 5 years or on an annual basis, such as in Central Oregon’s Greater La Pine CWPP. Forest Service and Interior officials said they participate in community efforts to develop and implement CWPPs, but they said it is not their role to direct communities about how and when to develop and maintain CWPPs or to oversee their implementation. As another way to improve collaborative planning, a senior NPS official and community members in California said the frequency of collaborative in-person meetings ahead of fire seasons should increase. For example, these community members said it would be beneficial to resume pre-fire season meetings that the community formerly held with local fire chiefs, state and county officials, and Eldorado National Forest officials, during which participants discussed issues such as resources and evacuation plans in the event of a wildfire. These community members said these meetings were a good way to foster trust and develop relationships, thereby increasing the chances of a successful response in the event of a wildland fire. Many federal officials and stakeholders said that expanding the amount of education provided to communities about the benefits of wildland fire and the steps individuals can take to reduce their risk could help reduce wildland fire risk to communities. Some stakeholders said it is important to provide more education on the ecological role of fire and the benefits it can provide. For example, a representative of the Southern Group of State Foresters said it would be helpful for private landowners across the United States to understand the benefits of prescribed burning because this could help landowners reduce risk on their properties and become more accepting of prescribed burning as a treatment on adjacent public lands. Some federal officials and stakeholders also said that expanding education about mitigation steps communities and individuals can take can help reduce risk. For example, some federal officials and stakeholders said sharing success stories about ways communities have reduced their wildland fire risk could help increase awareness about actions other communities could take. Some community members also said that tailored and more creative public education materials (i.e., those that reflect the unique topography, vegetation, culture, and building type of a particular community) describing steps individuals can take to reduce their wildland fire risk could prompt homeowners to act. For example, community members in Estes Park, Colorado, said that their county’s Firewise materials were tailored to reflect the community’s characteristics. These community members said the Colorado State Forest Service has provided such materials to counties in Colorado for approximately 20 years. According to 2006 and 2013 Forest Service reports, among the key ingredients for successful educational programs are publications that are geared toward specific geographic areas, as well as varied educational approaches and information pathways that meet differing learning styles. Some federal officials and stakeholders said that a clearinghouse that provides information about resources could help communities better understand actions they could take to reduce their risk. Interior Office of Wildland Fire officials said that a cooperative effort between the Forest Service and the Interior agencies resulted in a website, www.forestsandrangelands.gov, that provides fire, fuels, and land management information to government officials, land and fire management professionals, businesses, communities, and other interested organizations and individuals. Many federal officials and stakeholders said that increasing fire prevention efforts could help reduce wildland fire risk to communities, because many wildland fires are caused by humans. According to the National Interagency Fire Center, from 2001 to 2011, approximately 85 percent of wildland fires in the United States were caused by humans. Some federal officials we interviewed said consistent prevention messaging across locations, such as through the nationwide Smokey Bear campaign, is important; this is because it helps the public identify with the message no matter where they travel. Federal officials said that, in addition, targeting prevention messages to specific groups is important because the origin of human-caused fires varies depending on the location and characteristics of the community. For example, some areas may have more instances of juvenile arson, while other areas may have more instances of campers not fully extinguishing their campfires. A senior Forest Service official said that communities can benefit from developing prevention plans that identify a targeted prevention audience. Otherwise, this official said, communities and federal officials “throw darts at a board” rather than targeting prevention efforts at specific fire-causing activities unique to a particular area. Similarly, Oregon Department of Forestry officials said that better studies and analyses on how human- caused fires start could help target prevention efforts. Both Forest Service and Interior officials, however, said limited resources affect their ability to take additional steps to increase targeted prevention messaging. Many community and tribal members said that improving their timber- processing capability could help reduce wildland fire risk. Some said that their community’s timber-processing capability no longer exists, thereby affecting the market for timber or other materials removed as part of fuel reduction projects. Community members in northern California said limited timber-processing capability affects their ability to process the vegetation removed as part of fuel reduction efforts. Because timber is valuable to some communities, the ability to process it can help support jobs and the local economy. Apache-Sitgreaves National Forest officials in Arizona cited the usefulness of establishing biomass processing facilities near communities, noting that such facilities located near the neighboring community of Snowflake have helped facilitate a local timber- processing market. One stakeholder said a more developed biomass industry could help reduce wildland fire risk by providing an outlet for removed vegetation but noted that it is a more localized solution that may not work in every community. The Forest Service has multiple efforts aimed at maintaining and spurring the timber industry. For example, through its Wood Innovations grant program, formerly known as the “Woody Biomass Utilization Grant” program, the Forest Service has awarded grants to stimulate widespread use of forest byproducts for renewable energy, wood products, and innovative wood building materials. From fiscal years 2005 through 2016, the program awarded more than $54 million to more than 200 grant recipients, including small businesses, non-profit organizations, tribes, and state agencies. Many federal officials and stakeholders said that increased state and local adoption of laws and ordinances that encourage fire-resistant building and the removal of potentially flammable vegetation around structures could help reduce wildland fire risk. Some stakeholders also said that local nonfederal land-use plans should discourage development in areas at high risk from wildland fire. A 2013 Forest Service study found that 91 percent of WUI residents interviewed in California, where defensible space ordinances are in place, have lowered fire risk by removing flammable vegetation from their properties. Community members in western Colorado said it would be helpful if communities that develop such ordinances track their effectiveness in reducing wildland fire risk and publicize the results to help other communities make informed decisions about implementing their own ordinances. Community members in central Florida said that without such ordinances, homeowners and developers are less likely to take steps to reduce their risk. Some stakeholders said that increasing communities’ responsibility for the costs of suppressing fires could create an incentive for communities to take actions to reduce their wildland fire risk. One state recently took action to create such an incentive. In 2016, the Utah state legislature passed a law under which the state will assume certain wildland fire suppression costs for local governments that implement prevention, preparedness, and mitigation actions to reduce the risk and cost of wildfire. Local governments that do not implement such actions will be responsible for wildland fire costs within their jurisdictions. This new law was developed with the involvement of the Utah Association of Counties, the Utah League of Cities and Towns, the Utah State Fire Chiefs Association, local fire departments, various policy workgroups, and others. Many federal officials and stakeholders said that it can be helpful for insurance companies to provide incentives such as discounts or lower rates on insurance premiums for actions homeowners take to reduce their vulnerability to wildfire. Such discounts are provided in some areas; for example, according to the National Fire Protection Association, one insurance company provides homeowners in Arizona, California, Colorado, New Mexico, Oregon, Texas, and Utah with a discount on their insurance premiums if they are located in a Firewise-designated community. Stakeholders in Southern California also said some insurance companies have refused to provide homeowner’s insurance to property owners unless they undertake risk-reducing actions. For example, these stakeholders said that property owners in a community identified as being at particularly high wildland fire risk successfully obtained insurance only after using fire-safe building materials on their homes and other structures and clearing their properties of vegetation within 200 feet of their structures. Some federal officials and stakeholders, however, suggested that the effects of such insurance incentives may be limited. For example, a senior Forest Service official said insurance discounts may not be large enough to incentivize property owners to make risk-reducing changes. This official also noted that providing discounts to homeowners in Firewise communities does not guarantee that every homeowner within the community has taken action to reduce risk. Similarly, a 2016 review by Headwaters Economics reported, based in part on conversations with insurance industry experts, that it is unlikely that insurance rates and policies alone will determine whether a landowner decides to build a new home on wildfire-prone land. The 2015 Forest Stewards Guild report stated that some residents see insurance as a substitute for risk-reducing efforts, and that insurance therefore becomes a disincentive to such efforts. Abnormally dense accumulations of vegetation, combined with drought and other climate stressors, have contributed to larger and more severe wildland fires; at the same time, more people are choosing to live in fire- prone locations. Because fire can cross jurisdictions, efforts to reduce the risk of fire to communities involve a multitude of entities working together, including federal land management agencies, state and local governments, Indian tribes, and others. One area of focus for both federal and nonfederal entities has been the development of the Cohesive Strategy, which emphasizes the importance of coordination across entities and frames comprehensive national goals for mitigating the risk of wildland fire. However, WFLC has not developed performance measures to assess the combined efforts of federal and nonfederal participants in meeting the goals of the Cohesive Strategy. The Forest Service and Interior each have performance measures to monitor and assess their wildland fire management efforts, but those measures apply to the agencies individually and do not represent the set of national measures called for in the Cohesive Strategy. By working with the interagency body WFLC to establish such measures, the Forest Service and Interior, together with federal and nonfederal partners, could better assess national progress toward achieving the goals of the Cohesive Strategy. To help determine the extent to which the goals of the Cohesive Strategy are being met, we recommend that the Secretaries of Agriculture and the Interior direct the Chief of the Forest Service and the Director of the Office of Wildland Fire, respectively, to work with WFLC to develop measures to assess national progress toward achieving the strategy’s goals. We provided a draft of this report for review and comment to the Departments of Agriculture and the Interior. We received written comments from the Forest Service (responding on behalf of the Department of Agriculture), which are reproduced in appendix VII. In its letter, and in a subsequent discussion with the Forest Service audit liaison, the Forest Service stated that it generally agreed with our findings and recommendation, and that it is committed to implementing the Cohesive Strategy and will continue to work with WFLC and other entities towards reducing the risk of wildland fire on all lands in the United States. We also received written comments from Interior, which are reproduced in appendix VIII. Interior did not concur with our recommendation, citing three primary areas of disagreement. First, while acknowledging that measures to assess national progress toward achieving the goals of the Cohesive Strategy could be beneficial, Interior noted in its letter that the Wildland Fire Executive Council had previously determined that instituting the measures that had been presented to it would place undue burden on the agencies and nonfederal partners. Interior also stated that assessing national progress toward achieving the Cohesive Strategy’s goals would cost taxpayers more than it would save, and cited a 2013 study that noted the challenging nature of efforts to assess the effectiveness of fuel reduction and restoration treatments. More recently, however, as we note in our report, a December 2016 WFLC report stated that the use of research findings, remote sensing, and modelling can help quantify the effects of activities over time and can contribute to showing accountability and success in meeting the goals of the Cohesive Strategy. During our review, Interior officials said they had not had sufficient time to determine which, if any, research findings could be useful in this effort, and Interior’s letter does not refer to this aspect of the 2016 WFLC report. As a result, it is not clear whether Interior has fully considered the potential for using research findings or other tools described in the 2016 report to measure national progress in a cost-effective way. Second, Interior stated that in 2014 it changed its strategic performance metrics to demonstrate departmental progress toward meeting the strategy’s goals. Our report describes an example of one such departmental measure that is consistent with the Cohesive Strategy’s emphasis on resilient landscapes. However, as we note in our report, agency performance measures are intended to separately assess each agency’s performance—or, in some cases the performance of specific programs—and do not represent a set of measures to assess national progress toward meeting the Cohesive Strategy’s goals, as called for in the strategy. Such measures could, as noted in the Cohesive Strategy, allow Congress and other stakeholders to monitor and assess progress toward achieving the strategy’s goals. Interior did not indicate any steps it would take to meet the Cohesive Strategy’s call for measuring national, rather than departmental, progress in meeting the strategy’s goals. Third, Interior noted that federal entities cannot control or mandate response or participation from non-federal partners. However, given the Cohesive Strategy’s emphasis on collaboration between federal and nonfederal entities to achieve its goals, the WFLC—as the interagency body charged with implementing the strategy—is an appropriate forum for working to develop measures. While we understand that federal entities cannot control or mandate response or participation from non-federal partners, we believe that, as members of WFLC, Interior and other federal agencies can provide leadership in helping ensure accountability for the mutually agreed upon goals of the Cohesive Strategy. Interior also provided technical comments regarding the Cohesive Strategy. In response, we incorporated additional information to note that implementation of the Cohesive Strategy is not separately funded. As agreed with your offices, unless you publicly announce the contents of this report earlier, we plan no further distribution until 30 days from the report date. At that time, we will send copies to the appropriate congressional committees, the Secretaries of Agriculture and the Interior, and other interested parties. In addition, the report will be available at no charge on the GAO website at http://www.gao.gov. If you or your staff members have any questions regarding this report, please contact me at (202) 512-3841 or fennella@gao.gov. Contact points for our Offices of Congressional Relations and Public Affairs may be found on the last page of this report. GAO staff who made key contributions to the report are listed in appendix IX. This report examines (1) factors federal officials and nonfederal stakeholders cited as affecting federal-nonfederal collaboration aimed at reducing wildland fire risk to communities and (2) actions federal officials and nonfederal stakeholders said could help improve their ability to reduce wildland fire risk to communities. To perform this work, we reviewed various laws, policies, guidance, state and local zoning codes and ordinances, agency budget justifications, academic literature, and reviews related to federal wildland fire management. Among the laws we reviewed were the Federal Land Assistance, Management, and Enhancement Act; Healthy Forests Restoration Act of 2003; Good Neighbor Authority; Wyden Amendment; and Tribal Forest Protection Act of 2004. In addition, we reviewed policy documents and agency budget justifications, such as the 2009 Guidance for Implementation of Federal Wildland Fire Management Policy, the National Cohesive Wildland Fire Management Strategy, and the Forest Service fiscal year 2017 budget justification. We also reviewed other documents such as the 2014 Quadrennial Fire Review Final Report, the U.S. Global Change Research Program’s 2014 National Climate Assessment, Headwaters Economics’ paper Do Insurance Policies and Rates Influence Home Development on Fire-Prone Lands?, and the Forest Stewards Guild report Evaluating the Effectiveness of Wildfire Mitigation Activities in the Wildland-Urban Interface. We conducted a basic assessment of these studies’ methodologies, assumptions, and limitations and determined them to be sufficiently credible for our purposes. We also interviewed headquarters officials from each of the five federal land management agencies responsible for wildland fire management—the Forest Service in the Department of Agriculture and the Bureau of Indian Affairs, Bureau of Land Management, Fish and Wildlife Service, and National Park Service in the Department of the Interior—as well as Interior’s Office of Wildland Fire. Because our report addresses reducing risk to communities, we focused our review on federal wildland fire management activities intended to reduce risk before a potential wildland fire occurs, through fire preparedness, fuel reduction, prevention, and education. To address our first objective, we interviewed fire management officials from 10 federal land management units, such as national forests and national parks, as well as representatives of communities near these lands. We selected land management units from each of the five federal agencies using the following criteria: the size of the estimated population in nearby wildland-urban interface areas, as defined by the Forest Service, with high wildland fire hazard potential; the size in acres of the land management unit; input from regional land management agency officials; and the geographic location of the land management unit, with units selected to provide geographic diversity. We then selected communities adjacent to the federal land management units by considering input from local land management agency officials. For each community selected, we interviewed representatives from nonfederal entities with which land management unit officials interacted; these representatives included county officials, local fire department officials, and homeowners. Using these criteria, we selected land management units and adjacent communities in five states: Arizona, California, Colorado, Florida, and Oregon. During our interviews with federal officials and community representatives, we asked about ways in which federal and nonfederal entities collaborated and factors that enhanced or hindered their ability to collaborate. In addition, for the five states we selected, we interviewed officials with state wildland fire and forestry agencies. To gain a wider range of perspectives from states that were not included in our site selection, we interviewed officials with the National Association of State Foresters, the Southern Group of State Foresters, and the Northeastern Area Association of State Foresters, which represent states across the country. In addition, to gain a better perspective on the Cohesive Strategy, we interviewed members of the Wildland Fire Leadership Council (WFLC) and the three regional committees—Northeast, Southeast, and West—responsible for overseeing the Cohesive Strategy’s implementation. We also interviewed representatives of nongovernmental organizations that were identified by federal officials we interviewed or in reports we reviewed as being involved in federal- nonfederal efforts to reduce wildland fire risk. During these interviews we asked about ways in which they collaborated with federal land management agencies and factors that enhanced or hindered their ability to collaborate. Table 2 provides a list of nonfederal associations, organizations, and committees included in our review. We reviewed and analyzed interviewees’ responses and identified broad categories of factors they said enhance or hinder federal-nonfederal collaboration to reduce fire risk to communities and actions they said could improve their ability to reduce such risk. In response to our interview questions about factors that affect collaboration efforts aimed at reducing risk to communities, officials and stakeholders described factors that we defined as having affected direct collaboration and indirect collaboration. For example, direct collaboration (i.e., situations involving a tangible relationship between two or more parties) includes federal policies and authorities that require or enable collaboration. Factors that affect indirect collaboration (i.e., situations in which actions by one entity may affect other entities attempting to achieve a similar outcome) include community education, which can affect communities’ ability to take risk reduction actions that may or may not include collaboration with others. We include both types of factors in our report, distinguishing between direct and indirect collaboration as appropriate. Based on the frequency of factors identified, as well as information we obtained through our review of documents mentioned above related to this topic, we reported on factors associated with nine categories. The list of factors and associated definitions we used for analytical purposes were: Federal authorities: laws that authorize federal and nonfederal entities to conduct risk-reducing efforts across jurisdictions. State and local authorities: state and local laws or ordinances that may require homeowners, businesses, or communities to conduct certain risk-reducing actions or meet specified building requirements. Initiatives: federal efforts aimed at conducting cross-jurisdictional projects to reduce risk. Joint planning: federal-nonfederal efforts to discuss and document future risk reduction activities. Agency resources for collaboration: the ability of federal and nonfederal entities to share staff or funding and the presence of staff or funding to engage in collaborative activities. Leadership: efforts to collaborate, communicate, and seek input from others, among other characteristics. Education: efforts to educate individuals about steps they can take to reduce risk. Wildfire prevention messaging: efforts to provide prevention information or materials. Community engagement: the extent to which communities are aware of and engaged in taking actions to reduce risk, such as establishing defensible space. Two analysts coded each response into these categories. Because many of the responses were broad in nature and could be categorized into multiple categories, analysts verified each other’s categorizations. After completing the categorization of responses, we assessed the frequency with which responses occurred in each category to help identify factors to discuss in our report. Our report generally does not discuss infrequently identified factors. To address our second objective, we interviewed federal officials and nonfederal entities described above to obtain information about actions they said could reduce risk to communities from wildland fire. We categorized and coded their responses using the method described above. Based on the frequency of solutions identified, as well as information we obtained through our review of documents mentioned above related to this topic, we reported on solutions associated with seven categories: improving implementation of the Cohesive Strategy, increasing collaborative planning, expanding education, increasing prevention efforts, improving timber-processing capability, adopting state and local ordinances, and providing insurance incentives. To increase our understanding of the actions identified, we reviewed information about related programs and initiatives, including information about the Forest Service’s Wood Innovations grant program, documents such as Best Management Practices for Creating a Community Wildfire Protection Plan, and information about the Smokey Bear campaign. We reviewed the Cohesive Strategy and action plans for implementing it, various “success story” project descriptions, guiding documents for WFLC and its regional committees, and other relevant documents. We also reviewed Cohesive Strategy implementation guidance and a 2016 report on the Cohesive Strategy by WFLC’s National Strategic Committee. We then compared agency efforts to assess progress toward achieving the Cohesive Strategy’s goals against guidance contained in the strategy and associated action plans. To obtain additional insight into the use of performance information on the part of federal agencies, we reviewed our previous reports related to interagency strategies and agencies’ efforts to collaborate. We also reviewed various state and local ordinances that encourage fire-resistant building and the removal of potentially flammable vegetation around structures and that discourage development in areas at high risk from wildland fire. In addition, upon completing our analysis of interviewee responses, we followed up with Forest Service and Interior headquarters officials to learn the extent to which the agencies were implementing or considering the actions the interviewees suggested. For both objectives, when providing general statements to describe factors that affect collaboration and actions to reduce risk, we use the term stakeholders to refer to representatives of the nonfederal entities listed above. When describing individual examples, we often refer to the specific type of stakeholder, such as community members. In addition, because this is a nonprobability sample, the information we report is not generalizable to all land management units and communities. It does not represent a comprehensive list of collaborative programs or efforts nationwide or in these states but, rather, provides illustrative examples from a geographically diverse range of land management units and communities that are at high risk of experiencing wildland fire. We conducted this performance audit from October 2015 to May 2017 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. Table 3 shows various characteristics of the communities included in our review. Table 4 describes several federal laws aimed at reducing wildland fire risk through collaboration. Several federal officials and stakeholders we interviewed said that some national and state air quality standards under the Clean Air Act have the effect of limiting fuel reduction treatments that rely on prescribed burning. Under the act, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) establishes standards for controlling air pollution. Pollutants in smoke, including those emitted from prescribed fires, can cause health issues and also cause air quality to exceed EPA’s health standards for fine particulate matter and ozone. Wildfire smoke can reach hazardous levels in downwind communities for long periods of time, while prescribed fire can cause nuisance and shorter but still significant smoke impacts. To help ensure that EPA’s standards are met, state officials responsible for enforcing the act might not in all cases provide land managers with the permits necessary to conduct prescribed burns. Federal agencies have taken steps to address the issue of balancing the need to protect public health with conducting prescribed burns as a method of fuel reduction. Specifically, since 2015, the Wildland Fire Leadership Council’s priorities have included smoke and air quality, and in January 2016, EPA and the Departments of Agriculture and the Interior issued a joint Wildland Fire and Air Quality summary. Among other things, the summary describes EPA’s commitment to working with land managers to effectively use prescribed fire to reduce the effects of wildfire-related emissions. EPA’s Exceptional Events Rule provides regulatory relief for states that exceed national air quality standards because of emissions from certain sources of pollution, including wildfires and certain prescribed fires. EPA finalized updates to the rule in October 2016 intended to simplify and shorten the process for state air quality agencies to address the impacts of wildfire smoke in their air quality plans. EPA also released a guidance document in 2016 intended to help state air quality agencies develop supporting information for wildfires that affect monitored ozone concentrations. This appendix provides information about selected federal programs that provide risk-reduction funding to states and localities. The Forest Service’s State Fire Assistance (SFA) program provides financial assistance through partnership agreements with state foresters for fire management activities, including helping communities become fire adapted. According to the Forest Service’s fiscal year 2017 budget justification, SFA is a critical part of the agency’s efforts to reduce wildland fire risk to communities, residents, property, and firefighters because it helps ensure that state, local, and private landowners have the capacity and tools they need to prepare for, respond to, and mitigate fire risk in the wildland-urban interface (WUI) and other critical areas. In each fiscal year from 2014 through 2016, approximately $78 million was enacted for the program. Of the total $78 million enacted for SFA in fiscal year 2015, $15.9 million was spent on hazardous fuel reduction treatments in the WUI, directly paying for the treatment of 148,020 acres of hazardous fuel and contributing to the treatment of another 126,368 acres with in-kind partner support, according to the Forest Service’s fiscal year 2017 budget justification. In addition, SFA funding supports national partnerships and agreements, including, among others, the National Fire Protection Association’s Firewise program, the wildfire prevention campaign with the Ad Council, and The Nature Conservancy Fire Learning Network. The Forest Service’s Volunteer Fire Assistance (VFA) program provides technical and financial assistance to local volunteer fire departments serving rural communities with a population of 10,000 or fewer. According to the Forest Service’s fiscal year 2017 budget justification, rural fire departments represent the first line of defense in addressing fires and other emergencies, and without the cooperation of rural fire departments, the agency would be unable to provide the level of fire response needed to keep fires near communities small. In each fiscal year from 2014 through 2016, $13 million was enacted for the program. In 2015, this funding helped 9,318 communities to train 22,272 firefighters and purchase, rehabilitate, and maintain $8.1 million in equipment, according to the 2017 budget justification. The Department of the Interior’s Rural Fire Assistance program (RFA) provided assistance in education and training, as well as supplies and equipment, to rural fire districts. However, funding for this program ended in fiscal year 2012 because of the increased availability of other fire assistance grant programs outside of Interior, according to officials with Interior’s Office of Wildland Fire. Interior’s Community Assistance is intended to support activities that improve and sustain community and individual responsibilities to adapt to, prepare for, and respond to wildfire. Unlike the Forest Service’s VFA or Interior’s now-expired RFA, Interior does not manage Community Assistance as a grant program, but as an activity under the existing wildland fire management programs of fuel reduction and preparedness, with funding levels determined by each Interior agency. Interior officials estimated that overall Community Assistance funding decreased from fiscal year 2009 through fiscal year 2013. For example, during this period, funding for Community Assistance decreased from an estimated $4.5 million to $2.1 million for BLM and from an estimated $1.2 million to $355,000 for Bureau of Indian Affairs, according to these officials. Since 2014, the Department of the Interior’s Office of Wildland Fire has been developing a Risk-Based Wildland Fire Management model, which it plans to use to help support decisions about how to distribute funding for preparedness and fuel reduction to four Interior agencies: Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA), Bureau of Land Management (BLM), Fish and Wildlife Service, and National Park Service. The proposed system is to assess the probability and likely intensity of wildland fire, values at risk, and the expected value of acres likely to burn. Several Interior officials we interviewed raised concerns about the equity of the model because it makes determinations based on priority values at risk across the four Interior agencies, which can be challenging given the variation in agency missions and types of land they manage. For example, a threatened species located primarily on BLM lands may be among that agency’s highest priorities, but a forested area relied upon by an Indian tribe for its livelihood may be among BIA’s highest priorities. We found in 2015 that Interior officials said they expected to identify the prioritized values and issue guidance on the proposed system by the end of calendar year 2015 and use its results to inform their fiscal year 2016 funding distributions to the four agencies. As of February 2017, officials with Interior’s Office of Wildland Fire said they had not completed final revisions to the model but planned to do so in 2017. In addition to the individual named above, Steve Gaty (Assistant Director), Ulana M. Bihun, Mark Braza, Richard P. Johnson, and Keesha Luebke made key contributions to this report. Important contributions were also made by Martin (Greg) Campbell, William Carrigg, Lee Carroll, Charles Culverwell, Christopher P. Currie, Dan Royer, and Sarah Veale.","Dense vegetation, drought, and other factors have resulted in more severe wildland fires in recent years. At the same time, development in and around wildlands continues to increase, with some communities experiencing devastating effects from wildland fire. To reduce risk to communities, federal agencies and nonfederal stakeholders can collaborate in various ways. GAO was asked to review collaboration to reduce wildland fire risk to communities. This report examines federal officials' and stakeholders' views on (1) factors that affect federal-nonfederal collaboration aimed at reducing wildland fire risk to communities and (2) actions that could improve their ability to reduce risk to communities. GAO reviewed laws and documents about collaboration on wildland fire management; compared agency efforts with guidance; and interviewed officials from a nongeneralizable sample of 10 federal land management units selected based on wildland fire potential, geographic diversity, and other factors. GAO also interviewed stakeholders including community members near the selected units and representatives of nonfederal entities involved in fire risk-reduction efforts. Officials GAO interviewed from the five federal agencies responsible for wildland fire management—the Forest Service within the Department of Agriculture and the Bureau of Indian Affairs, Bureau of Land Management, Fish and Wildlife Service, and National Park Service within the Department of the Interior—and nonfederal stakeholders, including state and local officials, homeowners, and representatives of nongovernmental organizations, identified several factors as affecting federal-nonfederal collaboration aimed at reducing wildland fire risk to communities. In some cases these factors were cited as enhancing collaboration, while in other cases they were cited as hindering it. Among the factors identified were federal authorities, agency initiatives, joint community-level planning, and others. For example, several officials and stakeholders cited laws such as the Good Neighbor Authority and Tribal Forest Protection Act of 2004 as enhancing collaboration because they provide federal and nonfederal entities the authority to work across jurisdictions on projects to reduce risk. In addition, several officials and stakeholders cited the 2014 National Cohesive Wildland Fire Management Strategy (Cohesive Strategy) as helpful for collaboration because it emphasizes the importance of coordination across multiple agencies and includes comprehensive fire management goals. In contrast, some officials and stakeholders said collaboration on certain types of projects was hindered by the difficulty in sharing project costs between federal and nonfederal entities. Federal officials and nonfederal stakeholders also identified several actions they said could improve federal agencies' and nonfederal entities' ability to reduce wildland fire risk to communities. Among the actions cited was improving the implementation of the Cohesive Strategy. Some agency officials and stakeholders noted the importance of increasing accountability for implementing the Cohesive Strategy, such as through the use of performance measures. The strategy states that its success depends in part on monitoring and accountability, and calls for national outcome measures. This is consistent with previous GAO findings regarding national strategies. However, GAO found that the Wildland Fire Leadership Council (WFLC)—the interagency body charged with overseeing and implementing the Cohesive Strategy and which includes the Forest Service and Interior as members—has not developed measures to assess progress on the part of federal and nonfederal participants in meeting the national goals of the Cohesive Strategy. In 2013, WFLC proposed several measures but concluded that implementing them could place undue burden on the agencies and nonfederal partners. In 2016, however, WFLC reported that recent research findings could help quantify the strategy's effects over time. By working with WFLC to develop such measures, the Forest Service and Interior, together with federal and nonfederal partners, could better assess national progress toward achieving the goals of the Cohesive Strategy. Federal officials and nonfederal stakeholders also identified actions that, while not necessarily within the federal agencies' control, could be taken to reduce wildland fire risk to communities. For example, these actions include adopting state laws that require property owners to take risk-reducing actions such as using fire-resistant building materials or reducing vegetation around their homes. Some states have adopted laws to promote such actions. GAO recommends that the Forest Service and Interior work with WFLC to develop measures to assess progress toward achieving the Cohesive Strategy's goals. The Forest Service agreed with GAO's recommendation, while Interior did not. GAO believes the recommendation is valid, as discussed in the report.",govreport
"The Foundation, originally incorporated in Washington, D.C., in 1985 as the U.S. Committee for the Battle of Normandy Museum, is a private nonprofit organization, tax-exempt under section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code and is not part of the U.S. government. In published literature, the Foundation has described the purposes of its programs to be (1) honoring America’s World War II veterans and (2) teaching future generations the causes and consequences of World War II. The Foundation’s activities, which center around promoting public awareness of the historical significance of America’s participation in the liberation of Europe, have included building and promoting the Memorial Garden to commemorate D-Day and the Battle of Normandy; providing financial support for a French-owned and operated World War II memorial museum in the city of Caen, France; circulating newsletters to contributing members of the Foundation; sponsoring a Normandy scholar program, which educates university students in the history of World War II and the Battle of Normandy; and planning and promoting a Wall of Liberty in Normandy to honor World War II veterans involved in the European theater of operations. On October 14, 1992, the World War II 50th Anniversary Commemorative Coins Act was passed, directing the Secretary of the U.S. Treasury to mint and issue commemorative World War II coins with specified denominations and metallic content. It also directed the Treasury to sell the coins at a price equal to the sum of (1) the face value of the coins, (2) the cost of designing and issuing the coins, and (3) surcharges. The Coins Act specified that the first $3 million in surcharges received by the Treasury from the sale of coins be transferred to the Battle of Normandy Foundation and used by the Foundation to create, endow, and dedicate, on the 50th Anniversary of D-Day, a United States D-Day and Battle of Normandy Memorial in Normandy. The Coins Act also specified that the next $7 million in surcharges received from the sale of coins be made available to the American Battle Monuments Commission for the purpose of establishing a World War II memorial in or around Washington, D.C. Any amounts received by the Treasury in excess of $10 million were to be distributed to the two entities in the same 30 percent to 70 percent ratio. The coins were minted and sold by the Treasury and $3 million was transferred to the Foundation in 1993. In March 1994, the U.S. Mint reported to the Congress that, through February 1994, $7.6 million in surcharges had been generated and that it would continue coin sales through June 1994 but was not expecting any significant increase to the overall total. Therefore, additional funds are not expected to be available to the Foundation under the Coins Act. The Coins Act stipulated that the funds were also to be used by the Foundation to encourage and support visits to the memorial by United States citizens, especially students. We are required by the act to audit the Foundation’s use of any Treasury funds it receives under the act. In September 1993, the Foundation obtained approximately 2.5 acres of land adjacent to the World War II memorial museum in Caen, under a 99-year lease with the local government, and the Foundation constructed the Memorial Garden on this land. While the lease calls for a nominal annual rental payment of one French franc, it requires the Foundation to fund the costs of operating and maintaining the Memorial Garden and land for the entire lease term. In 1993, the Foundation began promoting a Wall of Liberty, which it planned to build in Normandy. For a fee of $40, the name of an American who served in the European theater of operations (which included Europe, North Africa, and the Mediterranean) is registered for inscription on the still-to-be constructed wall. The Foundation stated that it requested additional financial support for the wall from individuals, corporations, and other foundations in order to register veterans who may be unable to contribute the $40. The Foundation has employed independent certified public accountants (CPA) to perform annual audits of its financial statements. The Foundation’s independent CPA firm issued its most recent audit report on the Foundation’s calendar year 1993 financial statements in late August 1994. In the summer of 1993, allegations of financial impropriety were made against the Foundation and its then president, Anthony C. Stout, in a series of articles which appeared in a Washington, D.C., newspaper. These, and certain other allegations which focused on the viability of the Wall of Liberty project, subsequently appeared in the national media. On July 30, 1993, the Foundation’s Board of Directors appointed a special committee to investigate certain allegations, and the committee employed another public accounting firm to assist it by reviewing certain aspects of the Foundation’s financial management. In January 1994, the special committee concluded its investigation and reported that the Foundation had met its stated corporate goals and that accusations against Mr. Stout were unsupported. Under the Coins Act, we are required to audit the transfer of surcharge coin proceeds—and any interest earned thereon—from the Treasury to the Foundation and determine if these funds were used for the design and construction of the Memorial Garden in Normandy. During our audit of the Memorial Garden, we noted significant financial problems at the Foundation and received congressional inquiries regarding the Wall of Liberty and the Foundation’s finances. We, therefore, made additional inquiries regarding the current overall financial condition of the Foundation and the financial condition’s impact on operations, including the current and future maintenance of the Memorial Garden and the progress of the wall project. Also, we were asked by congressional committees to follow up on three specific media allegations involving the Foundation. In carrying out our work, we reviewed historical and current Foundation financial information, including audited financial statements, federal income tax returns, minutes of Board of Directors’ meetings, pertinent agreements, and other financial reports; interviewed current and former Foundation officials regarding financial matters, including management’s plans for current and future financial operations; obtained from the U.S. Mint, Department of the Treasury, documentation on the payment of surcharge coin proceeds to the Foundation; verified selected interest income payments to Foundation bank accounts and performed analytical reviews of selected interest payments through June 30, 1994; traced a sample representing over 95 percent of Memorial Garden design and construction costs through June 30, 1994, to payment vouchers, invoices, and construction manager approvals; traced selected accounting, legal, and consulting costs for the Memorial Garden through June 30, 1994, to payment vouchers and invoices; reviewed the computations and reasonableness of the Foundation’s general and administrative overhead allocation rates and selected salary allocations charged to the Memorial Garden project through June 30, 1994; examined progress and final construction photographs of the Memorial Garden and interviewed officials at the office of the construction manager in New York City who were responsible for the Memorial Garden construction; read the Independent Review Committee’s January 7, 1994, report on its investigation and reviewed the work performed by the public accounting firm which assisted the committee; interviewed a U.S. Department of Defense official who was referred to in a newspaper article as implying that the Foundation had acted improperly in promoting tours to Normandy; and read the travel brochure published by the tour company that contracted with the Foundation. Since the Foundation received a $3 million federal award in 1993 for the Memorial Garden, the Foundation’s independent CPA firm, in accordance with Office of Management and Budget Circular A-133, reported on the Foundation’s internal control structure and its compliance with applicable laws and regulations. We relied on these reports and the work of the CPA firm, and did not perform an independent comprehensive review of the Foundation’s overall accounting system or internal controls. We performed our work primarily in Washington, D.C., from September 1993 through August 1994. Our audit was performed in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. The Foundation has experienced significant managerial, financial, and internal control problems, and its liabilities substantially exceed its assets. The Foundation’s precarious financial condition casts doubt on whether it can continue its operations. Financial management problems at the Foundation were acknowledged in the January 1994 report of the special committee which investigated media allegations against the Foundation and Mr. Stout. In a November 1993 report, the public accounting firm which assisted the Foundation’s special committee, identified internal control weaknesses and recommended improving the Foundation’s internal controls governing financial management. Financial management problems included weak internal controls over transactions between the Foundation and its now former president, Anthony C. Stout, and a lack of formal written policies and procedures for travel and expense reimbursements. The committee report recommended specific management changes including that a full-time chief executive be employed as president in place of Mr. Stout, who had generally held the position on a part-time, unsalaried basis, and that Mr. Stout be elected Chairman of the Foundation’s Board of Directors or its Executive Committee. The Foundation announced 26 steps to resolve identified problems, including plans to require formal Board approval of all related party transactions, the adoption of formal written travel and expense reimbursement policies, and the hiring of a full-time president. Following the committee’s report, the Foundation experienced turnover in its management and leadership. Mr. Stout resigned as president in February 1994 and was elected by the Board as Chairman of the Foundation’s Executive Committee. The Foundation hired a new full-time president; however, he resigned the position after 3 months and another new president was hired. The Foundation’s executive director resigned in April 1994. In June 1994, about the time of the D-Day commemoration and the dedication of the Memorial Garden, several Foundation staff members were suspended after publicly attributing Foundation financial difficulties to Mr. Stout’s interference and financial mismanagement. At the same time, the Foundation’s recently-hired president also resigned. Mr. Stout resigned as Chairman of the Executive Committee in late June, but remained on the Board of Directors. In July 1994, the Foundation announced a major management restructuring which included electing two new co-chairmen of the Board of Directors, appointing a new president (the Foundation’s fourth since February) and a new chief financial officer, and rehiring of the executive director who had resigned in April. In addition, the Foundation announced that Mr. Stout had resigned from the Board of Directors. Foundation management told us that it had formulated a business plan designed to place the Foundation on a financially viable course and that it had developed a list of operational reforms to correct deficiencies in the Foundation’s corporate governance and financial management. The Foundation’s recently issued 1993 audited financial statements show that as of December 31, 1993, it had accumulated a financial deficit of about $727,000. The notes to the financial statements stated that the Foundation has been the subject of controversy in certain newspaper articles and that this has affected fund-raising. In July 1994, Foundation officials gave us a document which disclosed that the Foundation’s liabilities continued to substantially exceed its assets. The document also showed that of the approximately $2.5 million in contributions it had received for its Wall of Liberty project, about $1.1 million had been used by the Foundation to pay for other projects’ costs and operating expenses. Based on the information contained in Foundation financial records and reports, and interviews with Foundation officials, it appears that unless the Foundation obtains significant amounts of new donations or other sources of funding, now and in the future, the Foundation will not be able to meet its financial and operational responsibilities related to the Memorial Garden. Also, the precarious financial condition casts doubt on whether other projects, such as the Wall of Liberty, will proceed. Our audit showed that the Treasury transferred $3 million in surcharge coin proceeds to the Foundation on June 21, 1993. These funds were deposited in Foundation bank accounts, and as of June 30, 1994, interest of $73,152 had been earned. Our audit also showed that total design, construction, and other costs of the Memorial Garden recorded by the Foundation through June 30, 1994, were $3.6 million, and the $3.0 million received from the U.S. Treasury in Coins Act surcharge proceeds, plus interest earned thereon, were used toward funding these costs. As of June 30, 1994, the Foundation’s recorded cost included about $400,000 still owed to Memorial Garden contractors. In September 1993, the Foundation began construction of the Memorial Garden and dedicated it in a D-Day commemoration ceremony on June 5, 1994. The Memorial Garden is located in the city of Caen, adjacent to a World War II museum known as Le Memorial. The museum is operated by a French nonprofit organization whose majority shareholder is the city of Caen, and one of the Foundation’s projects has been to provide financial support to the museum. The Memorial Garden occupies approximately 2.5 acres and consists of a granite fountain shaped like a pair of hands, symbolizing the giving of American lives to save the European allies. The fountain contains a “Wall of States,” which is a display of stones native to the 50 states and several U.S. territories. On the stones are engraved seals, flags, or military emblems. A waterfall flows from the fountain into a pond. The stone walkway approach to the Memorial Garden winds through a grove of trees and is bordered by flowering shrubs and ornamental grasses. The Foundation’s direct and indirect costs for the Memorial Garden recorded as of June 30, 1994, are shown in table 1. Construction costs include the (1) cost and sculpturing of granite, (2) material and labor for concrete and forms for the fountain and other structures, and (3) landscaping. Design costs consist of the services provided by American and French architects. Accounting and legal costs include legal services from a French law firm, and consultants’ costs include those for photographs and security of the construction site. General and administrative costs consist primarily of travel costs and Foundation overhead charged to the project. The costs of the Memorial Garden have exceeded the amounts provided by the Coins Act, and additional Memorial Garden funding came, or needs to come, from other sources. Because of the Foundation’s current financial condition, it is uncertain whether the Foundation will be able to fund future costs of operating and maintaining the Memorial Garden. Congressional requesters asked us to follow up on three of the several allegations which initially appeared in a Washington, D.C., newspaper. Allegation one: The Foundation spent most of its revenues from 1986 to 1992 for purposes not related to its stated program activities. The Foundation, as a private, nonprofit corporation chartered in the District of Columbia, is required to conduct its activities in accordance with the District of Columbia Nonprofit Corporation Act and the Internal Revenue Code for tax exempt organizations. However, the Internal Revenue Service and the District of Columbia do not specify spending criteria for nonprofit organizations. The Council of Better Business Bureaus, which promotes ethical practices and promulgates operating standards for charitable organizations, suggests that organizations such as the Foundation annually spend at least 50 percent of their revenues on program activities directly related to their stated purpose. The National Charities Information Bureau, which promotes informed giving and a vigorous and responsive philanthropic sector, suggests in its standards that a charitable organization spend at least 60 percent of its annual expenses for program activities. The Foundation’s audited financial statements for 1986 through 1992, the period covered by the allegation, and other financial records, such as tax returns, showed that the Foundation had spent approximately 63 percent of its revenues—61 percent of its expenses—for its stated program activities, such as member services, museum support, and the Normandy scholar program. For 1993, the Foundation’s financial statements showed that the cost of program activities were about 83 percent of its revenues or 76 percent of its expenses. Allegation two: The Foundation inappropriately promoted tours to Normandy in 1993. It was alleged that the Foundation had inappropriately engaged a private tour company to assist it in promoting tours to Normandy in connection with the commemoration of the 50th anniversary of D-Day. Specifically, the allegation stated that the Foundation had been engaging in unethical and possibly illegal activities to promote the tours. The Coins Act, under which the Foundation received $3 million in surcharge coin funds, specifically called on the Foundation to create and dedicate a Normandy memorial and to encourage and support visits to the memorial by U.S. citizens, especially students. The Foundation, through competitive means, contracted with a travel agency for the purpose of facilitating travel services for Foundation members and others who planned to attend the commemorative events for the 50th anniversary of D-Day. At the request of the Department of Defense’s 50th Anniversary of World War II Commemoration Committee, the Army’s Office of General Counsel provided an opinion regarding the Foundation’s tour promotion activities. That opinion stated that the Foundation may designate whomever it wishes as its tour company, so long as the Foundation does not imply that the U.S. Government has made the designation. The travel brochure published by the tour company engaged by the Foundation makes no such implications and refers to the Battle of Normandy Foundation, indicating that the Foundation is a nonprofit organization coordinating a private-sector initiative for the 50th anniversary of D-Day. Allegation three: Anthony C. Stout’s private company, GIM Corp., owed rent to the Foundation for space it occupied under a sublease and in 1991, while Foundation president, Mr. Stout had the Foundation’s records altered to substitute the rent receivable with a GIM Corp. pledge for contributions that would not be honored. Foundation records show that while he was the Foundation’s president, Anthony C. Stout controlled a company, Government Investment Management Corporation (GIM Corp.), which periodically shared the cost of office space and certain personnel, including a chief financial officer, with the Foundation. Also, at various times, the Foundation and GIM Corp. each paid for expenses incurred by the other and the Foundation recorded receivables or payables to reflect these arrangements, commonly referred to as related party transactions. It was alleged that in 1991 Anthony C. Stout had the Foundation’s records altered to replace a $108,000 receivable from GIM Corp. with a promise from GIM Corp. to donate $30,000 a year for 4 years. It was further alleged that the amount of the pledge was subsequently reduced to an insignificant amount, implying that Mr. Stout did not intend to honor it. Foundation records show that in August 1989, GIM Corp. entered into a sublease agreement with the Foundation, to pay a portion of the Foundation’s rent. During the term of the sublease with GIM Corp., the Foundation recorded rental charges to GIM Corp. in its accounting records; however, these charges exceeded the amounts that were to be charged under the sublease. Certain of these charges were not paid and, therefore, contributed to the receivable from GIM Corp. reflected in Foundation accounting records. Foundation Board minutes indicate that GIM Corp. moved out of the Foundation’s offices in July 1991 and that the Foundation’s Treasurer adjusted the Foundation’s books to reduce the rent due from GIM Corp. Board minutes also reflect the unanimous Board approval of both the Treasurer’s adjustments and the cancellation of the sublease with GIM Corp. Our review confirmed that adjustments made to Foundation records to reduce amounts due from GIM Corp. brought rent charges more in line with the Foundation’s sublease agreement with GIM Corp. Foundation records also showed that the reduced receivable amount was subsequently paid by GIM Corp. In October 1991, Mr. Stout, acting on behalf of GIM Corp., pledged to the Foundation contributions totaling $120,000 over a 4-year period. In an October 1991 memorandum to the then chief financial officer, Mr. Stout stated that the pledge was made to provide the Foundation with an insurance policy against insufficient income and to accurately portray GIM Corp.’s future financial support to the Foundation. Through December 1993, Foundation records indicate that $90,000 of the $120,000 pledge had been paid. Foundation officials, commenting on a draft of this report, stated that it reflects accurately the decisions and actions which brought the Foundation to its present condition. (See appendix I.)

GAO found that: (1) the Foundation has experienced significant managerial, financial, and internal control problems; (2) it is uncertain whether the Foundation will be able to pay current and future operating costs for the Memorial Garden or fund other projects such as the Wall of Liberty, since its liabilities substantially exceed its assets and its management structure is unstable; (3) the Foundation spent $3 million in surcharge coin proceeds it received in 1993 for the design and construction of the United States Armed Forces Memorial Garden in accordance with the Commemorative Coins Act; (4) as of June 1994, the total recorded cost of the Memorial Garden was $3.6 million and the Foundation owed $400,000 to Memorial Garden contractors; (5) between 1986 and 1992, the Foundation spent 63 percent of its revenues on program activities; (6) in 1993, the Foundation spent 83 percent of its revenues on program activities; (7) the Foundation properly contracted with a private tour company to promote the Memorial's tour activities; (8) the Foundation recovered $90,000 of the $120,000 a private contractor owed the Foundation; and (9) Battle of Normandy Foundation officials concurred with the findings presented in the report.",govreport
"In 1980, the Congress passed the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA), which established the Superfund program to clean up highly contaminated hazardous waste sites. EPA administers the program, oversees cleanups performed by the parties responsible for contaminating the sites, and performs cleanups itself. State governments also have a role in the Superfund process. States may enter into contracts or cooperative agreements with EPA to carry out certain Superfund actions, including evaluating sites, cleaning them up, and overseeing the cleanups. In addition, most states have established their own hazardous waste programs that can clean up sites independently of the federal Superfund program. State cleanup programs include efforts to enforce state cleanup laws on responsible parties and to encourage them to “voluntarily” clean up contaminated sites. CERCLA requires EPA to develop and maintain a list of hazardous sites, known as the National Priorities List, that the agency considers to present the most serious threats to human health and the environment. These sites represent EPA’s highest priorities for cleanup nationwide. Although EPA may undertake cleanup actions at contaminated sites not on the National Priorities List, the agency’s regulations stipulate that only sites placed on the list are eligible for long-term cleanup (“remedial action”) financed by the agency under the trust fund established by CERCLA. Additional details on EPA’s process for placing sites on the National Priorities List are included in appendix I. The 3,036 sites that were awaiting a National Priorities List decision as of October 1997 represent only a portion of the sites that EPA has evaluated and classified over the history of the Superfund program. According to EPA, as of November 1998, the Superfund program had investigated over 40,000 potential hazardous waste sites and made final decisions about whether or not to include almost 35,000 sites on the National Priorities List. EPA also reported that it has removed waste or taken other interim cleanup actions at over 5,500 sites—most of which are not on the National Priorities List—to address the most urgent risks and stabilize conditions to prevent further releases of contamination. For the more than 1,400 sites EPA has placed on the list, it has completed cleanup studies at most and has completed cleanup construction at 585. States have reported cleaning up thousands of sites under their own programs and authorities. To obtain information on the 3,036 sites that EPA identified as awaiting a National Priorities List decision, we developed and mailed two surveys for each nonfederal site and three surveys for each federal facility. We sent surveys to site assessment officials in EPA’s 10 regional offices, and since state officials might have more knowledge of some of the sites, we also sent surveys to the 50 states, the District of Columbia, Guam, Midway Island, the Northern Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico, and the Navajo Nation (collectively referred to as states in this report). In addition, if a federal agency is responsible for cleaning up sites, we also sent surveys to that agency: We surveyed 14 federal agencies for 157 of the 3,036 sites that are federally owned and/or operated. Because we did not receive responses from some states and incomplete responses from others, we sent follow-up surveys to state officials. In total, we received one or more survey responses for 3,023 (99.5 percent) of the 3,036 sites identified by EPA as awaiting a National Priorities List decision. We discuss our methodology in greater detail in appendix II, and appendix III includes reproductions of our surveys. The responses to our surveys of officials of EPA, other federal agencies, and states indicate that 1,789 of the 3,036 sites classified by EPA’s database as awaiting a National Priorities List decision are potentially eligible for the list. Another 1,234 sites are unlikely to become eligible for the Superfund program for various reasons. First, EPA’s database of potentially contaminated sites, known as the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Information System (CERCLIS), inaccurately lists some sites as awaiting a National Priorities List decision although they are not eligible for listing. EPA regions reported that about 19 percent of the 3,036 sites should not be considered eligible sites because (1) they received preliminary hazard ranking scores below the qualifying level or (2) EPA has already proposed them for the list or decided not to propose them for the list. According to an EPA Superfund program official, the incorrect data entries may have resulted from regional program managers’ misinterpretation of EPA’s guidance on CERCLIS coding. We consider another 22 percent of the sites unlikely to become eligible for the National Priorities List because, according to responding officials, they either do not require any cleanup action (183 sites), have already been cleaned up (182 sites), or are currently undergoing final cleanup (304 sites) under state programs. No information is available on the status of the remaining 13 sites because of missing survey responses (see fig. 1). Final cleanup under way (304 sites) Sites potentially eligible for the NPL (1,789 sites) We performed most of our analysis of site conditions, cleanup activities, and plans for future cleanups for the 1,789 sites remaining after we excluded the categories of sites that are shaded in the figure. We refer to the remaining sites as potentially eligible sites. They include 1,739 nonfederal sites and 50 federal facilities. Responses to our surveys indicate that many of the 1,789 sites that are potentially eligible for the National Priorities List pose risks to human health or the environment. Most of them threaten drinking water sources or groundwater; they are generally located in populated areas; and although many of the sites are fenced to prevent entry, workers, visitors, and trespassers may have direct contact with contaminants at more than half of the sites. The sites are contaminated most often with metals, but other contaminants are also present. Officials of EPA, other federal agencies, and states who responded to our survey characterized the risks presented by about two-thirds of the potentially eligible sites. They said that about 17 percent of the sites currently pose high human health and environmental risks; another 10 percent of the sites potentially pose high future risks. In addition, officials were unsure about the severity of site conditions for a large proportion of potentially eligible sites. A large portion of the potentially eligible sites have contaminated nearby groundwater, drinking water sources, or both. As figures 2 and 3 indicate, about 73 percent of the potentially eligible sites have already contaminated groundwater, and another 22 percent of the sites, approximately, could contaminate groundwater in the future. In addition, about 32 percent of the potentially eligible sites have already contaminated drinking water sources, and about 56 percent more could contaminate drinking water sources in the future. Actual groundwater contamination (1,301 sites) The contamination at many of the potentially eligible sites is also resulting in a number of other adverse conditions. Table 1 shows the percentage of potentially eligible sites that have experienced or contributed to specific conditions. As the table also shows, respondents to our surveys were uncertain whether the conditions were present at a relatively large percentage of the potentially eligible sites. As figure 4 shows, the sites that are potentially eligible for the National Priorities List are contaminated by a variety of pollutants. Metals—primarily heavy metals such as lead, mercury, or cadmium—are the principal contaminants at these sites. These metals can cause brain and kidney damage and birth defects. The second most prominent contaminants at these sites are volatile organic compounds (VOC). VOCs are carbon-based compounds, such as benzene, that easily become vapors or gases and can cause cancer, as well as damage to the blood, immune, and reproductive systems. A large portion of the potentially eligible sites are also contaminated by semivolatile organic compounds (SVOC), which are similar to VOCs and can result in human respiratory illnesses. Additional major contaminants at the sites are pesticides, the most toxic of which can cause acute nervous system effects and skin irritations and may cause reproductive system effects and cancer; polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB), which can cause skin irritations and other related conditions and may contribute to causing cancers, liver damage, and reproductive and developmental effects; dioxins, which are also a suspected human carcinogen; and other unspecified contaminants. The potentially eligible sites are generally located in populated areas: Ninety-six percent are within a half mile of residences or places of regular employment. We asked officials of EPA, other federal agencies, and states to rank the relative risks of potentially eligible sites. The officials responding to our surveys said that they could assess the current risks of 67 percent of the sites and the potential risks of 68 percent of the sites. According to these officials, about 17 percent of the potentially eligible sites currently pose high risks (see fig. 5), and another 10 percent of the sites (for a total of 27 percent) could pose high risks in the future (see fig. 6) if they are not cleaned up. Average current risks (455 sites) Low current risks (443 sites) The 1,789 sites that are potentially eligible for the National Priorities List include (1) 686 sites where some cleanup activities have reportedly taken place or are currently being conducted but the final cleanup remedies are not yet under way and (2) 1,103 sites where officials reported that no substantive cleanup activities beyond initial site assessments or investigations have occurred or no information on cleanup progress is available. Data on the year in which each potentially eligible site was entered into EPA’s records—the “discovery date”—indicate that a significant portion of these sites have been in EPA’s and states’ inventories of known hazardous waste sites for more than a decade. Furthermore, 45 percent of the sites reported to have high current risks and 47 percent of the sites with high potential risks have not had any cleanup activities, or no information on their cleanup progress is available. EPA, other federal agencies, and the states reported conducting some cleanup actions at 38 percent of the potentially eligible sites. Figure 7 shows the number and percentage of potentially eligible sites at which federal and state agencies have undertaken some cleanup activities or conducted other actions such as providing alternative water supplies. (App. IV presents data on the distribution of the sites with and without reported cleanup actions among states and responsible federal agencies.) EPA, other federal agencies, and the states have completed removal actions or interim, partial response actions (not characterized by survey respondents as final cleanup solutions), including changing the water supplies of affected residents, at 576 of the 686 sites with cleanup actions. At the other 110 sites, responding officials told us that some cleanup is under way, but they are not sure if it will be a final response. EPA, other federal agencies, and the states reported conducting no cleanup activities beyond site assessments at the remaining 1,103 potentially eligible sites, or no information on cleanup progress at these sites is available. One hundred and seventy (55 percent) of the 307 sites that are estimated to currently pose high risks have undergone some cleanup activities, while 137 (45 percent) of these sites reportedly have seen no cleanup activities, or no information on cleanup progress is available (see fig. 8). Similarly, 254 (53 percent) of the 476 sites said to potentially pose high risks have undergone some cleanup actions, and 222 (47 percent) have reportedly undergone none, or information is lacking (see fig. 9). See appendix V for additional discussion of the sites at which cleanup actions have been taken. Most of the hazardous waste sites that are potentially eligible for the National Priorities List were “discovered,” that is, entered into EPA’s inventory of sites needing examination, more than a decade ago. As table 2 indicates, 10 percent of the potentially eligible sites were discovered in 1979 or earlier, and 42 percent were discovered before 1985. As shown in figure 10, one-third of the sites that have been known for 10 to 14 years and another third of the sites that have been in the inventory for 15 years or more have undergone some cleanup activities. Conversely, the majority of the sites that have been known for 10 years or more have reportedly made no cleanup progress, or no information on cleanup progress is available. According to the CERCLIS database, many of the potentially eligible sites have not only been in the inventory for a long time but have also been awaiting a National Priorities List decision for several years. The CERCLIS database records the date of the “last action” taken at the inventory sites, including, among other actions, the completion of site inspections or expanded site inspections. These dates generally can be used as an indication of when the sites became potentially eligible for placement on the National Priorities List. The last action recorded for 87 percent of the potentially eligible sites is the completion of a site inspection. Another 12 percent of the sites have completed or are undergoing expanded site inspections. The data show that the last action at half of the potentially eligible sites occurred in 1994 or earlier. The last action date for 24 percent of the sites is 1995, and for 27 percent, 1996 or later. For 4 percent of the sites, the last recorded action took place before 1990. It is uncertain whether most potentially eligible sites will be cleaned up; who will do the cleanup; under what programs these activities will occur; what the extent of responsible parties’ participation will be; and when cleanup actions, if any, are likely to begin. Responding officials did not indicate the final outcome for 53 percent of the 1,789 potentially eligible sites (see fig. 11). They estimated that 536 (30 percent) of the sites will be cleaned up under state programs but usually could not give a date for the start of cleanup or say whether responsible parties would participate. Collectively, they believed that 232 (13 percent) of the potentially eligible sites may be listed on the National Priorities List and cleaned up under the Superfund program, but there are few sites that both federal and state officials agreed would be listed (see fig. 12). Sites likely to be cleaned up under state programs (536) Respondents thought that the largest portion of the potentially eligible sites for which they could predict a cleanup outcome—536 sites, or 30 percent of the 1,789 sites—are likely to be cleaned up under state enforcement or voluntary cleanup programs. However, state officials were able to estimate when they were likely to begin cleaning up only 121 (23 percent) of the 536 sites. They expected to begin cleanup activities at 84 of these sites before the end of 1998 and at 35 sites by the year 2000. State officials also said that parties responsible for the waste at the sites that are expected to be cleaned up under state programs are likely to clean up only 172 (32 percent) of the 536 sites. Such parties are unlikely to participate in cleanups at another 29 (5 percent) of these sites. For the remaining two-thirds of the sites that states reported are likely to be cleaned up under state programs, the extent of responsible parties’ participation is uncertain. Our survey data also show that states are more likely to have cleanup plans for the near future (within 5 years) if responsible parties are available to pay for cleanups. If responsible parties are expected to clean up a site, states are more than twice as likely to have plans to begin work on the cleanup within the next 5 years (10 percent) as for a site at which cleanup by responsible parties is unlikely (4 percent). Furthermore, states are most likely to have plans to complete the cleanup within 5 years if responsible parties are likely to clean up all or almost all of the site. Twenty-one percent of the sites with such parties are expected to be completed by 2003. State officials also provided information about their state’s capabilities for compelling responsible parties to clean up potentially eligible sites or to fund cleanup activities, if necessary. Officials of 33 (75 percent) of the 44 states participating in our telephone survey said that their state’s enforcement capacity (including resources and legal authority) to compel responsible parties to clean up potentially eligible sites is excellent or good. Officials of 5 (11 percent) of the participating states believed that their state’s enforcement capacity is fair, and another 5 (11 percent) said that their state’s enforcement capacity is poor or very poor. The remaining state official was uncertain about the state’s enforcement capability. Furthermore, officials of 11 states (25 percent) told us that their state’s financial capability to clean up potentially eligible sites, if necessary, is excellent or good. Officials of 7 (16 percent) of the states said that their state’s ability to fund cleanups is fair, and 23 (52 percent) said that their state’s ability to fund these cleanups is poor or very poor. The remaining three officials were uncertain about their state’s funding capability. (App. VI presents, by state, officials’ assessments of their state’s ability to fund cleanup activities at potentially eligible sites). EPA officials told us that 43 potentially eligible sites are likely to be cleaned up under other programs such as the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act program. EPA or state officials said that, in their opinion, as many as 232 (13 percent) of the potentially eligible sites may be listed on the National Priorities List in the future. As shown in figure 12, EPA and the states agreed on the possible listing of only a few sites. In general, EPA and state officials believed that those sites with responsible parties who are likely to clean them up are less likely candidates for placement on the National Priorities List. Of the 232 sites cited as possible National Priorities List candidates, 154 (66 percent) have no identified responsible party or no responsible party who officials felt certain is able and willing to conduct cleanup activities. Survey respondents considered such parties likely to clean up all or almost all of only 22 (9 percent) of the 232 sites. No information was provided on the likely extent of responsible parties’ participation in cleaning up the remaining 24 percent of these sites. High-risk sites are more likely to be cited as National Priorities List candidates than others. One hundred twenty-nine (56 percent) of the sites that may be listed on the National Priorities List currently pose high risks, according to survey respondents. Another 45 (19 percent) of the sites pose average risks, and 12 sites (5 percent) pose low risks. Responding officials were unable to estimate the risks of the remaining 46 (20 percent) of these sites. In our telephone surveys, we asked state officials about the types of sites that the states prefer to be placed on the National Priorities List. Officials of 26 (60 percent) of the 44 states that participated in the surveys told us that they are more likely to support listing sites with cleanup costs that are very high compared to those for other types of sites. Although respondents from EPA, other federal agencies, and states jointly believed that as many as 232 of the potentially eligible sites may eventually be placed on the list, none of these sites has yet been proposed for listing. EPA respondents cited several major reasons that the agency has not yet decided whether to propose these sites for the National Priorities List or remove them from further consideration for listing. The most common reasons were that EPA considers the state program to have the lead for cleanup or more data on the current risks of the sites are needed. Other major factors are shown in figure 13. EPA has already made decisions about whether or not to place on the National Priorities List most of the sites that have come into its hazardous waste site inventory. However, decisions to list a large number of sites potentially eligible to enter the Superfund program or to exclude them from further consideration for listing have been deferred, in many cases for over a decade. Our surveys of officials of EPA, other federal agencies, and states indicate that there is a need to decide on how to address these potentially eligible sites. First, about a quarter of the sites may pose high risks to human health and the environment, in the opinion of officials responding to our surveys. Responding officials said that they cannot rank the risks of another third of the sites. Second, some cleanup activities were reported to have occurred at only about half of the sites whose risks were rated high by survey respondents. Third, although all 1,789 potentially eligible sites included in our surveys may require cleanup, officials of EPA, other federal agencies, and states are uncertain about what cleanup actions will be taken at more than half of them and whether EPA or the states should take these actions. Furthermore, some states have concerns about their enforcement and resource capabilities for cleaning up sites. In view of the risks associated with many of the potentially eligible sites and the length of time that EPA or the states have known of them, timely action by EPA and the states is needed to obtain the information required to assess the sites’ risks, set priorities for cleanups, assign responsibility to EPA or the states for arranging the cleanups, and inform the public as to which party is responsible for each site’s cleanup. Also, as part of the process, inaccurate or out-of-date information on sites that are classified in the CERCLIS database as awaiting a National Priorities List decision needs to be corrected. Because of the need for current and accurate information on the risks posed by the 1,789 sites that are potentially eligible for the National Priorities List in order to set cleanup priorities and delineate cleanup responsibilities, we recommend that the Administrator, EPA, in consultation with each applicable state, (1) develop a timetable for EPA or the state to characterize and rank the risks associated with the potentially eligible sites and (2) establish interim cleanup measures that may be appropriate for EPA and the state to take at potentially eligible sites that pose the highest risks while these sites await either placement on the National Priorities List or state action to fully clean them up; in consultation with each applicable state, (1) develop a timetable for determining whether EPA or the state will be responsible for cleaning up individual sites, taking into consideration, among other factors, some states’ limited resources and enforcement authority, and (2) once a determination is made, notify the public as to which party is responsible for cleaning up each site; and correct the errors in the CERCLIS database that incorrectly classify sites as awaiting a National Priorities List decision and prevent the recurrence of such errors so that the database accurately reflects whether sites are awaiting a listing decision. We provided copies of a draft of this report to EPA for its review and comment. EPA provided written comments, which are reproduced in appendix VII. Overall, EPA agreed with the basic findings and recommendations of the report and stated that it believes that the report will be useful to the Congress, the agency, states, and others interested in the future of the Superfund program. EPA also said that it has made National Priorities List decisions for many of the sites in its hazardous waste site inventory and made significant progress toward cleaning up listed sites. We have added this information to the report. EPA also provided technical and clarifying comments that we have incorporated in the report as appropriate. We attempted to obtain information on all 3,036 sites that EPA has identified as awaiting a National Priorities List decision, including 157 federal sites and 2,879 nonfederal sites. To obtain this information, we developed surveys that we sent to officials in EPA’s 10 regional offices, the 50 states, the District of Columbia, Guam, Midway Island, the Northern Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico, the Navajo Nation, and 14 other federal agencies with responsibility for sites that are potentially eligible for the National Priorities List and awaiting EPA’s decision on their disposition. These agencies include the departments of Agriculture, the Air Force, the Army, Defense, Energy, the Interior, the Navy, and Transportation; the Bureau of Land Management; the General Services Administration; the National Aeronautics and Space Administration; the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers; the U.S. Coast Guard; and the U.S. Forest Service. We also conducted a telephone survey with officials in 44 states to determine general information on their hazardous waste management programs and sites within their jurisdiction. (App. II discusses our scope and methodology in greater detail.) We conducted our review between May 1997 and November 1998 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. As arranged with your office, unless you announce its contents earlier, we plan no further distribution of this report until 30 days after the date of this letter. At that time, we will send copies of this report to the appropriate congressional committees; the Administrator, EPA; and the Director, Office of Management and Budget. We will also make copies available to others upon request. Please call me at (202) 512-6111 if you or your staff have any questions. Major contributors to this report are listed in appendix VIII. The Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) regulations outline a formal process for assessing hazardous waste sites and placing them on the National Priorities List (NPL). The process begins when EPA receives a report of a potentially hazardous waste site from a state government, a private citizen, or a responsible federal agency. EPA enters a potentially contaminated site into a database known as the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Information System (CERCLIS). EPA or the state in which the potentially contaminated site is located then conducts a preliminary assessment to decide whether the site poses a potential threat to human health and the environment. (According to EPA, about half of the assessments are conducted by states under funding from EPA.) If the preliminary assessment shows that contamination may exist, EPA or a state under an agreement with the agency may conduct a site inspection, a more detailed examination of possible contamination, and in some cases a follow-on examination called an expanded site inspection. Using information from the preliminary assessment and site inspection, EPA applies its Hazard Ranking System to evaluate the site’s potential threat to the public health and the environment. The system assigns each site a score ranging from 0 to 100 for use as a screening tool to determine whether the site should be considered for further action under Superfund. A site with a score of 28.5 or higher is considered for placement on the NPL. Once EPA determines that an eligible site warrants listing, the agency first proposes that the site be placed on the NPL and then, after receiving public comments, either lists it or removes it from further consideration. EPA may choose not to list a site if a state prefers to deal with it under its own cleanup program. Generally, EPA’s policy is to not list sites on the NPL unless the governor of the state in which the site is located concurs with its listing. Our objectives in this review were to (1) determine the number of sites awaiting an NPL decision that remain potentially eligible for the list; (2) describe the characteristics of these sites, including their health and environmental risks; (3) determine the status of any actions to clean up these sites; and (4) collect the opinions of EPA and other federal and state officials on the likely final disposition of these sites, including the number of sites that are likely to be added to the Superfund program. EPA’s CERCLIS database indicates that as of October 8, 1997, 3,036 sites were potentially eligible for the NPL on the basis of a combination of criteria. These criteria include a preliminary hazardous ranking system score of 28.5 or above, the completion of a site inspection or the initiation of an expanded site inspection, and a status that neither eliminates the site from consideration for the NPL nor includes a proposal to list it. Because our objectives require data for each site, we did not sample the sites but included all 3,036 in our survey. To obtain information on all 3,036 sites that EPA identified as awaiting an NPL decision, we developed three mail surveys. These surveys appear in appendix III. We sent the first of the surveys to officials in EPA’s 10 regional offices responsible for evaluating the sites and making decisions about listing. Because state officials may have closer contact with some of the sites, we sent the second survey to officials in the 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, Midway Island, and the Navajo Nation (collectively referred to as states in this report). In addition, we sent a third survey to federal agencies that are responsible for cleaning up the 157 federally owned and/or operated sites that were classified as awaiting an NPL decision. We sent surveys on the 157 sites to 14 federal agencies, including the departments of Agriculture, the Air Force, the Army, Defense, Energy, the Interior, the Navy, and Transportation; the Bureau of Land Management; the General Services Administration; the National Aeronautics and Space Administration; the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers; the U.S. Coast Guard; and the U.S. Forest Service. The three surveys asked respondents for detailed information on the conditions at each site, including the site’s current and potential risks, and their opinions on the involvement of potentially responsible parties and the likely outcome for the site’s cleanup, including any potential for NPL listing. We mailed our three surveys in November and December 1997 and received the final survey responses in September 1998. We received one or more survey responses for 3,023 (99.6 percent) of the 3,036 sites identified by EPA as awaiting an NPL decision. On the basis of these responses, we identified 1,234 sites that are no longer eligible for the NPL or no longer awaiting an NPL decision. Because we received no survey responses for 13 sites, we could not determine whether they are still eligible for the NPL; therefore, we excluded these sites from our analyses. The remaining 1,789 sites are analyzed in this report as potentially eligible sites. Of these sites, 1,739 were nonfederal sites, and 50 were federally owned and/or operated sites. Through our surveys, we obtained information from both EPA and the states on 1,319 (76 percent) of the 1,739 potentially eligible nonfederal sites. This information includes 1,326 state responses (76 percent) and 1,732 responses from EPA (99.6 percent). Similarly, we obtained information from at least two of the three possible respondents—EPA, other federal agencies, and states—for 45 (90 percent) of the 50 potentially eligible federal sites. Responsible federal agencies provided information for 39 (78 percent) of the 50 potentially eligible federal sites, states provided responses for 26 (52 percent) of the federal sites, and EPA regions provided responses for 49 (98 percent) of the federal sites. Because 19 states—including California, Massachusetts, and New York, which account for 19 percent of the 3,036 sites—did not fully respond to our initial survey mailing, in July 1998 we sent a second survey to these states. In order to minimize the effort required for states to complete this follow-up survey, we eliminated sites that EPA and other federal agencies had identified as no longer eligible for the NPL. In addition, the follow-up survey included as a starting point the information on each site that EPA regions had provided in their responses. We asked state officials to confirm or correct the information provided to us by EPA regions. In the follow-up survey, we also repeated the original questions asked of the states but not of EPA regions. The original state survey was included as a reference source. This follow-up effort resulted in our receiving an additional 85 completed surveys from some states. However, despite numerous contacts, we received no survey responses from California, Massachusetts, Nebraska, and the District of Columbia. Rather than responding to our survey, California officials suggested that we obtain their responses to a brief 1-page survey on NPL-eligible sites conducted by the Association of State and Territorial Solid Waste Management Officials. Similarly, Massachusetts officials provided us copies of their responses to the Association’s survey. However, because of differences in the format, specificity of answers, comparability of answers, and topics covered, we could not incorporate the results of that survey into our analyses. In addition, New York State officials agreed to respond to only three survey questions for the sites in the state that EPA classified as awaiting an NPL decision. The three questions asked for information about whether sites would be listed on the NPL and what state cleanup activities had occurred at the sites. The responses to these questions were incorporated into our analyses. While our overall survey response rate was high, our data for some states are incomplete. We did not receive fully completed state surveys for 491 of the 1,789 potentially eligible sites. Nearly three-quarters of these sites are located in California (125 sites) and Massachusetts (190 sites). In addition, we received only partial information from New York for 54 of its 56 potentially eligible sites. Table II.1 shows the 16 states that either did not respond to our survey or responded only in part, and the number and percentage of potentially eligible sites in each state for which we did not receive fully completed surveys. EPA regions I and V notified us that because of time and resource constraints, they had taken a generic approach to answering certain survey questions: That is, they answered certain questions in a standardized manner for all sites in the region rather than on a site-specific basis. Questions addressed in this manner included, among others, those relating to the likely placement of sites on the NPL and the risks posed by the sites. For example, for most sites, Region I answered our questions about the degree of human health or environmental risks posed by each site by responding that it is “too early to tell/more information is needed to answer” because, according to Region I officials, “risk assessments are not conducted for most CERCLIS sites, and thus the current risks posed by these sites are difficult to determine.” EPA Region II responded to key survey questions in a similar manner. Consequently, because neither EPA regions I, II, and V nor three states in those regions —Massachusetts (190 sites), New Jersey (66 sites), and New York (54 sites)—provided complete survey information, we could not characterize the conditions at these sites with the same degree of accuracy as for other sites. For example, these three states account for 54 percent of the sites for which we could not obtain an official’s estimate of the risks to human health and the environment. We conducted pretests of our surveys with officials in six states, at two federal agencies, and in five EPA regional offices. Each pretest consisted of a visit with an official by GAO staff. We attempted to vary the types of sites for which we conducted pretests and the familiarity of the respondents with the sites. In some cases, the respondent used only site records to answer our survey. In other cases, the respondent knew most of the answers without consulting records. The pretest attempted to simulate the actual survey experience by asking the official to fill out the survey while GAO staff observed and took notes. Then the official was interviewed about the survey items to ensure that (1) the questions were readable and clear, (2) terms were precise, (3) the survey was not a burden that would result in a lack of cooperation, and (4) the survey appeared independent and unbiased. We made appropriate changes to the final survey on the basis of our pretesting. In addition to our pretesting, we obtained views on our surveys from managers in EPA’s Office of Emergency and Remedial Response in Washington, D.C., which oversees the Superfund program. We incorporated comments from these reviews as appropriate. In analyzing survey responses, we reviewed comments written by respondents on the surveys, including marginal comments, comments at the end of the survey, and comments when the respondents provided explanations after checking “other.” If a respondent’s comment explaining the selection of “other” could reasonably be interpreted as another of the answer choices provided for the question, we revised the response as appropriate. In some cases, respondents’ comments indicated a misunderstanding of our questions or answer choices. In these cases, where possible, we revised the response to reflect the appropriate answer. In other cases, respondents checked more than one answer; we then selected, where possible, what we considered to be the appropriate answer, on the basis of other responses in the survey or our own judgment. The procedures used in this editing process were documented in an internal 17-page document provided to all of the GAO reviewers of the survey responses. At least two reviewers analyzed each survey response, and the reviewers coordinated their efforts to ensure that all reviewers followed the established procedures. Both the original answers and the answers revised by reviewers were recorded. In our surveys of officials of EPA regions, states, and federal agencies, some of the questions we asked about particular sites were identical. We combined the responses to these questions where possible in this report. If opinions differed, we used a set of criteria to combine answers. Namely, we chose the answer that seemed to reflect the most knowledge of the site. For site conditions, we assumed that any affirmative answer was the more knowledgeable. For example, if one respondent said that a site has groundwater contamination and the other respondent was unable to comment on that site’s contamination, we recorded the site as having groundwater contamination. We also sought to avoid understatement of the risks posed by a site. Therefore, if respondents disagreed on the level of a site’s risks, we selected the response indicating the more severe threat. For example, sites scored by any respondent as high-risk were recorded as high-risk sites. Furthermore, if a respondent indicated in any survey response that a site might be included on the NPL, we recorded the site as a possible candidate for the NPL. Finally, when opinions about the most likely outcome for a site were in conflict—for example, if the state thought that EPA would clean up a site but EPA thought the state would conduct the cleanup—we recorded the most likely outcome as unknown. In addition to our mail surveys, we also conducted a telephone survey with officials in 44 states to determine general information on their hazardous waste management programs and sites within their states. State officials in Idaho, New York, Missouri, Utah, Virginia, and Wyoming declined to participate in our telephone survey. We conducted our review between May 1997 and November 1998 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. The 1,789 sites that are potentially eligible for the NPL include 1,739 nonfederal sites and 50 federal facilities. Among the 1,789 sites, there are (1) 686 sites at which some cleanup activities have taken place or are currently being conducted, but the final cleanup remedy is not yet under way, and (2) 1,103 sites for which no substantive cleanup activities have been reported or no information on cleanup progress is available. The 1,789 sites that are potentially eligible for placement on the NPL are located in 48 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the Northern Mariana Islands and under the jurisdiction of the Navajo Nation (hereinafter referred to as states). Table IV.1 shows, for each state, the number of (1) sites classified in EPA’s inventory as awaiting an NPL decision as of October 8, 1997, (2) sites that our surveys indicate are unlikely to become eligible for the NPL, (3) potentially eligible sites at which some cleanup activities have been conducted, (4) potentially eligible sites at which there has been no reported cleanup progress or for which no information on cleanup progress is available, and (5) sites for which we received no surveys. Number of sites for which no surveys were received (continued) Number of sites for which no surveys were received (continued) California, the District of Columbia, Massachusetts, and Nebraska did not respond to our surveys. For these states, the data in table IV.1 are based on EPA’s survey responses alone and, for that reason, may be less reliable than for states having responses from both EPA and states. New York provided responses to only a few questions in our survey. Under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA), federal agencies are responsible, under EPA’s supervision, for evaluating and cleaning up properties under their jurisdiction. As required by CERCLA, EPA has established a Federal Agency Hazardous Waste Compliance Docket that lists federal facilities awaiting evaluation for possible cleanup. Once a federal facility is listed on the docket, the responsible agency then conducts a preliminary assessment to gather data on the facility and performs a site inspection, which may involve taking and analyzing samples, to learn more about potential contamination there. Ten federal agencies other than EPA have primary responsibility for managing the 50 federal facilities that are potentially eligible for the NPL. Table IV.2 presents for each agency the number of (1) sites classified in EPA’s inventory as awaiting an NPL decision as of October 8, 1997, (2) sites that our surveys indicate are unlikely to become eligible for the NPL, (3) potentially eligible sites at which some cleanup activities have been conducted, and (4) potentially eligible sites at which there has been no reported cleanup progress or for which no information on cleanup progress is available. We asked officials of EPA, other federal agencies, and states about the cleanup actions that have been conducted at the potentially eligible sites. These activities include interim measures to mitigate the contamination, such as removing waste or taking action to protect people against contaminated drinking water sources. These actions were not considered by the officials to be final cleanup remedies. As figure V.1 shows, of the total 1,789 potentially eligible sites, 13 percent exhibit one or more of the conditions associated with contaminated drinking water sources. The majority of these sites have undergone some cleanup activities. Survey data indicate that some cleanup activities have occurred at 77 percent of the sites for which nearby residents are advised not to use wells and at 72 percent of the sites for which residents are advised to use bottled water. Figure V.1 includes, among other factors, the five most prevalent adverse conditions identified by officials responding to our surveys. As this figure indicates, the majority of the sites with these conditions reportedly have made no cleanup progress, or no information on cleanup progress is available. No known cleanup actions have been taken at (1) 56 percent of the sites at which workers or visitors may come into direct contact with contaminants; (2) 57 percent of the sites at which trespassers may come into direct contact with contaminants; (3) 52 percent of the sites with fences, barriers, and/or signs to prevent entry into contaminated areas; (4) 61 percent of the sites associated with fish that may be unsafe to eat; and (5) 48 percent of the sites about which nearby residents have expressed some health concerns. During our telephone survey of officials in 44 states to obtain general information on their hazardous waste management programs, officials gave their opinions about their state’s capability to fund cleanup activities if responsible parties were not willing or able to pay for these actions. Officials of about a quarter of the responding states told us that their state’s financial capability to clean up potentially eligible sites, if necessary, is excellent or good, and more than half said that their state’s ability to fund these cleanups is poor or very poor. Table VI.1 presents, by state, the responding officials’ assessments of each state’s ability to fund cleanup activities at potentially eligible sites.

GAO noted that: (1) on the basis of surveys of EPA regions, other federal agencies, and states, GAO has determined that 1,789 of the 3,036 sites that EPA's database classified as awaiting a NPL decision in October 1997 are still potentially eligible for placement on the list; (2) GAO considered the 1,234 other sites as unlikely to become eligible for various reasons; (3) the other sites do not require cleanup in the view of the responding officials, have already been cleaned up, or have final cleanup activities under way; (4) officials of EPA, other federal agencies, and states said that many of the potentially eligible sites present risks to human health and the environment; (5) the potentially eligible sites are generally located in populated areas; (6) officials of EPA, other federal agencies, and states said that about 17 percent of the potentially eligible sites currently pose high human health and environmental risks and that another 10 percent could also pose high risks in the future if they are not cleaned up; (7) however, these officials were unsure about the severity of risks for a large proportion of the sites; (8) responding officials said that some cleanup actions have taken place at 686 of the potentially eligible sites; (9) no cleanup activities beyond initial site assessments or investigations have been conducted, or no information is available on any such actions, at the other 1,103 potentially eligible sites; (10) many of the potentially eligible sites have been in states' and EPA's inventories of hazardous sites for extended periods; (11) 73 percent have been in EPA's inventory for more than a decade; (12) no cleanup progress was reported at the majority of the sites that have been known for 10 years or more; (13) responding officials did not indicate whether or how more than half of the potentially eligible sites would be cleaned up; (14) collectively, EPA and state officials believed that 232 of the potentially eligible sites might be placed on the NPL in the future; (15) however, EPA and the states agreed on the listing prospects of only a small number of specific sites; (16) officials estimated that almost one third of the potentially eligible sites are likely to be cleaned up under state programs but usually could not give a date for the start of cleanup activities; (17) officials of about 20 percent of the states said that their state's enforcement capacity to compel responsible parties to clean up potentially eligible sites is fair to very poor; and (18) officials of about half of the states told GAO that their state's financial capability to clean up potentially eligible sites is poor or very poor.",govreport
"OPM’s mission is to ensure that the federal government has an effective civilian workforce. In this regard, one of the agency’s major human resources tasks is to manage and administer the retirement program for federal employees. According to the agency, the program serves federal employees by providing (1) retirement compensation and (2) tools and options for retirement planning. OPM’s Center for Retirement and Insurance Services administers the two defined benefit retirement plans that provide retirement, disability, and survivor benefits to federal employees. The first plan, the Civil Service Retirement System (CSRS), provides retirement benefits for most federal employees hired before 1984. The second plan, the Federal Employees Retirement System (FERS), covers most employees hired in or after 1984 and provides benefits that include Social Security and a defined contribution system. According to OPM, there are approximately 2.9 million active federal employees and nearly 2.5 million retired federal employees. The agency’s March 2008 analysis of federal employment retirement data estimates that nearly 1 million active federal employees will be eligible to retire and almost 600,000 will most likely retire by 2016. Figure 1 summarizes the estimated number of employees eligible and likely to retire. OPM and employing agencies’ human resources and payroll offices are responsible for processing federal employees’ retirement applications. The process begins when an employee submits a paper retirement application to his or her employer’s human resources office and is completed when the individual begins receiving regular monthly benefit payments (as illustrated in fig. 2). Once an employee submits an application, the employing agency’s human resources office provides retirement counseling services to the employee and augments the retirement application with additional paperwork, such as a separation form that finalizes the date the employee will retire. Then the agency provides the retirement package to the employee’s payroll office. After the employee separates for retirement, the payroll office is responsible for reviewing the documents for correct signatures and information, making sure that all required forms have been submitted, and adding any additional paperwork that will be necessary for processing the retirement package. Once the payroll office has finalized the paperwork, the retirement package is mailed to OPM to continue the retirement process. Payroll offices are expected to submit the package to OPM within 30 days of the retiree’s separation date. Upon receipt of the retirement package, OPM calculates an interim payment based on information provided by the employing agency. The interim payments are partial payments that typically provide retirees with 80 percent of the total monthly benefit they will eventually receive. OPM then starts the process of analyzing the retirement application and associated paperwork to determine the total monthly benefit amount to which the retiree is entitled. This process includes collecting additional information from the employing agency’s human resources and payroll offices or from the retiree to ensure that all necessary data are available before calculating benefits. After OPM completes its review and authorizes payment, the retiree begins receiving 100 percent of the monthly retirement benefit payments. OPM then stores the paper retirement folder at the Retirement Operations Center in Boyers, Pennsylvania. According to the agency’s 2008 performance report, the average processing time from the date OPM receives the initial application to the time the retiree receives a full payment is 42 days. According to the Deputy Associate Director for the Center of Retirement and Insurance Services, about 200 employees are directly involved in processing the approximately 100,000 retirement applications OPM receives annually. This processing includes functions such as determining retirement eligibility, inputting data into benefit calculators, and providing customer service. The agency uses over 500 different procedures, laws, and regulations, which are documented on the agency’s internal Web site, to process retirement applications. For example, the site contains memorandums that outline new procedures for handling special retirement applications, such as those for disability or court orders. Further, OPM’s retirement processing involves the use of over 80 information systems that have approximately 400 interfaces with other internal and external systems. For instance, 26 internal systems interface with the Department of the Treasury to provide, among other things, information regarding the total amount of benefit payments to which an employee is entitled. OPM has stated that the federal employee retirement process currently does not provide prompt and complete benefit payments upon retirement, and that customer service expectations for more timely payments are increasing. The agency also reports that a greater workload is expected due to an anticipated increase in the number of retirement applications over the next decade, yet current retirement processing operations are at full capacity. Further, the agency has identified several factors that limit its ability to process retirement benefits in an efficient and timely manner. Specifically, it noted that current processes are paper-based and manually intensive, resulting in a higher number of errors and delays in providing benefit payments; the high costs, limited capabilities, and other problems with the existing information systems and processes pose increasing risks to the accuracy of benefit payments; current manual capabilities restrict customer service; federal employees have limited access to their retirement records, making planning for retirement difficult; and attracting qualified personnel to operate and maintain the antiquated retirement systems, which have about 3 million lines of custom programming, is challenging. In the late 1980s, OPM recognized the need to automate and modernize its retirement processing and began retirement modernization initiatives that have continuously called for automating its antiquated paper-based processes. The agency’s previously established program management plans included the objectives of having timely and accurate retirement benefit payments and more efficient and flexible processes. For example, the agency’s plans call for processing retirement applications and providing retirees 100 percent of their monthly benefit payments the day it is due versus providing interim monthly payments. Its initial modernization vision called for providing prompt and complete benefit payments by developing an integrated system and automated processes. However, the agency has faced significant and long-standing challenges in doing so. In early 1987, OPM began a program called the FERS Automated Processing System (FAPS). However, after 8 years of planning, the agency decided it needed to reevaluate the program, and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) requested that an independent board conduct a review to identify critical issues impeding progress and recommend ways to address the issues. The review identified various management weaknesses, including the lack of an established strategic plan, cost estimation methodologies, and baseline; improperly defined and ineffectively managed requirements; and no clear accountability for decision making and oversight. Accordingly, the board suggested areas for improvement and recommended terminating the program if immediate action was not taken. In mid-1996, OPM terminated the program. In 1997, OPM began planning a second modernization initiative, called the Retirement Systems Modernization (RSM) program. The agency originally intended to structure the program as an acquisition of commercially available hardware and software that would be modified in-house to meet its needs. From 1997 to 2001, OPM developed plans and analyses and began developing business and security requirements for the program. However, in June 2001, it decided to change the direction of the retirement modernization initiative. In late 2001, retaining the name RSM, the agency embarked upon its third initiative to modernize the retirement process and examined the possibility of privately sourced technologies and tools. To this end, OPM issued a request for information to obtain private sourcing options and determined that contracting was a viable alternative that would be cost efficient, less risky, and more likely to be completed on time and on budget. In 2006, the agency awarded three contracts for: (1) a commercially available, defined benefits technology solution (DBTS) to automate retirement processing; (2) services to convert paper records to electronic files; and (3) consulting services to support the redesign of its retirement operations. The contract for DBTS was awarded to Hewitt Associates, and the additional contracts to support the technology were awarded to Accenture Ltd. and Northrop Grumman Corporation, as reflected in table 1. OPM produced a December 2007 program management plan that, among other things, described capabilities the agency expected to implement as outcomes of retirement modernization. Among these capabilities, the agency expected to implement retirement benefit modeling and planning tools for active federal employees, a standardized retirement benefit calculation system, and a consolidated system to support all aspects of retirement processing. In February 2008, OPM renamed the program RetireEZ and deployed a limited initial version of DBTS. As the foundation of the modernization initiative, DBTS was to be a comprehensive technology solution that would provide capabilities to substantially automate retirement processing. This technology was to be provided by the contractor for a period of 10 years and was intended to provide, among other things, an integrated database with calculation functionality for retirement processing. In addition to calculating retirement benefit amounts, DBTS was intended to provide active and retired federal employees with self- service, Internet-based tools for accessing accounts, updating retirement records, submitting transactions, monitoring the status of claims, and forecasting retirement income. The technology was also expected to enhance customer service by providing OPM and agency personnel with the capability to access retirement information online. Further, the technology was expected to be integrated with OPM and federal agency electronic retirement records and processes. When fully implemented, the modernized program was expected to serve OPM retirement processing personnel, federal agency human resources and payroll offices, active federal employees, retirees, and the beneficiaries of retirees. According to the agency, in late February 2008, the DBTS was deployed with limited functionality to 26,000 federal employees serviced by the General Services Administration’s (GSA) payroll offices. In April 2008, OPM reported that 13 of the 37 retirement applications received from GSA’s payroll office had been processed through DBTS with manual intervention and provided the retirees 100 percent of their monthly benefits within 30 days from their retirement date. However, a month later, the agency determined that DBTS had not worked as expected and suspended system operation. In October 2008, after 5 months of attempting to address system quality issues, the agency terminated the contract. In November 2008, OPM began restructuring the program and reported that its efforts to modernize retirement processing would continue. Figure 3 illustrates the timeline of retirement modernization initiatives from 1987 to the present. Various entities within OPM are responsible for managing RetireEZ. Specifically, the management is composed of committees, a program office, and operational support, as reflected in table 2. Since 2005, we have conducted several studies of OPM’s retirement modernization noting weaknesses in its management of the initiative. In February of that year, we reported that the agency lacked processes for retirement modernization acquisition activities, such as determining requirements, developing acquisition strategies, and implementing a risk program. Further, the agency had not established effective security management, change management, and program executive oversight. We recommended that the Director of OPM ensure that the retirement modernization program office expeditiously establish processes for effective oversight of the retirement modernization in the areas of system acquisition management, information security, organizational change management, and information technology (IT) investment management. In response, between 2005 and 2007, the agency initiated steps toward establishing management processes for retirement modernization and demonstrated the completion of activities with respect to each of our nine recommendations. However, in January 2008, we reported that the agency still needed to improve its management of the program to ensure a successful outcome for its modernization efforts. Specifically, we reported that initial test results had not provided assurance that DBTS would perform as intended, the testing schedule increased the risk that the agency would not have sufficient resources or time to ensure that all system components were tested before deployment, and trends in identifying and resolving system defects had indicated a growing backlog of problems to be resolved prior to deployment. Further, we reported that although the agency had established a risk management process, it had not reliably estimated the program costs, and its progress reporting was questionable because it did not reflect the actual state of the program. We recommended that the Director of OPM address these deficiencies by conducting effective system tests and resolving urgent and high priority system defects prior to system deployment, in addition to improving program cost estimation and progress reporting. In response to our report, OPM stated that it concurred with our recommendations and was taking steps to address them. However, in March 2008, we determined that the agency was moving forward with system deployment and had not yet implemented its planned actions. OPM subsequently affirmed its agreement with our recommendations in April 2008 and reported that it had implemented or was in the process of implementing each recommendation. As of March 2009, however, these recommendations still had not been fully addressed. OPM remains far from fully implementing the retirement modernization capabilities described when it documented its plans for RetireEZ in 2007. The agency only partially implemented two of eight capabilities that it identified to modernize retirement processing. The remaining six capabilities, which were to be delivered through the DBTS contract, have not been implemented, and OPM’s plans to continue implementing them are uncertain. While the agency has taken steps to restructure the RetireEZ program without the DBTS contract, it has not developed a plan to guide its future modernization efforts. OPM’s retirement modernization plans from 2007 described eight capabilities that were to be implemented to achieve modernized processes and systems. As of late March 2009, the agency had partially implemented two of these capabilities while the remaining six had not been implemented (see table 3). Specifically, it had achieved partial implementation of an integrated database of retirement information that was intended to be accessible to OPM and agency retirement processing personnel. In this regard, the agency implemented a new database, populated with images of retirement information, which is accessible to OPM retirement processing personnel online. This database contains over 8 million files which, according to agency officials, represent approximately 80 to 90 percent of the available retirement information for all active federal employees. However, the capability for the information in the database to be integrated with OPM’s legacy retirement processing systems and to be accessible to other agency retirement processing personnel has not yet been implemented. OPM has also partially implemented enhanced customer service capabilities. Specifically, the agency acquired a new telephone infrastructure (i.e., additional lines) and hired additional customer service representatives to reduce wait times and abandonment rates. However, the agency has not yet developed the capabilities for OPM retirement processing personnel to provide enhanced customer support to active and retired federal employees through online account access and management. Moreover, six other capabilities have not been implemented—and plans to implement them are uncertain—because they were to be delivered through the now-terminated DBTS contract, which had been expected to provide a single system that would automate the processing of retirement applications, calculations, and benefit payments. Among the capabilities not implemented was one for other agencies’ automated submissions of retirement information to OPM that could be used to process retirement applications. While OPM began developing this capability by establishing interfaces with other agencies as part of its effort to implement DBTS, it discontinued the use of the interfaces for processing retirement applications when the DBTS contract was terminated. Thus, federal agencies that submit retirement information to OPM continue to provide paper packages and information when employees are ready to retire. Further, OPM has not implemented a planned capability for active and retired federal employees to access online retirement information through self-service tools. While the agency provided demonstrations of DBTS in April 2008 that showed the ability for employees to access information online, including applying for retirement and modeling future retirement benefits, this capability was to be provided by DBTS, and thus, no longer exists. The contractor had also been expected to deliver a consolidated system to support all aspects of retirement processing and an electronic case management system to support retirement processing. In the absence of these capabilities, the agency continues to manage cases through paper tracking and stand-alone systems. Additionally, OPM and federal agencies continue to rely on nonstandardized systems to determine and calculate retirement benefits, and federal retirees currently have only limited online, self-service tools. Program management principles and best practices emphasize the importance of using a program management plan that, among other things, establishes a complete description that ties together all program activities. An effective plan includes a description of the program’s scope, implementation strategy, lines of responsibility and authority, management processes, and a schedule. Such a plan incorporates all the critical areas of system development and is to be used as a means of determining what needs to be done, by whom, and when. Furthermore, establishing results-oriented (i.e., objective, quantifiable, and measurable) goals and measures, that can be included in a plan, provides stakeholders with the information they need to effectively oversee and manage programs. A plan for the future of the RetireEZ program has not been completed. In November 2008, OPM began restructuring the program and reported it was continuing toward retirement modernization without the DBTS contract. The restructuring efforts have resulted in a wide variety of documentation, including multiple descriptions of the program in formal agency reports, budget documentation, agency briefing slides, and related documents. For example, OPM’s November Fiscal Year 2008 Agency Financial Report described what the RetireEZ program is expected to achieve (e.g., provide retirement modeling tools for federal employees) once implemented. The agency’s Annual Performance Report, dated January 2009, outlined that the new vision for the restructured program is “to support benefit planning and management throughout a participant’s lifecycle through an enhanced federal retirement program.” The agency also presented information to OMB that identified eight fiscal year 2009 program initiatives, as listed in table 4. The agency has developed a variety of informal program documents and briefing slides that describe retirement modernization activities. For instance, one document prepared by the program office describes a five- phased approach that is intended to replace its previous DBTS-reliant strategy. The approach includes the following activities: (1) collecting electronic retirement information, (2) automating the retirement application process, (3) integrating retirement information, (4) developing retirement calculation technologies and tools, and (5) improving post- retirement processes through a technology solution. In addition, briefing slides also prepared by the program office outline a schedule for efforts to identify new technologies to support retirement modernization by drafting a request for information, which OPM expects to issue in late April 2009. Regardless, OPM’s various reports and documents describing its planned retirement modernization activities do not provide a complete plan for its restructured program. Specifically, although agency documents describe program implementation activities, they do not include a definition of the program, its scope, lines of responsibility and authority, management processes, and schedule. Also, the modernization program documentation does not describe results-oriented (i.e., objective, quantifiable, and measurable) performance goals and measures. According to the RetireEZ program manager, the agency is developing plans, but they will not be ready for release until the new OPM director has approved them, which is expected to occur in April 2009. Until the agency completes and uses a plan that includes all of the above elements to guide its efforts, it will not be properly positioned to obtain agreement with relevant stakeholders (e.g., Congress, OMB, federal agencies, and OPM senior executives) for its restructured retirement modernization initiative. Further, the agency will also not have a key mechanism that it needs to help ensure successful implementation of future modernization efforts. OPM has significant management weaknesses in five areas that are important to the success of its retirement modernization program: cost estimating, EVM, requirements management, testing, and program oversight. For example, the agency has not performed key steps, including the development of a cost estimating plan or completion of a work breakdown structure, both of which are necessary to develop a reliable program cost estimate. Also, OPM has not established and validated a performance measurement baseline, which is essential for reliable EVM. Further, although OPM is revising its previously developed system requirements, it has not established processes and plans to guide this work. Nor has the agency addressed test activities, even though developing processes and planning test activities early in the life cycle are recognized best practices for effective testing. Furthermore, although OPM’s Executive Steering Committee and Investment Review Board have recently become more active regarding RetireEZ, these bodies did not exercise effective oversight in the past, which has allowed the aforementioned management weaknesses to persist. Notably, OPM has not established guidance regarding how these entities are to engage with the program when corrective actions are needed. Until OPM addresses these weaknesses, many of which we and others made recommendations to correct, the agency’s retirement modernization initiative remains at risk of failure. The establishment of a reliable cost estimate is a necessary element for informed investment decision making, realistic budget formulation, and meaningful progress measurement. A cost estimate is the summation of individual program cost elements that have been developed by using established methods and validated data to estimate future costs. According to federal policy, programs must maintain current and well- documented estimates of program costs, and these estimates must span the full expected life of the program. Our Cost Estimating and Assessment Guide includes best practices that agencies can use for developing and managing program cost estimates that are comprehensive, well-documented, accurate, and credible, and provide management with a sound basis for establishing a baseline to measure program performance and formulate budgets. This guide identifies a cost estimating process that includes initial steps such as defining the estimate’s purpose (i.e., its intended use, scope, and level of detail); developing the estimating plan (i.e., the estimating approach, team, and timeline); defining the program (e.g., technical baseline description); and determining the estimating structure (e.g., work breakdown structure). According to best practices, these initial steps in the cost estimating process are of the utmost importance, and should be fully completed in order for the estimate to be considered valid and reliable. OPM officials stated that they intend to complete a modernization program cost estimate by July 2009. However, the agency has not yet fully completed initial steps for developing the new estimate. Specifically, the agency has not yet fully defined the estimate’s purpose, developed the estimating plan, defined program characteristics in a technical baseline description, or determined the estimating structure. With respect to the estimate’s purpose, agency officials stated that the estimate will inform the budget justification of RetireEZ for fiscal year 2011 and beyond. However, the agency has not clearly defined the scope or level of detail of the estimate. Regarding the estimating plan, agency officials stated that they have created a timeline to complete the estimate by July 2009. However, the agency has not documented an estimating plan that includes the approach and resources required to complete the estimate in the time period identified. With respect to the technical baseline description, agency officials stated that they are in the advanced stages of developing a request for information and a concept of operations that will serve as the basis for a technical baseline description. These documents are expected to be reviewed for approval in April 2009. Regarding the estimating structure, the agency has developed a work breakdown structure that identifies elements of the program to be estimated. However, the agency has not yet developed a work breakdown structure dictionary that clearly defines each element. Weaknesses in the reliability of OPM’s retirement modernization cost estimate have been long-standing. We first reported on the agency’s lack of a reliable cost estimate in January 2008 when we noted that critical activities, including documentation of a technical baseline description, had not been performed, and we recommended that the agency revise the estimate. Although OPM agreed to produce a reliable program cost estimate, the agency has not yet done so. Until OPM fully completes each of the steps, the agency increases the risk that it will produce an unreliable estimate and will not have a sound basis for measuring program performance and formulating retirement modernization program budgets. OMB and OPM policies require major IT programs to use EVM to measure and report program progress. EVM is a tool for measuring program progress by comparing the value of work accomplished with the amount of work expected to be accomplished. Such a comparison permits actual performance to be evaluated, based on variances from the planned cost and schedule, and future performance to be forecasted. Identification of significant variances and analysis of their causes helps program managers determine the need for corrective actions. Before EVM analysis can be reliably performed, developing a credible cost estimate is necessary. In addition to developing a cost estimate, an integrated baseline review must be conducted to validate a performance measurement baseline and attain agreement of program stakeholders (e.g., agency and contractor officials) before reliable EVM reporting can begin. The establishment of a baseline depends on the completion of a work breakdown structure, an integrated master schedule, and budgets for planned work. Although the agency plans to begin reporting on the restructured program’s progress using EVM in April 2009, the agency is not yet prepared to do so because initial steps have not been completed and are dependent on decisions about the program that have not been made. Specifically, the agency has not yet developed a reliable cost estimate for the program; such an estimate, which is critical for establishing reliable EVM, is not expected to be complete until July 2009; the agency does not plan to conduct an integrated baseline review to establish a reliable performance measurement baseline before beginning EVM reporting; and the work breakdown structure and integrated master schedule that agency officials report they have developed may not accurately reflect the full scope and schedule because key program documentation, such as the concept of operations, has not been completed. This situation resembles the state of affairs that existed in January 2008, when we reported that OPM’s EVM was unreliable because an integrated baseline review had not been conducted to validate the program baseline. At that time we recommended, among other things, that the agency establish a basis for effective use of EVM by validating a program performance measurement baseline through a program-level integrated baseline review. Although the agency stated that it agreed, it did not address this recommendation. Until the agency has developed a reliable cost estimate, performed an integrated baseline review, and validated a performance measurement baseline that reflect its program restructuring, the agency is not prepared to perform reliable EVM. Engaging in EVM reporting without first performing these fundamental steps could again render the agency’s assessment unreliable. Well-defined and managed requirements are a cornerstone of effective system development and acquisition. According to recognized guidance, disciplined processes for developing and managing requirements can help reduce the risks of developing a system that does not meet user and operational needs. Such processes include (1) developing detailed requirements that have been derived from the organization’s concept of operations and are complete and sufficiently detailed to guide system development and (2) establishing policies and plans, including defining roles and responsibilities, for managing changes to requirements and maintaining bidirectional requirements traceability. OPM’s retirement modernization requirements processes include some, but not all, of the elements needed to effectively develop and manage requirements. The agency began an effort to better develop its retirement modernization requirements in November 2008. This effort was in response to the agency’s recognition that its over 1,400 requirements lacked sufficient detail, were incomplete, and required further development. The agency intends to complete this requirements development effort in April 2009. However, the requirements will not be derived from OPM’s concept of operations because the agency is revising the concept of operations expected to be completed by April 2009, to reflect the program restructuring. Further, OPM documentation indicates that the agency has not yet determined the level of detail to which requirements should be developed. Additionally, agency officials stated that OPM is developing a requirements development process for retirement modernization. With respect to requirements management, OPM developed an organizational charter that outlined roles and responsibilities for supporting efforts to manage requirements. However, the agency does not yet have a requirements management plan. OPM’s prior experience with DBTS illustrates the importance of effective requirements development and management. According to RetireEZ program officials, insufficiently detailed requirements, poorly controlled requirements changes, and inadequate requirements traceability were factors that contributed to DBTS not performing as expected. Moreover, these requirements development and management weaknesses were identified, and recommendations for improvement were made by OPM’s independent verification and validation contractor before DBTS deployment. However, the agency has not yet corrected these weaknesses. Until OPM fully establishes requirements development and management processes, the agency increases the risk that it will (1) identify requirements that are neither complete nor sufficiently detailed and (2) not effectively manage requirements changes or maintain bidirectional traceability, thus further increasing agency risk that it will produce a system that does not meet user and operational needs. Effective testing is an essential component of any program that includes developing systems. Generally, the purpose of testing is to identify defects or problems in meeting defined system requirements and satisfying user needs. To be effectively managed, testing should be planned and conducted in a structured and disciplined fashion that adheres to recognized guidance and is coordinated with the requirements development process. Beginning the test planning process in the early stages of a program life cycle can reduce rework later in the program. Early test planning in coordination with requirements development can provide major benefits. For example, planning for test activities during the development of requirements may reduce the number of defects identified later and the costs related to requirements rework or change requests. Further, planning test activities early in a program’s life cycle can inform requests for proposals and help communicate testing expectations to potential vendors. OPM has not begun to plan test activities in coordination with developing its requirements for the RetireEZ program. According to OPM officials, the agency intends to begin its test planning by revising the previously developed DBTS test plans after requirements have been developed. However, the agency has not yet added test planning to its project schedule. Early test planning is especially important to avoid repeating the agency’s experience during DBTS testing when it identified more defects than it could resolve before system deployment. In January 2008, we reported that an unexpectedly high number of defects were identified during testing; yet, the deployment schedule had increased the risk of not resolving all defects that needed to be corrected before deploying DBTS. According to the RetireEZ program officials, the failure to fully address these defects contributed to the limited number of federal employees who were successfully processed by the system when it was deployed in February 2008. If it does not plan test activities early in the life cycle of RetireEZ, OPM increases the risk that it will again deploy a system that does not satisfy user expectations and meet requirements (i.e., accurately calculate retirement benefits) because of its potential inability to address a higher number of defects than expected. Moreover, criteria used to develop requests for proposals and communicate testing expectations to potential vendors could be better informed if the agency plans RetireEZ test activities early in the life cycle. GAO and OMB guidance calls for agencies to ensure effective oversight of IT projects throughout all life-cycle phases. Critical to effective oversight are investment management boards made up of key executives who regularly track the progress of IT projects such as system acquisitions or modernizations. These boards should maintain adequate oversight and track project performance and progress toward predefined cost and schedule goals, as well as monitor project benefits and exposure to risk. Another element of effective IT oversight is employing early warning systems that enable management boards to take corrective actions at the first sign of cost, schedule, and performance slippages. OPM’s Investment Review Board was established to ensure that major investments are on track by reviewing their progress and determining appropriate actions when investments encounter challenges. Despite meeting regularly and being provided with information that indicated problems with the retirement modernization, the board did not ensure that the investment was on track, nor did it determine appropriate actions for course correction when needed. For example, from January 2007 to August 2008 the board met and was presented with reports that described problems the retirement modernization program was facing, such as the lack of an integrated master schedule and earned value data that did not reflect the “reality or current status” of the program. However, meeting minutes indicate that no discussion or action was taken to address these problems. According to a member of the board, OPM guidance regarding how the board is to communicate recommendations and corrective actions when needed for the investments it is responsible for overseeing has not been established. In addition, OPM established an Executive Steering Committee to oversee retirement modernization. According to its charter, the committee is to provide strategic direction, oversight, and issue resolution to ensure that the program maintains alignment with the mission, goals, and objectives of the agency and is supported with required resources and expertise. However, the committee was inactive for most of 2008 and, consequently, did not exercise oversight of the program during a crucial period in its development. For example, from January 2008 until October 2008, the committee discontinued its formal meetings, and as a result, it was not involved in key program decisions, including the deployment of DBTS. Further, a member of the committee noted that OPM guidance for making recommendations and taking corrective actions also has not been provided. The ineffectiveness of the board and the inactivity of the committee allowed program management weaknesses in the areas of cost estimation, EVM, requirements management, and testing to persist and raise concerns about OPM’s ability to provide meaningful oversight as the agency proceeds with its retirement modernization. Without fully functioning oversight bodies, OPM cannot monitor modernization activities and make the course corrections that effective boards and committees are intended to provide. OPM’s retirement modernization initiative is in transition from a program that was highly dependent on the success of a major contract that no longer exists, to a restructured program that has yet to be fully defined. Although the agency has been able to partially implement a database of retirement information and improvements to customer service, it remains far from implementing six other key capabilities. Recognizing that much work remains, OPM has undertaken steps to restructure the retirement modernization program, but it has not yet produced a complete description of its planned program, including fundamental information about the program’s scope, implementation strategy, lines of responsibility and authority, management processes, and schedule. Further, OPM’s retirement modernization program restructuring does not yet include definitions of results-oriented goals and measures against which program performance can be objectively and quantitatively assessed. In addition, OPM has not overcome managerial shortcomings in key areas of program management, including areas that we have previously reported. Specifically, the agency is not yet positioned to develop a reliable program cost estimate or perform reliable EVM, both of which are critical to effective program planning and oversight. Nor has OPM overcome weaknesses in its management of system testing and defects, two activities that proved problematic as the agency was preparing to deploy the RetireEZ system that subsequently was terminated. Adding to these long-standing concerns are weaknesses in OPM’s process to effectively develop and manage requirements for whatever system or service it intends to acquire or develop. Finally, these weaknesses have been allowed to persist by entities within the agency that were ineffective in overseeing the retirement modernization program. As a consequence, the agency is faced with significant challenges on two fronts: defining and transitioning to its restructured program, and addressing new and previously identified managerial weaknesses. Until OPM addresses these weaknesses, many of which were previously identified by GAO and others, the agency’s retirement modernization initiative remains at risk of failure. Institutionalizing effective planning and management is critical not only for the success of this initiative, but also for that of other modernization efforts within the agency. To improve OPM’s effort toward planning and implementing its retirement modernization program by addressing management weaknesses, we recommend that the Director of the Office of Personnel Management provide immediate attention to ensure the following six actions are taken: Develop a complete plan for the restructured program that defines the scope, implementation strategy, lines of responsibility and authority, management processes, and schedule. Further, the plan should establish results-oriented (i.e., objective, quantifiable, and measurable) goals and associated performance measures for the program. Develop a reliable cost estimate by following the best practice steps outlined in our Cost Estimating and Assessment Guide, including definition of the estimate’s purpose, development of an estimating plan, definition of the program’s characteristics, and determination of the estimating structure. Establish a basis for reliable EVM, when appropriate, by developing a reliable program cost estimate, performing an integrated baseline review, and validating a performance measurement baseline that reflects the program restructuring. Develop a requirements management plan and execute processes described in the plan to develop retirement modernization requirements in accordance with recognized guidance. Begin RetireEZ test planning activities early in the life cycle. Develop policies and procedures that would establish meaningful program oversight and require appropriate action to address management deficiencies. The Director of the Office of Personnel Management provided written comments on a draft of this report. (The comments are reproduced in app. II.) In the comments, OPM agreed with our recommendations and stated that it had begun to address them. To this end, the Director stated that the agency had, among other actions, begun revising its retirement modernization plans, developing a new program cost estimate, planning for accurate EVM reporting, incorporating recognized guidance in requirements management planning, and planning test activities during requirements development. If the recommendations are properly implemented, they should better position OPM to effectively manage its retirement modernization initiative. The agency also provided comments on the draft report regarding our description of the federal retirement application process, as well as our characterizations of OPM’s EVM and requirements management capabilities vis-à-vis the retirement modernization program. In each of these instances, we made revisions as appropriate. We are sending copies of this report to the Director of the Office of Personnel Management, appropriate congressional committees, and other interested parties. In addition, the report is available at no charge on the GAO Web site at http://www.gao.gov.

As requested, the objectives of our study were to (1) assess the status of the Office of Personnel Management’s (OPM) efforts toward planning and implementing the RetireEZ program and (2) evaluate the effectiveness of the agency’s management of the modernization initiative. To assess the status of OPM’s efforts toward planning and implementing the RetireEZ program, we reviewed and analyzed program documentation, including program management plans, briefing slides, and project status documentation, to identify planned retirement modernization capabilities and determine to what extent these capabilities have been implemented; evaluated the agency’s documentation about restructuring the program and analyzed the extent to which the documentation describes current and planned RetireEZ program activities; identified and evaluated the agency’s program goals and measures and compared them to relevant guidance to determine the extent to which the goals and measures are described in results-oriented terms; supplemented agency program documentation and our analyses by interviewing agency and contractor officials, including the OPM Director, Chief Information Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Director of Modernization, Associate Director for Human Resources Products and Services Division, and executives from Hewitt Associates and Northrop Grumman Corporation; and observed retirement operations and ongoing modernization activities at OPM and contractor facilities in Washington, D.C.; Boyers, Pennsylvania; and Herndon, Virginia. To determine the effectiveness of OPM’s management of the retirement modernization initiative, we evaluated the agency’s management of program cost estimating, earned value management (EVM), requirements, test planning, and oversight and compared the agency’s work in each area with recognized best practices and guidance. Specifically, to evaluate whether OPM effectively developed a reliable program cost estimate, we analyzed the agency’s program documentation and determined to what extent the agency had completed key activities described in our Cost Estimating and Assessment Guide; to assess OPM’s implementation of EVM, we reviewed program progress reporting documentation and compared the agency’s plans for restarting its EVM-based progress reporting against relevant guidance, including our Cost Estimating and Assessment Guide; regarding requirements management, we evaluated OPM’s processes for developing and managing retirement systems modernization requirements and compared the effectiveness of those processes against recognized guidance; to determine the effectiveness of the agency’s test planning for the retirement modernization, we reviewed program activities and test plans against best practices and evaluated the extent to which the agency has begun planning for these activities; and we reviewed and analyzed documentation from program oversight entities and evaluated the extent to which these entities took actions toward ensuring the RetireEZ program was being effectively overseen. We also evaluated OPM’s progress toward implementing our open recommendations and interviewed OPM and contractor officials as noted. We conducted this performance audit at OPM headquarters in Washington, D.C., the Retirement Operations Center for OPM in Boyers, Pennsylvania, and contractor facilities in Herndon, Virginia, from May 2008 through April 2009, in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives.

Smith.","For the past two decades, the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) has been working to modernize the paper-intensive processes and antiquated systems used to support the retirement of federal employees. By moving to an automated system, OPM intends to improve the program's efficiency and effectiveness. In January 2008, GAO recommended that the agency address risks to successful system deployment. Nevertheless, OPM deployed a limited initial version of the modernized system in February 2008. After unsuccessful efforts to address system quality issues, OPM suspended system operation, terminated a major contract, and began restructuring the modernization effort, also referred to as RetireEZ. For this study, GAO was asked to (1) assess the status of OPM's efforts to plan and implement the RetireEZ program and (2) evaluate the effectiveness of the agency's management of the modernization initiative. To do this, GAO reviewed OPM program documentation and interviewed agency and contractor officials. OPM remains far from achieving the modernized capabilities it had planned. Specifically, the agency has partially implemented two of eight planned capabilities: (1) an integrated database of retirement information accessible to OPM and agency retirement processing personnel and (2) enhanced customer service capabilities that support customer needs and provide self-service tools. However, the remaining six capabilities have yet to be implemented because they depended on deliverables that were to be provided by a contract that is now terminated. Examples of these missing capabilities include: (1) automated submission of retirement information through interfaces with federal agencies and (2) Web-accessible self-service retirement information for active and retired federal employees. Further, OPM has not yet developed a complete plan that describes how the program is to proceed without the system that was to be provided under the terminated contract. Although agency documents describe program implementation activities, they do not include a definition of the program, its scope, lines of responsibility and authority, management processes, and a schedule. Also, modernization program documentation does not describe results-oriented performance goals and measures. Until the agency completes and uses a plan that includes all of the above elements to guide its efforts, it will not be properly positioned to move forward with its restructured retirement modernization initiative. Further, OPM has significant weaknesses in five key management areas that are vital for effective development and implementation of its modernization program: cost estimating, earned value management (a recognized means for measuring program progress), requirements management, testing, and oversight. For example, the agency has not developed a cost estimating plan or established a performance measurement baseline--prerequisites for effective cost estimating and earned value management. Further, although OPM is revising its previously developed system requirements, it has not established processes and plans to guide this work or addressed test activities even though developing processes and plans, as well as planning test activities early in the life cycle, are recognized best practices for effective requirements development and testing. Finally, although OPM's Executive Steering Committee and Investment Review Board have recently become more active regarding RetireEZ, these bodies did not exercise effective oversight in the past, which has allowed the aforementioned management weaknesses to persist and OPM has not established guidance regarding how these entities are to intervene when corrective actions are needed. Until OPM addresses these weaknesses, many of which GAO and others made recommendations to correct, the agency's retirement modernization initiative remains at risk of failure. Institutionalizing effective management is critical not only for the success of this initiative, but also for that of other modernization efforts within the agency.",govreport
"In recent years, automobiles have been associated with nearly 29,000 traffic fatalities annually in the United States, including the deaths of both automobile occupants and others involved in collisions with automobiles.The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), a unit of the Department of Transportation (DOT), has the lead role in federal government efforts to reduce the number of traffic crashes and to minimize their consequences. Some types of automobiles have higher fatality rates than others. (For example, small cars generally have higher rates than large cars.) In addition, some categories of drivers are more likely to be involved in serious crashes than others. (Young drivers, for example, have higher involvement rates than other drivers.) However, as we previously reported, one cannot conclude from differences in fatality rates that some types of cars, or some types of drivers, are in fact more dangerous than others, because driver and automobile characteristics are highly related (GAO, 1991). For example, since small cars have a disproportionate percentage of young drivers, do the high fatality rates for those cars stem from vehicle characteristics or the recklessness with which they are operated? The goal of this report is to isolate the independent effects of important crash-related factors on the likelihood of injury in a collision. The report focuses on the most important predictors of occupant injury in a collision: crash type and crash severity, automobile size, safety belt use, and occupant age and gender. The report is concerned with both crashworthiness (protecting automobile occupants) and aggressivity (protecting other roadway users struck by automobiles). The report also considers prospects for improving the safety of automobile occupants. This report is one of three GAO reports examining automobile safety. One of these, Highway Safety: Factors Affecting Involvement in Vehicle Crashes (GAO, 1994), examines the independent effects of driver characteristics and automobile size on crash involvement. Another, Highway Safety: Reliability and Validity of DOT Crash Tests (GAO/PEMD-95-5), looks at the extent to which results from the crash test programs conducted by NHTSA accurately predict injury in actual automobile crashes. Since the mid-1960’s, both the number of traffic fatalities and the fatality rate per registered vehicle have sharply decreased in the United States. The fatality rate for automobile occupants has declined by 36 percent since 1975. The continued emphases on reducing drunk driving and increasing safety belt use, along with the introduction of antilock brakes, air bags, and other safety enhancing features, have increased the chances that this favorable trend will continue. Nonetheless, in 1991 automobiles were associated with nearly 29,000 traffic deaths in the United States.About 22,000 of the automobile-related fatalities were automobile occupants (about 10,000 killed in single-car collisions and 12,000 in multiple-vehicle collisions), about 2,500 were occupants of other types of vehicles (for example, light trucks, vans, or motorcycles) involved in collisions with automobiles, and approximately 4,000 were pedestrians or cyclists hit by automobiles. (See table 1.1.) Different models of automobiles appear to make very different contributions to this fatality toll. For instance, the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS) has reported that the most “dangerous” automobile models have occupant fatality rates more than nine times higher than the “safest” models. Further, some of the automobile characteristics associated with this variation in fatality rates are well known. For instance, sports cars have higher fatality rates than station wagons, and small cars have higher fatality rates than large cars. However, this does not mean that types of automobiles with high fatality rates are necessarily more dangerous than those with low fatality rates. This is because different types of drivers prefer particular types of automobiles, affecting both the number of collisions involving particular autos and, perhaps, the probability of serious injury in the event of a collision. For example, young drivers are much more likely to be involved in fatal accidents than others—drivers age 16 to 20 are involved in fatal accidents at a rate three times higher than that for drivers age 45 to 54—thereby inflating the fatality rate for types of cars preferred by young drivers. Similarly, some types of automobile occupants are more likely to be seriously injured in a collision than others. For example, in collisions in which at least one vehicle was towed from the accident scene, NHTSA (1992a) recently estimated that women automobile occupants are about 36 percent more likely to be hurt than men occupants in similar collisions. This suggests that types of cars with a disproportionate number of women occupants may have higher fatality rates than other cars. As automobiles abruptly stop or change direction in a collision, occupants continue moving in the original direction of travel. This independent movement of an occupant within a rigid vehicle that is decelerating more quickly than its occupant provides several opportunities for injury. First, some occupants are injured by being ejected (either partially or totally) from the vehicle. Ejection substantially increases the risk of serious injury—ejected occupants are three to four times more likely to be killed in a collision than occupants who do not leave the vehicle. Second, occupants can collide with the interior of the vehicle or other objects intruding into the passenger compartment. This “second collision” (following the “first collision” of the automobile striking an object) is understandably worse if it occurs at high speed, involves impact with a sharp or unyielding portion of the car’s interior, or involves contact with part of another vehicle or a roadside object that has penetrated the passenger compartment. Finally, because different portions of an occupant’s body decelerate at different rates, internal injuries can be caused by the “third collision” of soft tissues against hard, bony structures. For example, in high-speed collisions, the skull decelerates more quickly than the brain, potentially causing injury to the brain as it strikes the hard skull. Automobiles, and federal automobile safety regulations, are designed to protect their occupants from these dangers in several ways. One way is to attempt to reduce the deceleration forces acting on occupants. Deceleration forces can be reduced by designing the structure of a vehicle to absorb as much energy as possible before the crash forces are transmitted to the passenger compartment or by giving the occupant more time to slow down, thereby reducing the maximum force level the occupant is subjected to. The latter can be accomplished by starting the deceleration period more quickly (for example, by designing safety belts that begin holding back the occupant sooner) or by increasing the total deceleration period (for example, by lengthening the front end of the vehicle). Another way cars may protect their occupants is by encasing them in a protective compartment that preserves a living space and prevents the intrusion into the passenger compartment of striking vehicles or other objects (such as light posts or trees) that a car hits. Third, automobiles are designed to keep their occupants both in the vehicle and away from interior surfaces. This is most obviously accomplished through the use of safety belts, but a number of other components are also intended to keep the occupant in the vehicle, including door latches and windshields that are reinforced to eliminate potential ejection routes. In addition, automobile interiors are designed to absorb energy from the occupant and to limit the occupant’s movement rather than serve as a rigid barrier. Energy absorbing steering columns are one example. There is little doubt that cars from recent model years, as a group, are safer than automobiles from past model years and that some of this improvement can be attributed to federal government safety regulations. For instance, in comparing the crash test results of cars from model years 1980 and 1991, NHTSA researchers found that one set of scores measuring injury potential had declined about 30 percent during the intervening years (Hackney, 1991). Similarly, Evans (1991b) estimated that the total effect of nine federal motor vehicle safety standards enacted by 1989 had been to reduce the occupant fatality rate by about 11 percent. The objective of this report is to examine the independent effects of a number of factors—crash type, crash severity, automobile weight and size, safety belt use, and occupant age and gender—on the risk of injury in an automobile crash. We are concerned with both crashworthiness and aggressivity. Crashworthiness refers to the extent to which automobiles protect their occupants in a collision, and aggressivity refers to automobile characteristics that affect the safety of the occupants of the other vehicles in a collision. We restricted the scope of the study in several ways in order to obtain a clear picture of the most important phenomena. First, we looked only at the safety of automobile occupants and the dangers automobiles pose to occupants of other vehicles. We were not directly concerned with factors affecting the safety of occupants of other types of passenger vehicles, such as pickup trucks, vans, minivans, and multipurpose vehicles; we considered these vehicles only as they affect the safety of automobile drivers in two-vehicle collisions. In our judgment, concerns about the safety of light trucks and other passenger vehicles differ significantly from that of automobiles. Light trucks and other passenger vehicles are less stable and thus roll over more frequently than automobiles, and they have been subject to less stringent safety regulations than automobiles. Second, our statistical analysis focused on model year 1987 and later cars, because the safety experiences of those cars are more likely to apply to today’s new cars than are the safety experiences of older ones. Finally, we considered in our analysis only the injury experiences of drivers, not those of automobile passengers or factors specifically affecting the safety of child occupants. (Roughly half of the automobiles on the road have no occupants other than the driver.) To meet our objective, we reviewed technical reports from NHTSA and other sources and consulted auto safety experts and representatives of automobile manufacturers. We also conducted our own statistical analyses of traffic safety databases obtained from NHTSA. Our primary data set was compiled from the National Accident Sampling System—Crashworthiness Data System (NASS) for 1988 through 1991. NASS is a nationally representative probability sample of all police-reported crashes involving a passenger car, light truck, or van in which at least one vehicle was towed from the scene. In addition, all the automobiles included in NASS were towed from the crash site. Thus, the automobiles in NASS, as a whole, are much more likely to have injured occupants than are cars involved in typical crashes. Not only are police-reported crashes more severe than those not reported to the police, but tow-away crashes on the whole are also more severe than those not involving tow-aways. Indeed, almost all serious occupant injuries occur in police-reported tow-away collisions. For our analysis, we selected a subset of cases from the NASS data for 1988 through 1991. We included all one-car collisions involving a 1987 or newer model year automobile and all collisions between a model year 1987 or later automobile and any other car, van, pickup truck, or other light truck. These crash types, taken together, accounted for about 81 percent of all automobile occupant fatalities in 1991. The remaining 19 percent occurred in types of crashes that we did not include in our data set because of a lack of cases, principally collisions with medium and heavy trucks (about 10 percent of the 1991 total). In our statistical analyses, we used logistic regression to look at the independent contributions of a variety of factors on the probability of driver injury. Driver injury was indexed with a dichotomous outcome variable coded “1” if the driver was hospitalized or killed in the crash and “0” otherwise. The regression analysis allowed us to isolate the effects of one factor (for example, automobile weight) while statistically holding constant the other factors (for example, collision severity as well as driver age and gender). Regression analysis answers the question: If there were no differences among these drivers except for the factor of automobile weight, for example, how would that factor predict the probability of driver injury? (The data sets and analyses are described in appendix I.) The studies that we reviewed from the traffic safety literature differed in several ways that increase the difficulty of comparing their results and of relating their conclusions to our own findings. For instance, some studies focused on injuries to automobile drivers, as we did, while others examined injuries to all automobile occupants, not just drivers. Similarly, different studies looked at slightly different sets of automobile crashes—at tow-away crashes (as we did) or at all police-reported crashes or only at crashes in which a fatality occurred. In addition, the studies employed different outcome measures. Our analysis concerned driver hospitalizations or deaths, while other studies looked only at fatalities or at injuries considered serious or worse or at injuries categorized as moderately severe or worse, for example. While these and other differences mean that the studies we cite rarely produced precisely equivalent findings, in most the findings were roughly the same. In particular, the direction of the findings was almost always the same (that is, whether a factor increases or decreases the risk of injury), and there was usually approximate agreement about the size of the effect (that is, whether a factor has a large effect on injury risk or only a minor influence). Our work was performed in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. Chapter 2 looks at the effects of crash type and crash severity. It also discusses the effects of automobile size and safety belt use in three different configurations: one-car rollover crashes, one-car nonrollover crashes, and collisions between cars and other light vehicles. Chapter 3 examines the influence of driver age and gender on injury probability. Chapter 4 discusses the relative contributions of driver and automobile factors to driver injury. Chapter 5 discusses the potential for improving automobile safety. Appendix I describes our data set and statistical analyses. This chapter discusses the safety consequences of crash characteristics, automobile weight and size, and safety belts and air bags. The chapter begins with a discussion of crash characteristics that are related to occupant injury, including the injury risk associated with one-car rollover crashes, one-car nonrollover crashes, and collisions with an automobile, a van, or a light truck. It then examines the safety consequences of automobile weight and size as well as of safety belt use in the different crashes. Each section summarizes relevant findings from the literature and then presents the results of our analyses of the NASS data. The chapter ends with a look at the effects of air bags. The great majority of traffic crashes do not involve serious injury. A large proportion of all traffic crashes are not reported to the police (Evans, 1991b). And NHTSA has estimated that about one third of crashes reported to the police involve personal injury (two thirds having property damage only) and that just 6 percent involve a severe or fatal injury (NHTSA, 1991b). Nonetheless, some crashes are much more likely to lead to serious injury than others. First, some types of crashes are more severe than others. Overall, single-car crashes are more likely to seriously injure occupants than are multiple-vehicle collisions. Single-vehicle crashes account for about 30 percent of police-reported crashes annually, yet in 1991 about 45 percent of all automobile occupant fatalities were in these collisions. Single-car rollover crashes are particularly dangerous, accounting for only about 2 percent of all police-reported accidents but about 20 percent of occupant fatalities (NHTSA, 1991b). A major reason for the relative severity of single-car crashes is that most crashes involving drunk drivers are single-car incidents, and crashes involving drunk drivers tend to be more severe than other collisions. For example, NHTSA reported that 53 percent of drivers killed in single-vehicle crashes in 1991 were intoxicated, compared with only 21 percent of the drivers killed in multiple-vehicle collisions (NHTSA, 1993b). Second, for nonrollover crashes, some points of impact on the automobile are more dangerous than others. The preponderance of fatal crashes other than rollovers involve frontal impacts, followed at a distance by left- and right-side impacts. For example, table 2.1 indicates that 43 percent of all automobile occupant fatalities in 1991 occurred in frontal impacts, or more than half of all fatalities that did not occur in single-car rollovers. Third, crashes at high speeds are more dangerous than others. For example, Joksch (1993) estimated that the risk to drivers of fatal injury in two-car collisions was about 1 percent for a 20 mph collision, 10 percent for a 35 mph collision, and 44 percent for a collision involving a change in velocity of 50 mph. NHTSA (1993e) recently reported similar findings for restrained vehicle occupants, noting, for instance, that the probability of fatal injury is about nine times as great in frontal collisions with a change of velocity of 40 mph as in those with a change of 30 mph. That the probability of death increases sharply with impact speed is one reason for the predominance of frontal impacts in fatal crashes, since frontal impacts are likely to involve cars that are moving forward. Here we report how injury risk and driver and automobile characteristics vary by crash type. Our data, from NASS, were for model year 1987 and later cars in three types of police-reported tow-away crashes in 1988-91: one-car rollovers, one-car nonrollovers, and collisions with other cars, vans, and light trucks. The pattern of injury risk by crash type that we found in the NASS data set reflects the pattern described in the literature. As table 2.2 indicates, one-car crashes are more dangerous than multivehicle collisions. One-car rollover crashes, in particular, are much more dangerous than other crash types, with a rate of driver hospitalization or death that is double that of one-car nonrollover crashes and four times that of collisions with cars and light trucks. In addition to having a higher rate of driver injury, one-car crashes are disproportionately likely to involve men drivers and young drivers. (See table 2.2.) We found that about 60 percent of the drivers in one-car crashes were men, compared with approximately 46 percent in two-vehicle collisions. In addition, while close to half of the drivers in one-car crashes were 16 to 24 years of age, only about one third of the drivers in collisions with other cars or light trucks were that young. These findings are consistent with those of our companion report, Highway Safety: Factors Affecting Involvement in Vehicle Crashes (GAO, 1994), in which we found that driver age and gender are more strongly related to involvement in single-vehicle crashes than they are to involvement in two-vehicle collisions. In addition, as table 2.2 indicates, the average curb weight of automobiles in one-car rollover crashes was somewhat lower than that of cars involved in other crashes. As we noted in Highway Safety: Factors Affecting Involvement in Vehicle Crashes, involvement in rollover crashes increases as automobile weight decreases. Just as the literature suggests, we found that the risk of injury to drivers is significantly affected by impact point. In particular, we found that two-vehicle collisions involving head-on impacts between vehicles moving in opposite directions are much more dangerous than other two-vehicle crashes. The risk of driver injury or death is about five times as great in head-on collisions as in other two-vehicle collisions. For crashes other than head-on collisions, frontal impacts and left-side impacts had higher rates of driver hospitalization or death than others. Finally, we found that high impact speeds are, not surprisingly, more dangerous than low impact speeds. Considering the three crash types together, we estimated that each increase of 10 mph in the change of velocity at impact increases the probability of driver hospitalization or death nearly sevenfold. As we have previously reported, safety experts agree that, in general, heavier and larger cars are both more crashworthy and more aggressive than lighter and smaller automobiles (GAO, 1991). Thus, in the event of a collision, occupants are less likely to be hurt when they are in heavier and larger cars and when they are struck by lighter and smaller cars. However, there is some disagreement in the literature about which is the more important dimension for occupant safety, weight or exterior size (that is, overall length and width). Proponents of weight as the important dimension argue that automobile mass protects occupants from injury because it is aggressive—that is, heavier cars knock down objects and push other vehicles back, thereby transferring momentum and energy to the struck object, including other vehicles, that could otherwise affect occupants of the striking vehicle (see, for example, Evans and Frick, 1992). In contrast, proponents of exterior size as the more important dimension maintain that large vehicles protect their occupants by absorbing crash energy without increasing the injury risk of other roadway users (for example, see Robertson, 1991). In most cases, this debate is of little practical significance now, since weight and exterior size are very highly correlated—that is, heavy cars are almost invariably also long and wide—but it has important implications for the design of future automobiles. If exterior size is the more important dimension, using lighter weight materials could make future automobiles lighter without decreasing exterior size, thus increasing fuel efficiency without exacting a safety cost. Conversely, using lighter weight materials would involve a safety cost if weight is the more important dimension. In addition, estimates of the amount of additional protection offered by a given increase in automobile weight vary considerably. For example, consider the effects of a 500-pound increase in the weight of one automobile in a collision with another, assuming no change in the weight of the latter. Klein, Hertz, and Borener (1991) used data from two states to generate two different estimates of the decreased risk of serious driver injury from that automobile weight increase—13 percent and 20 percent. Other estimates are higher. For example, Evans (1982) concluded that this increase in automobile weight would reduce a driver’s risk of fatal injury by about 29 percent. Further, the protective effect of automobile size appears to differ by crash type. First, it is likely that this effect is somewhat less pronounced in one-car nonrollover crashes than in multivehicle collisions (Evans, 1991b). For example, in the 1991 paper by Klein and colleagues, NHTSA researchers estimated that a 500-pound increase in automobile weight reduces the risk of driver fatality by not quite 5 percent in one-car nonrollover crashes, somewhat less than the estimates of 13 percent and 20 percent for two-car collisions. Second, although it is well documented that small cars are much more likely to be involved in one-car rollover crashes than are large cars (see, for example, GAO, 1994), the literature is less clear about the safety consequences of automobile size once a rollover has occurred. On the one hand, in examining the effects of reduced automobile weight and size on safety in rollover crashes, some researchers have focused on the increased number of rollover crashes among light and small cars (Evans, 1991b; Kahane, 1990; NHTSA, 1991a). The implication of these studies is that automobile weight and size do not affect crashworthiness in rollovers; otherwise, these researchers would have included weight and size as factors in their calculations. On the other hand, some direct studies of crashworthiness in rollovers have found that drivers of larger cars are more likely to be injured than drivers of smaller cars in rollovers (see, for example, Partyka and Boehly, 1989). One explanation for this finding is that it takes more energy to roll over a heavy automobile than a light one, meaning that the typical rollover crash involving heavy autos is more severe (that is, occurs at a higher speed) than the typical rollover involving light cars (see, for example, Terhune, 1991). After combining all the crashes in our database (one-car rollovers, one-car nonrollovers, and collisions with cars and light trucks), we found that the risk of injury to drivers was significantly reduced as car weight and wheelbase increased in our sample. (See figure 2.1.) We estimated that the risk of driver hospitalization or death decreases about 14 percent for every additional 500 pounds of automobile weight and about 13 percent for each additional 5 inches of wheelbase. (See tables I.1 and I.2.) Further, considering all crash types taken together, we could not statistically differentiate the injury reduction effects of curb weight and wheelbase. That is, the benefits of increasing weight and wheelbase were roughly equivalent in reducing injuries, and we were unable to establish that one had a stronger influence than the other. The nearly equivalent slopes of the lines for weight and wheelbase in figure 2.1 demonstrate this. The endpoints of the lines in figure 2.1 represent approximately the 5th and 95th percentiles of automobile weight and wheelbase in this data set. Thus, 2,000-pound cars are among the lightest and 3,600-pound cars are among the heaviest in this database of cars involved in serious crashes; similarly, cars with a wheelbase of 93 inches are among the shortest, 113 inches among the longest. Figure 2.1 shows that, for all three crash types taken together, whether measured by weight or wheelbase, drivers in the heaviest and largest cars had a risk of hospitalization or death about 40 percent less than the drivers of the lightest and smallest cars. However, these overall effects mask the fact that automobile weight and wheelbase have very different safety consequences in different types of crashes. Figure 2.2 shows the estimated effects of curb weight separately for the three crash types (see also tables I.3-I.5); figure 2.3, the estimated effects of wheelbase (see also tables I.6-I.8). Most importantly, although increasing weight and wheelbase reduces the risk of driver injury in one-car nonrollover crashes and in collisions with other cars or light trucks, drivers in heavier cars were much more likely to be hospitalized or killed in one-car rollover crashes than were drivers of lighter automobiles. For one-car rollover crashes, we estimated that each 500 pounds of additional automobile weight increases the risk of driver hospitalization or death by about 59 percent. This effect is solely a function of automobile weight, not of wheelbase; we found that the relationship between wheelbase and driver injury was not statistically significant in one-car rollovers. This finding agrees with the report of Partyka and Boehly (1989) that drivers of heavier and larger cars are more likely to be injured in rollovers than drivers of lighter and smaller cars. This finding is also consistent with the explanation that it takes more energy to roll over a heavy automobile than a light one, meaning that rollover crashes involving heavy autos occur at higher speeds than rollovers involving light cars. However, it is important to keep in mind that the rate of involvement in one-car rollover crashes is much greater for light cars than for heavy ones, so this finding does not necessarily mean that, considering both involvement and crashworthiness, drivers of heavy cars are more likely to suffer injuries in one-car rollovers. Figures 2.2 and 2.3 also show that we found a tendency for the risk of driver hospitalization or death to decrease with increasing car weight and size in one-car nonrollover crashes, but neither curb weight nor wheelbase was a statistically significant predictor of driver injury in those crashes. In contrast, we found that in collisions with other cars and light trucks, both automobile weight and wheelbase were statistically significant predictors of driver injury. In those crashes, we estimate that each additional 500 pounds of automobile weight decreased the risk of driver hospitalization or death by about 23 percent and each 5 inches of additional wheelbase lowered the risk of driver injury approximately 19 percent. These findings reflect the pattern, described in the literature, that the protective effects of automobile weight and wheelbase are somewhat greater in multivehicle collisions than in single-car nonrollover crashes. In two-vehicle collisions, the injury risk of an automobile occupant is affected not only by the characteristics of his or her own automobile but also by the characteristics of the other vehicle. We looked at the effects of the weight and vehicle type of the other vehicle on the probability of injury for the first driver: both factors affect the aggressivity of the other vehicle. First, not surprisingly, heavier vehicles pose more of a risk than lighter vehicles. (See figure 2.4.) In our analysis, each increase of 500 pounds in the weight of the other vehicle increased the probability of hospitalization or death by about 13 percent, holding other factors constant. (See table I.5.) It is important to note that the magnitude of this aggressive effect of vehicle weight is less than that of the protective effect of weight described earlier. (We estimated that each additional 500 pounds of automobile weight reduces the probability of injury by about 23 percent.) After statistically controlling for the influence of other factors, we found that this ratio of the protective effect to the aggressive effect of automobile weight of 1.77 to 1 is roughly consistent with the findings of other researchers. For example, Klein, Hertz, and Borener (1991), analyzing data from two different states, generated two estimates of the size of this ratio in two-car collisions: 1.54 to 1 and 1.30 to 1. Second, figure 2.5 shows that driver injury risk is strongly influenced by the body type of the other vehicle. We found that while pickup trucks do not pose more danger than automobiles, vans and other light trucks are more aggressive than automobiles. Indeed, statistically controlling for the weight of the driver’s car and of the other vehicle, we estimate that the risk of hospitalization or death for the driver is more than twice as great in collisions with vans and light trucks than with other cars or light vehicles. (See also table I.5.) This finding reflects two characteristics of vans and light trucks. One is that because vans and light trucks can carry heavy cargo loads, these vehicles may be, in reality, heavier than the curb weight measurements available to us indicate. The second characteristic is that the structure and design of vans and other light trucks make those vehicles especially dangerous for automobile occupants in two-vehicle collisions (National Research Council, 1992; Terhune and Ranney, 1984). Safety belts greatly reduce the risk of injury and death in roadway crashes. In a recent review of studies of safety belt effectiveness, we concluded that most studies show that belted vehicle occupants have a risk of serious injury or death that is approximately 50 to 75 percent less than that of unrestrained occupants (GAO, 1992). Other researchers have found safety belts to have slightly smaller effects. For example, NHTSA (1993d) estimated that when manual lap and shoulder safety belts are used in serious crashes, they reduce fatality risk by 45 percent. Similarly, Evans (1986) estimated that three-point lap and shoulder safety belts reduce a driver’s risk of fatality by about 43 percent, with about half of that benefit the result of eliminating or attenuating impacts with the interior of the vehicle and about half the result of preventing occupant ejection. There are three other important points about safety belt effectiveness. First, the effectiveness of safety belts varies by crash type. Belts are most effective in rollover crashes because they largely prevent occupant ejection (Evans, 1990; Partyka, 1988). They are also more effective in one-car crashes than in multivehicle collisions. For example, Evans and Frick (1986) estimated that safety belts reduce the risk of driver fatality in one-car crashes by 62 percent but by only 30 percent in two-car crashes. Second, belt effectiveness also varies by point of impact. Belts are most effective in frontal impacts and least effective in left-side impacts (Evans, 1990). Since one-car crashes are more likely to involve frontal impacts than are two-car collisions, this offers one possible explanation for the greater efficacy of safety belts in one-car crashes. Third, it is likely that manual lap and shoulder belts are somewhat more effective than other safety belt configurations. For example, Evans (1991a) estimated that lap and shoulder belts reduce fatality risk in serious collisions by about 41 percent, compared with estimated risk reductions of 18 percent for lap belts only and 29 percent for shoulder belts only. Evans speculated that these two components have somewhat different functions, with lap belts primarily preventing ejection and shoulder belts mitigating contact with the interior of the vehicle. Comparing manual lap and shoulder belts to automatic belts, NHTSA (1993d) estimated that automatic safety belts, when used in serious crashes, reduce the risk of fatality by 42.5 percent, compared with an estimated fatality reduction of 45 percent for manual lap and shoulder belts. Considering all three crash types together, NASS researchers categorized 73 percent of the drivers in the NASS data set as using a safety belt at the time of collision, with those involved in one-car rollovers slightly less likely to be belted than others. This figure is higher than might be expected from the results of other estimates of safety belt use among the general driving population, particularly given that drivers involved in crashes are less likely to wear safety belts than others and that all the drivers included in our analysis had been involved in a crash. In one point of comparison, NHTSA estimated a 51-percent safety belt usage rate for all passenger cars in 1991 (NHTSA, 1992a). Further, it is well established that unbelted drivers are more reckless than belted drivers (Evans and Wasielewski, 1983; Evans, 1987; Preusser, Williams, and Lund, 1991; Stewart, 1993). As a result, unbelted drivers have much higher crash involvement rates than belted drivers: NHTSA (1992a) estimated that unbelted drivers have an involvement rate in potentially fatal crashes that is more than double that of belted drivers. We cannot determine with certainty if, or to what degree, the safety belt use figures reported in NASS are incorrect, nor can we determine with certainty the extent to which any potential bias in those figures affected our analyses. For that reason, our results should be interpreted with caution. Nonetheless, because the results of our analyses concerning the relative effectiveness of different safety belt configurations in different types of crashes are consistent with the findings from the traffic safety literature, we believe that any potential bias has not seriously affected our findings. For each of the three categories of crashes, we examined the performance of three safety belt configurations: (1) manual lap and shoulder belts, (2) automatic and manual belts combined (most commonly automatic shoulder belts and manual lap belts), and (3) automatic belts without manual components. Other safety belt configurations, including manual lap belts alone, had too few cases in the data set for us to estimate their effectiveness. Statistically controlling for crash severity, driver characteristics, and other background factors, we found that, compared with unbelted drivers, drivers using any of the three safety belt configurations had greatly reduced risks of injury. We also found that, looking at the three types of crashes together, manual lap and shoulder belts were somewhat more effective in preventing driver injury than the other configurations. (See figure 2.6.) Compared with unbelted drivers, the estimated risk of hospitalization or death was reduced about 70 percent for those using manual lap and shoulder belts, about 63 percent for those using automatic and manual belts combined, and about 54 percent for those using automatic belts without manual components. (See also table I.1.) We also found small variations in safety belt performance among the different types of crashes. Safety belts were somewhat less effective in collisions with other cars or light trucks than they were in single-car crashes. For example, in our analysis, manual lap and shoulder belts reduced the risk of driver hospitalization or death by 83 percent in one-car rollover crashes and by 80 percent in one-car nonrollover crashes but by only 64 percent in collisions with other cars or light trucks. (See tables I.3-I.5.) Evaluations of the effectiveness of air bags are hampered by the relatively small number of cars now equipped with them (although all passenger cars, vans, and light trucks will be required to have both driver- and passenger-side air bags by the 1998 model year). There were too few automobiles with air bags in the NASS data set for us to conduct our own analysis of air bag effectiveness. Nonetheless, some of the characteristics of air bag performance have already been established. First, air bags are effective only in frontal impacts; they do not protect drivers in side impacts or other nonfrontal collisions (see, for example, Zador and Ciccone, 1993). While frontal impacts account for by far the greatest proportion of automobile occupant fatalities, more than half of occupant fatalities do not involve frontal impacts. (See table 2.1.) Second, air bags offer additional protection to drivers already wearing safety belts. Researchers have found that belted drivers with air bags are about 10 percent less likely to be fatally injured than are belted drivers without air bags (Evans, 1991b; Zador and Ciccone, 1993). For example, NHTSA (1993d) estimated that lap and shoulder safety belts alone reduce automobile driver fatality risk by about 45 percent. In that paper, NHTSA also estimated that drivers with lap and shoulder belts and air bags are about 50 percent less likely to be killed than unbelted drivers, for a safety increment of close to 10 percent (50/45 = 1.11, or about 10 percent). Finally, safety belts alone are much more effective than air bags alone. Estimates of the effectiveness of air bags for drivers who do not wear safety belts indicate that those drivers are approximately 20 to 30 percent less likely to be killed in a collision than are unbelted drivers without air bags (NHTSA, 1993d; Zador and Ciccone, 1993). In contrast, as noted previously, drivers wearing lap and shoulder safety belts are, by the most conservative estimate, 41 percent less likely to be killed than unbelted drivers. DOT had one general comment concerning the topics presented in this chapter: it maintained that the subset of the NASS data we used in the report is inappropriate for studying the effect of car size on safety and, more particularly, that the sample size is inadequate for assessing the consequences of changing the weight of both vehicles in a two-vehicle collision. We disagree. As the findings presented in this chapter demonstrate, the NASS data set we constructed clearly was adequate for uncovering a number of statistically significant relationships (the analyses are described in appendix I). In addition, our findings are similar to NHTSA’s findings from statistical analyses of state accident databases (particularly concerning the effects of the weights of both vehicles in two-car collisions; see Klein, Hertz, and Borener, 1991) and to NHTSA’s findings from statistical analyses of a slightly different NASS database (see table I.1 and NHTSA, 1992a, p. 72). Safety researchers have consistently found that women automobile occupants have a greater risk of injury in a collision than men and that the risk of injury increases with occupant age. For example, NHTSA (1992a) found that women vehicle occupants involved in tow-away crashes are 36 percent more likely than men to suffer an injury categorized as moderately severe or worse. NHTSA also found that the risk of moderate injury increases about 2 percent for each year of age, meaning that, compared with 20-year-olds, 30-year-olds have a 21-percent greater risk of injury and 60-year-olds are more than twice as likely to be injured. Similarly, Evans (1988b) reported that 30-year-old women have a fatality risk in traffic crashes about 31-percent higher than 30-year-old men and that the risk of fatality increases about 2 percent for each year of age. Our analysis of the NASS data set of police-reported tow-away crashes produced similar findings. For statistically equivalent crashes, we found that women drivers are about 29 percent more likely to be hospitalized or killed than men drivers. We also found that drivers 65 and older are about 4.5 times more likely to be seriously hurt than drivers 16 to 24 years old in equivalent crashes. (See table I.1.) One explanation for the greater vulnerability of women drivers and older drivers emphasizes their inherent physical frailty. This view postulates that the same degree of physical trauma is more likely to produce injury in women than in men and in older automobile occupants than in younger ones, because women and older people are physically less resilient than men and younger people. Indeed, there is some support for the view that women are physically more vulnerable than men (Evans, 1988b), and that older people are more fragile than younger ones is well documented (for example, Mackay, 1988; Pike, 1989). The implication of this view is that the greater vulnerability of women and older persons is not amenable to correction through automobile design changes, because weaker individuals will be hurt more often than stronger ones no matter what. Other possible explanations have not been carefully developed in the literature, but they tend to involve speculation that some characteristic of the vulnerable group interacts with automobile design to cause a safety problem. For example, because women are shorter than men, on the average, they may sit closer to the steering wheel, causing them to hit the steering column more quickly in a crash. Similarly, the interaction of lower height and safety belts designed for average-sized drivers may oblige women, for reasons of comfort, to wear safety belts incorrectly more than men do, thereby increasing the injury risk of ostensibly belted women drivers relative to that of belted men drivers (see, for example, National Transportation Safety Board, 1988). Here, we discuss whether the factors we examined in chapter 2 differentially affect the probability of injury of women and men and of older and younger drivers. If the “inherent frailty” view is correct, women should be injured more than men, and older drivers more than younger drivers, regardless of crash type, automobile weight, or safety belt use. If any of these factors affect the relationship between gender or age and injury risk, the credibility of this view would be called into question, as this would mean that something other than frailty also makes an important difference. It would also indicate that the safety of women and older drivers could be at least somewhat improved by automobile design changes. Crash Type. The pattern of injury by crash type varies for women drivers and men drivers. Multivehicle collisions are a greater source of injury for women than they are for men. Figure 3.1 shows our finding that 67 percent of the women drivers hospitalized or killed were injured in collisions with cars and light trucks, with only one third injured in one-car crashes (11 percent in rollovers, 22 percent in nonrollovers). In contrast, only 45 percent of the men drivers hospitalized or killed were injured in collisions with cars and light trucks; most of the men drivers were hurt in one-car crashes (20 percent of the total in rollovers, 35 percent in nonrollovers). One reason for these differences in the pattern of injury is that men and women drivers tend to be involved in different types of crashes, as described in chapter 2. Men drivers are involved in one-car crashes more often than women drivers. In our analysis, 69 percent of the crash involvements of men drivers were in collisions with cars and light trucks, with about 31 percent in one-car crashes. In contrast, about 79 percent of the crash involvements of women drivers were in collisions with cars and light trucks, with only about 21 percent in one-car crashes. However, another reason is that women drivers are much more likely than men drivers to be hospitalized or killed in collisions with cars and light trucks. That is, women drivers are especially likely to be hurt in the type of crash that they are also particularly likely to experience. In statistically equivalent crashes, women drivers are 52 percent more likely than men drivers to be hospitalized or killed in collisions with other cars or light trucks, but injury risks for women drivers are roughly the same as those for men drivers in one-car crashes—4 percent higher in one-car rollovers and 6 percent lower in other one-car crashes. (See tables I.3-1.5.) Automobile Weight. In our data set, women drove lighter and smaller cars than men. The automobiles women drove had an average curb weight of 2,615 pounds and a mean wheelbase of 100.7 inches; for men drivers, the figures were 2,715 pounds and 101.5 inches. We also found that the protective effect of increasing automobile weight was less evident for women drivers than for men drivers. Since increasing weight generally offers protection in a crash, the average automobile weight for drivers who were hospitalized or killed should be lower than the average weight for those who were not injured. This was true for men but not for women. The average curb weight of the cars driven by men who were hospitalized or killed was 2,626 pounds, compared with a greater average curb weight of 2,719 pounds for men who were not injured. In contrast, the average automobile curb weight for women drivers who were hospitalized or killed was 2,611 pounds, compared with an equivalent average curb weight of 2,615 pounds for women drivers who were not injured. Safety Belts. Each of the safety belt configurations that we examined (manual lap and shoulder belts, automatic and manual belts, and automatic belts only) significantly reduced the injury risk of both men and women drivers. However, we also uncovered evidence that, in this data set, safety belts were somewhat less effective for women drivers than for men drivers. Table 3.1 compares men and women automobile drivers hospitalized as the result of a crash by safety belt use. For all three types of crashes, the table separates the percentage of drivers who were hospitalized or killed from those not hospitalized as well as separating men and women in each group. Safety belt use did not differ by gender for drivers who were not hospitalized: about three quarters of both the men and women drivers in that group were belted. If safety belts offered equivalent protection to men and women drivers, the belt use percentages among hospitalized or killed drivers should reflect the same pattern—in this case, rough equivalence for men and women. However, the table shows that among drivers who were hospitalized or killed, women were more likely to have been wearing safety belts than men. In particular, injured women drivers were about 50 percent more likely to have been wearing manual lap and shoulder belts than were injured men (36 percent to 24 percent). Crash Type. The patterns of injury by crash type are very different for drivers 65 and older and for younger drivers. Figure 3.2 shows that, in our analysis, nearly four fifths of the drivers 65 or older who were hospitalized or killed were injured in collisions with cars or light trucks, while only about one fifth were injured in one-car crashes (and almost none were hurt in one-car rollovers—just 3 percent). Conversely, just over half of the drivers 16 to 64 who were hospitalized or killed were injured in collisions with cars or light trucks, while about 29 percent were hurt in one-car nonrollovers and 17 percent were in one-car rollovers. The primary reason for this difference between the age categories is that drivers in the two groups are involved in different types of crashes. Drivers younger than 65 are involved in collisions with cars and light trucks less often, and in one-car crashes more often, than are drivers 65 and older. In our analysis, 73 percent of the crash involvements of drivers 16 to 64 were in collisions with cars and light trucks, about 22 percent in one-car nonrollover crashes, and about 5 percent in one-car rollover crashes. In contrast, about 86 percent of the crash involvements of drivers 65 and older were collisions with cars and light trucks, with only about 11 percent one-car nonrollover crashes and just 3 percent one-car rollovers. Older drivers are much more likely to be hurt in crashes than younger drivers in almost all circumstances. For one-car nonrollover crashes, we found that, in statistically equivalent crashes, drivers 65 and older were hospitalized or killed about 6.6 times more often than the youngest drivers, those 16 to 24. Similarly, for collisions with cars and light trucks, drivers 65 and older had a probability of injury more than four times as great as drivers 16 to 24. Automobile Weight. Drivers 65 and older operated heavier and larger cars than younger drivers. The automobiles of drivers 65 and older had an average curb weight of 2,874 pounds and a mean wheelbase of 104.9 inches. The automobiles of drivers 16 to 64 had an average curb weight of 2,649 pounds and a mean wheelbase of 100.8 inches. We also found that the protective effect of increasing automobile weight was only slightly less strong for drivers 65 and older than for younger drivers. Thus, the average curb weight of the cars driven by those 16 to 64 who were hospitalized or killed was 2,590 pounds, compared with a larger average curb weight of 2,652 pounds for those who were not hospitalized. The average automobile curb weight for drivers 65 and older who were hospitalized or killed was 2,836 pounds, compared with an average curb weight of 2,878 pounds for drivers who were not hospitalized. Safety Belts. Although the safety belt use figures in the NASS data set may be inflated, as we discussed earlier, we found that safety belts reduced the risk of injury for drivers in both age categories. We also found that the effectiveness of safety belts was roughly equivalent for drivers 16 to 64 and for drivers 65 and older in this data set. For example, table 3.2 shows the percentage of belted drivers separately for those hospitalized or killed and for those not hospitalized, as well as separating these categories by age. The table shows that drivers 65 and older used safety belts more often than drivers 16 to 64 and that this pattern holds both among those who were hospitalized or killed and among those who were not hospitalized. Thus, while older drivers use safety belts more frequently, this difference from younger drivers is found across the board, rather than only among the hospitalized and killed, as it was for the comparison between women drivers and men drivers. Taken as a whole, the evidence indicates that the “inherent frailty” hypothesis does not accurately describe the injury experience of women drivers in automobile crashes but is consistent with that of older drivers. This is because the relative injury risk of women drivers compared with men drivers differs as a function of crash type, automobile size, and safety belt use, while the relative injury risk of drivers 65 and older compared with younger drivers is largely unaffected by those three factors. Women drivers are more likely than men drivers to be hospitalized or killed in collisions with cars and light trucks but not in one-car crashes, and women drivers may be protected less well by heavier cars and by safety belts than are men drivers. In contrast, drivers 65 and older have a greater risk of hospitalization or death than younger drivers in one-car as well as multivehicle crashes, and they are afforded roughly the same degree of protection as drivers 16 to 64 by greater automobile weight and safety belt use. The NASS data set did not allow us to pursue more specific explanations for differences stemming from gender and age. For example, men and women differ in many ways—on the average, women are shorter than men, weigh less than men, and have bones that are less strong than men’s, among other potentially relevant differences. It is difficult to identify the key difference that accounts for women’s greater injury risk. Our findings about the applicability of the inherent frailty hypothesis suggest that the concerns of women drivers are more likely to be ameliorated by automobile design changes than are those of older drivers. This means not that it is impossible to reduce the injury risk of drivers 65 and older but only that it may be difficult to close the gap between older and younger drivers. The implications of our findings for future automobile safety are discussed in chapter 5. Three other points are worthy of mention. First, it is not surprising that the injury risk in one-car rollover crashes is similar both for women and men drivers and for drivers older and younger than 65. One-car rollover crashes are very severe events, meaning that differences between individual drivers are likely to be overwhelmed by the magnitude of the crash. Further, few of the drivers in one-car rollover crashes were either women or 65 or older. Second, while our finding that safety belts may not protect women drivers as well as men drivers is far from definitive, other researchers examining data from other sources have also reported that the benefits of safety belts are not as great for women as they are for men. (See, for example, Hill, Mackay, and Morris, 1994; Mercier et al., 1993.) Third, the types of crashes experienced by drivers 65 and older reduce the protective influence of automobile weight for them. Not only are older drivers much more likely to have multivehicle than one-car crashes; also, those multivehicle collisions occur disproportionately in intersections and, therefore, disproportionately involve side impacts. (See Viano et al., 1990.) Automobile weight offers less protection in side-impact collisions than in frontal impacts. As we demonstrated in chapters 2 and 3, crash severity, crash type, automobile weight and wheelbase, safety belt use, and driver age and gender, taken separately, each significantly influences the probability of driver hospitalization or death. For this chapter, we also assessed the relative importance of these factors simultaneously to see which ones are the most important predictors of injury in a crash and which ones have relatively little influence. We found that crash severity is the most important predictor of driver hospitalization or death, followed by crash type, safety belt use, driver age and gender, and automobile weight. Crash severity refers to the speed of impact, while crash type refers to the number of vehicles in a crash, whether the car rolled over, and its points of impact. If information about only one of these several factors were available for predicting whether the driver would be seriously injured, having access to crash severity information would lead to the greatest number of accurate predictions. If crash severity information could not be obtained, information about the crash type would give the best chance of accurately predicting whether or not the driver would be injured. And so on down the list of factors. Table 4.1 documents this finding. It shows a statistical measure of the “explanatory power” of each factor. The table shows that the largest value for this measure is for crash severity, followed by crash type, and then the other factors in the order previously noted. The “explanatory power” of automobile weight is substantially less than that of all the other factors. Another way to illustrate the great importance of the crash severity and crash type factors is presented in figure 4.1. Each column in the figure shows the estimated increment in risk of injury associated with a change in the associated crash-related factor, combining the three types of crashes in our analysis. Thus, the “crash severity” bar in the figure shows that crashes involving a change in velocity of 23 mph have an estimated risk of driver injury 25 times as great as crashes with a change in velocity of only 6 mph. The bar for crash type shows our estimate that drivers involved in one-car rollover crashes are about nine times more likely to be hurt than drivers involved in collisions with cars and light trucks that are not head-on crashes. Similarly, figure 4.1 shows that drivers 65 and older are about 4.5 times more likely to be hospitalized or killed than drivers 16 to 24 and that unbelted drivers have an injury risk more than three times as great as drivers wearing manual lap and shoulder safety belts. Drivers of 2,000-pound automobiles have an estimated injury risk in a crash that is about 1.63 times (or 63 percent greater than) that of drivers of 3,600-pound cars. Finally, the estimated injury risk for women drivers is about 1.29 times (or 29 percent greater than) that of men drivers. Here we discuss the implications of our findings for future automobile safety. The first section below reviews the safety initiatives from NHTSA that have the greatest importance for automobile crashworthiness. The next section discusses ways to reduce the injury risk for particular categories of automobile drivers. The last section discusses the most effective uses of available safety technologies. It is important to keep two points in mind when considering alternative approaches to automobile crashworthiness. First, crashworthy automobiles must offer as much protection as possible for a broad matrix of crash types, crash speeds, and occupant characteristics that pose very different occupant protection problems. For example, we found that one-car crashes, particularly rollovers, are much more dangerous than collisions with cars and light trucks. We also found that men drivers and young drivers are disproportionately involved in one-car crashes, while women drivers and older drivers are more likely to be involved in collisions with cars and light trucks. Protecting young men in severe one-car crashes is very different from protecting women and older drivers in multivehicle collisions. Second, individual safety features often affect only one portion of the matrix of crash types and occupant characteristics. For example, air bags clearly help protect occupants in frontal collisions, but they do not contribute to occupant safety in side-impact collisions or rollover crashes. Starting with the 1990 model year, all automobiles sold in the United States have had to demonstrate driver and right-front-seat passenger safety with passive restraints in a full-frontal crash at 30 mph into a rigid barrier. “Passive restraint” means without the use of any safety device requiring actions by the driver or passenger, such as manual safety belts.In model year 1987, the first year of the phase-in period for this regulation, all the automobiles NHTSA tested met this requirement with automatic safety belts. By 1993, almost all the tested cars fulfilled the passive restraint requirement with air bags rather than automatic belts alone, although many of the cars with air bags also had automatic safety belts. NHTSA has announced major changes in this regulation. All cars manufactured in September 1997 or later will be required to have both air bags and manual lap and shoulder safety belts for both drivers and right-front-seat passengers. Very importantly, the revised regulation prohibits automatic safety belts—not just for use in the compliance tests but as safety equipment. All cars will have to be equipped with manual safety belts. Beginning with the 1994 model year, NHTSA began phasing in a requirement for automobile occupant protection in side impacts. By model year 1997, all automobiles will have to meet safety standards in crash tests simulating the impact of a 3,000-pound vehicle hitting the target car in a side-impact collision at 33.5 mph. Unlike the frontal impact crash tests, active restraint systems, such as manual safety belts, must be used in these tests. NHTSA is also undertaking a variety of efforts to deal with particular mechanisms of occupant injury rather than points of contact on the automobile. For example, to reduce head injuries, NHTSA is developing a regulation that would require energy-absorbing padding in the areas of automobile interiors that occupants’ heads frequently strike in side-impact collisions. Also, NHTSA is studying ways to further reduce injuries in rollover crashes, primarily by reducing the risk of ejection, by improving door latches and increasing the strength of automobile windows other than windshields, as well as by considering tougher roof crush standards. Other NHTSA activities are concerned with particular types of automobile occupants, especially children and elderly persons. It is important to note that NHTSA is seeking ways to improve protection for elderly drivers, although a major focus of NHTSA’s work involves programs to improve their driving skills or otherwise reduce their likelihood of crash involvement. (See Transportation Research Board, 1992, and NHTSA, 1993a; see also NHTSA 1992b for its activities priority plan through 1994.) Automobile manufacturers understand that different segments of the consumer market for automobiles prefer different types of cars. For example, young men are likely to prefer sports cars over station wagons, and older drivers disproportionately prefer large cars over smaller ones. In other words, in the marketplace for automobiles, one size does not fit all. Similarly, one size does not fit all when it comes to automobile safety: the crashworthiness problems of different types of drivers, and of drivers involved in different types of crashes, require a variety of different solutions. Here, we look at the differential safety concerns of segments of the safety “marketplace” that are defined by safety belt use and driver age and gender. Drivers involved in traffic crashes, on the whole, operate their vehicles in a riskier manner than drivers who are not involved in crashes. For example, the rate of safety belt use for drivers involved in crashes is less than the use rate for the general driving population. Estimates of the degree to which drivers who do not wear safety belts are overinvolved in roadway crashes vary considerably. For example, NHTSA (1992a) estimated that unbelted drivers experience potentially fatal crashes 2.2 times more than belted drivers, while Hunter et al. (1993) found that unbelted drivers had a crash involvement rate 35 percent higher than belt users. Unbelted and belted drivers have very different injury experiences in a crash. Unbelted drivers are more likely to suffer severe injuries, and their injuries are more likely to result from contact with the steering wheel or windshield (Danner, Langieder, and Hummel, 1987; Lestina et al., 1991). These differences are explained by the mechanisms of safety belt effectiveness. Safety belts tie the occupant to the car, helping the occupant decelerate over a relatively long period. In addition, by restricting movement, safety belts reduce the chances of the wearer’s striking the interior of the vehicle and help make his or her course of motion within the car more predictable. In contrast, unbelted occupants keep moving within the automobile in the moments after collision, the direction of their movement within the vehicle is relatively unpredictable, and it is likely either that their rapid motion will be abruptly stopped by contact with a rigid surface within the vehicle or that they will be ejected from it. Therefore, optimally safe vehicle interiors are conceptually dissimilar for belted and unbelted occupants (Mackay, 1993). For belted occupants, the more interior space the better, as increasing the space reduces the odds of contact with interior surfaces. Conversely, for unbelted occupants, the goal is to restrict movement and provide a soft place to land, so heavily padded interiors that minimize interior space are preferred. How can crash protection be improved for unbelted and belted drivers? For unbelted drivers, the obvious answer is to put them in safety belts. In practical terms, the best way to do this is to increase the number of automobiles with automatic safety belts. As NHTSA (1992a) and Williams et al. (1992) have reported, automobiles equipped with automatic safety belts have much higher belt usage rates than those with manual belts. While experimental vehicles have been designed with substantial protection for unbelted occupants, we do not believe that any combination of interior padding, air bags, and other passive restraint systems will be able to rival the effectiveness of safety belts in production automobiles for the foreseeable future. One reason for this is that, as noted above, designing an optimally safe car for unrestrained drivers may require abandoning safety belts as the centerpiece of occupant protection strategies. And safety belts are extraordinarily effective; alone, they are much more effective at reducing serious injuries than are air bags alone. For belted drivers, the prospects for dramatic improvements in crash protection are less obvious. On the one hand, promising efforts are under way to reduce much of the residual risk of injury confronting belted drivers. These include improvements in safety belt technology, the greater availability of air bags, and NHTSA’s efforts to improve occupant protection in side impacts. On the other hand, the great success of recent occupant protection efforts means that further crashworthiness improvements are harder to achieve, primarily because the dwindling proportion of crashes that still cause serious injury and death to belted occupants are exceptionally severe events. For example, Mackay et al. (1992), reviewing a sample of crashes involving the death of restrained front-seat occupants in Britain, found that the deaths occurred in extremely severe crashes. Fifty percent of the deaths in frontal crashes were in collisions with large trucks, and 86 percent involved passenger compartments crushed so severely as to eliminate the space occupied by the fatally injured person before the crash. Similarly, Green et al. (1994) reported that most of the fatalities of restrained occupants that they examined involved severe intrusion into the passenger compartment and multiple injuries so severe that 90 percent of the victims died within an hour of the crash. The “market segments” for automobile safety defined by driver age and gender require very different strategies for reducing fatalities. For men drivers and younger drivers, the problem is crash involvement, not crashworthiness. As we demonstrated in chapter 2, compared to women and older drivers, not only are men drivers and younger drivers involved in more automobile crashes but also the crashes they are particularly likely to be involved in have comparatively severe consequences—that is, single-car crashes have much higher driver injury rates than multivehicle crashes. However, as we saw in chapter 3, men drivers and younger drivers are significantly less likely to be hurt in a crash than women and older drivers. That is, men and younger drivers benefit from a degree of occupant protection that is not available to women and older drivers (we will discuss some of the reasons later). In summary, the surest way to improve the safety of men drivers and younger drivers is to attempt to reduce their crash involvement rates, particularly their rates of involvement in single-car crashes. The situation is exactly the reverse for women and older drivers. The problem for them is crashworthiness, not crash involvement. Compared to men and younger drivers, women and older drivers are involved in fewer automobile crashes, and the crashes they are involved in are, on the average, less severe, since they are less likely to be involved in single-car crashes than in multivehicle collisions. However, once a crash has occurred, women and, especially, older drivers are more likely to be hospitalized or killed. In our judgment, improving the crash protection offered by automobiles to women and older drivers so that it approaches the level enjoyed by men and younger drivers offers the greatest chance for reducing roadway injuries for them. In the absence of compelling evidence for the inherent physical frailty of women compared to men, we are optimistic that crashworthiness for women can be substantially improved. In contrast, the evidence we have reviewed indicates that older drivers are, in fact, more fragile than young drivers. Nonetheless, we believe that older drivers can be afforded better protection by automobiles than they now receive (see subsequent discussion and Mackay, 1988). It is important that occupant protection for women drivers and older drivers be improved without compromising the crash protection of men drivers and younger drivers; design changes that merely shift injury risk from one group of drivers to another will not improve traffic safety in the aggregate. One possible reason for the relatively high degree of crash protection enjoyed by men drivers and younger drivers is that efforts at improving automobile crashworthiness have concentrated on the crash types and occupant characteristics most often experienced by them. Current safety regulations and automobile safety designs emphasize protection in high-speed frontal collisions, and men drivers and younger drivers are more likely to be in single-car crashes, which disproportionately involve frontal impacts. The automobile crash tests NHTSA currently requires for all cars include full-frontal crashes into a rigid barrier at 30 mph (although the introduction of a requirement for side-impact tests is under way). Air bags reduce the risk of injury in frontal impacts only, not in side impacts. Similarly, safety belts are more effective in frontal than in side impacts (for example, Evans, 1990), and because of this, safety belts have a somewhat greater benefit in single-car crashes than in collisions with cars and light trucks. A second possible reason for the crashworthiness deficit of women drivers compared with men drivers is that current NHTSA regulations require the use of only one size of crash test dummy—a dummy representing the 50th percentile of the male population, or 5 feet 9 inches tall, weighing 165 pounds. Maximizing the safety of persons with these characteristics may, in a relative sense, compromise the safety of others. Another possible explanation for the greater injury risk for women drivers is that, on the average, women are shorter and lighter than men. Automobiles designed to accommodate taller and heavier men drivers may not accommodate women as well. For example, the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (1993) recommends that drivers sit back as far as possible from the steering wheel and dashboard in order to minimize the risk of hitting those structures in a crash. Shorter drivers obviously cannot sit as far back as taller drivers if they hope to reach the accelerator and brake pedals, and this may expose them to more risk. All safety belts are not equally effective. In particular, many cars on the market today have safety belts with automatic pretensioners or web locking devices that substantially improve their effectiveness (IIHS, 1993). Pretensioners work by reducing the amount of slack in the belts or by tightening them in a crash a fraction of a second sooner. They cause the belted occupant to begin decelerating sooner in a crash, thereby increasing the total deceleration period. In addition, they increase the chances that the occupant’s forward motion will be stopped before he or she contacts the interior of the automobile. To give an idea of the magnitude of the safety increment available from belts with these features, Viano (1988) compared the performance of several restraint mechanisms in frontal crash tests. Depending on the outcome measure used, lap and shoulder belts with pretensioners had injury scores about 15 to 40 percent below those of lap and shoulder belts without pretensioners. NHTSA has recently announced regulations that would implement the requirement in the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991 that all passenger cars and light trucks be equipped with air bags and lap and shoulder safety belts. Beginning with all cars manufactured in September 1997, both drivers and right-front-seat passengers will have both air bags and manual lap and shoulder safety belts; automatic safety belts are prohibited. We are concerned that NHTSA’s implementation of the requirement for air bags may not achieve the greatest degree of improvement in the aggregate safety of the population of automobile occupants. Automobile occupants who travel in cars with air bags and who wear manual lap and shoulder safety belts will be well protected. However, because safety belts alone offer much more protection than air bags alone, occupants of air bag-equipped cars who do not wear lap and shoulder safety belts will be less well protected than if they were traveling in cars with automatic safety belts. This is important because cars with automatic safety belts have higher safety belt usage rates than cars with manual belts, and individuals involved in serious automobile crashes have lower safety belt use rates than others. If many automobile occupants in serious crashes do not wear manual safety belts, the aggregate safety of automobile occupants under NHTSA’s proposal would be less than if, in addition to air bags, automatic safety belts were encouraged or required. To examine this question, we compared the average amount of occupant protection available to all automobile occupants under three different safety-belt-use scenarios based on a recent NHTSA report (NHTSA, 1992a). In that report, NHTSA noted that cars equipped with manual lap and shoulder belts had a belt usage rate of 56 percent in 1991, while cars equipped with automatic safety belts had usage rates ranging from 64 to 97 percent, depending on the type of automatic belt. If all cars had air bags and manual lap and shoulder belts and a belt usage rate of 56 percent, we estimate that fatality risk would fall 37.2 percent for the average automobile occupant compared with unprotected occupants. If all cars had air bags and automatic safety belts and a belt usage rate of 64 percent, we estimate that the average automobile occupant would have a 37.7-percent reduction in fatality risk. If all cars had air bags and automatic safety belts and a belt usage rate of 97 percent, we estimate that the total fatality risk reduction would be 46 percent. Thus, from the standpoint of maximizing the aggregate safety of all automobile occupants, the best proposal may be one that requires both air bags and automatic lap and shoulder safety belts. The magnitude of the fatality risk reduction arising from that configuration compared to NHTSA’s regulation requiring manual lap and shoulder safety belts depends on the difference between the usage rates of automatic and manual safety belts for automobile occupants involved in serious crashes. As our estimates show, if that difference is small, the automatic safety belt alternative offers only a very slight aggregate safety improvement. Conversely, if the usage rate difference is high, placing air bags and automatic lap and shoulder safety belts in all cars would substantially improve the safety of automobile occupants in the aggregate. DOT had two comments regarding the implications of our finding that, holding constant crash characteristics and automobile weight, women are more likely than men to suffer serious injury in a crash. The first is that NHTSA plans to conduct crash tests with test dummies of different sizes rather than only the standard dummy that represents a 50th percentile man driver. The second is that NHTSA has recently made final a rule requiring improvements in the adjustability of safety belts that may increase the percentage of vehicle occupants using belts correctly. We applaud both these developments. Nonetheless, in our opinion, there is no definitive evidence that either size differences or patterns of safety belt use fully account for the differences in injury rates between men and women. DOT also had two comments on our discussion of NHTSA’s implementation of the requirement for air bags. First, it contended that the usage figures for automatic safety belts that we used in our example are unrealistically high. More specifically, DOT stated that the usage rates for complete automatic belt systems are much less than the 97-percent scenario we described, since some drivers use only one component but not the other (for example, using the shoulder belt but not the lap belt) and other drivers disconnect the automatic belt system entirely. Second, DOT disagreed with our conclusion that manual and automatic safety belts provide “a roughly equivalent degree of protection.” For the first point, we understand that it is extremely difficult to accurately measure safety belt use, especially the use of particular safety belt components (see chapter 2). However, NHTSA (1992a) has concluded that automatic safety belts are used more often than manual belts, and our 97-percent usage rate scenario was based on a NHTSA report, not on our own analysis. Further, our findings would not differ even if automatic safety belts had usage rates much less than 97 percent; thus, we found that the scenario with a 64-percent usage rate for automatic belts (NHTSA’s lowest estimate) still provided slightly more total protection than the other scenario we considered, manual belts with a 56-percent usage rate. For the second point, our conclusion that manual and automatic safety belts provide approximately equivalent protection is based on NHTSA’s work, not on our own analyses of automobile crash data. For example, NHTSA (1993d, p.II-13) estimated that, when used in a crash, manual lap and shoulder safety belts reduce fatality risk by 45 percent and automatic three-point belts reduce fatality risk by 42.5 percent. Similarly, NHTSA earlier reported that it was unable to find any statistically significant differences between several different configurations of manual and automatic safety belts (NHTSA, 1992a, p.66). Most importantly, neither of DOT’s comments about our discussion of NHTSA’s implementation of the requirement for air bags addressed our main point—that drivers involved in serious crashes use safety belts much less than the general driving population. Our discussion is aimed at improving crash protection for drivers who have the greatest risk of involvement in serious crashes. A comprehensive evaluation of the best ways to increase safety belt use for those drivers is beyond the scope of this report. However, as our analysis demonstrates, NHTSA’s decision to prohibit automatic safety belts may not achieve the best result from that perspective. At a minimum, NHTSA needs to continue to emphasize in its public education efforts the importance of wearing safety belts even in cars equipped with air bags.","Pursuant to a congressional request, GAO reviewed highway safety, focusing on: (1) the most important predictors of injury in an automobile crash; (2) how the risk of injury in a crash is affected by the severity and type of crash, automobile size, safety belts and airbags, and the occupants' age and gender; and (3) areas for further reducing automobile occupants' crash injury risks. GAO found that: (1) the most important determinants of driver injury in car crashes are speed at impact, the type of crash, safety belt use, driver age and gender, and automobile weight and size; (2) injury is more likely in high-speed crashes, one car crashes, frontal crashes, and rollovers; (3) occupants of heavier and larger cars are less likely to be injured, but those cars pose a greater danger to persons in multivehicle crashes; (4) heavier cars offer more protection in one-car nonrollover and multivehicle crashes, but occupants of these cars are subject to more injury in rollovers than are occupants of lighter cars; (5) although safety belts reduce injury risks overall, they are most effective in rollovers, single car crashes, and frontal crashes; (6) air bags are only effective in frontal crashes and are less effective than safety belts alone; (7) although they are involved in fewer crashes overall, female and older drivers are more often injured than male and younger drivers are in similar crashes; (8) safety belts are not as effective for women as they are for men; (9) female and older drivers are involved in more multivehicle crashes and male and younger drivers are involved in more single car crashes; (10) older drivers tend to be involved in more side impact crashes; and (11) the government and manufacturers are working to improve automobile safety for each category of driver.",govreport
"User financing—in the form of user fees, user charges, or excise taxes on certain products—is one approach to financing federal programs or activities. User fees assign part or all of the costs of these programs and activities—the cost of providing a benefit that is above and beyond what is normally available to the general public—to readily identifiable users of those programs and activities. Because user fees represent a charge for a service or benefit received from a government program, payers may expect a tight link between their payments and the cost of providing services and have expectations about the quality of the related service. For the purposes of this guide we use the term user fees to include user fees as well as excise taxes with a “user pays” element. Examples include those imposed on motor fuels, tires, and heavy vehicles that accrue to the Highway Trust Fund, from which Congress appropriates funds for federal highway and transit programs. Similarly, Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) activities are funded in part by excise taxes assessed on airline tickets, aviation fuel, and certain cargo. A highway toll may also be considered a user fee because it is related to the specific use of a particular section of highway. The boundaries between fees and taxes are not always clear and the tradeoffs among design elements presented in this guide can be relevant to both. In general, a user fee is related to some voluntary transaction or request for government goods or services above and beyond what is normally available to the public, such as a request that a public agency permit an applicant to practice law or medicine or construct a house or run a broadcast station. Taxes, on the other hand, arise from the government’s sovereign power to raise revenue and need not be related to any specific benefit, and payment is not optional; when Congress imposes taxes, it need not consider benefits bestowed by the government on an individual but may base taxation solely on an individual’s ability to pay. The Supreme Court has ruled that a tax is “an enforced contribution to provide for the support of government.” The legal distinction between a “fee” and a “tax” can be complicated and depends largely on the context of the particular assessment. Whether a particular assessment is statutorily referred to as a tax or a fee is never legally determinative. Instead, federal courts will examine the structure and the context of the assessment’s application. Fees vary in the degree to which they can be considered truly voluntary because the availability of reasonable substitutes varies. For example, to enter certain national parks, one must pay an entrance fee. The fee is voluntary to the extent that there are alternatives to national parks for outdoor recreation, for example, state, county, or private parks and recreation facilities. In contrast, people who want to operate radio stations have no similarly close alternative and must obtain a license from the Federal Communications Commission and pay a fee for that license. Agencies derive their authority to charge fees either from the Independent Offices Appropriation Act of 1952 (IOAA) or from specific statutory authority. IOAA provides broad authority to assess user fees or charges on identifiable beneficiaries by administrative regulation. User fees assessed under IOAA authority must be (1) fair and (2) based on costs to the government, the value of the service or thing to the recipient, public policy or interest serviced, and other relevant facts. Fees collected under this authority are deposited in the general fund of the U.S. Treasury and are generally not available to the agency or the activity generating the fees. Unless otherwise authorized by law, IOAA requires that agency regulations establishing a user fee are subject to policies prescribed by the President. OMB provides such guidance to executive branch agencies under this authority through Circular No. A-25. The Circular establishes federal guidelines regarding user fees assessed under the authority of IOAA and other statutes, including the scope and types of activities subject to user fees and the basis upon which the fees are set. It also provides guidance for executive branch agency implementation of fees and the disposition of collections. In many instances, Congress has provided specific authority to federal agencies to assess user fees—in agency authorizing or appropriations legislation, for example. Legislation authorizing a user fee may enact a specified rate or amount to be assessed or may stipulate how the fee is to be calculated, such as a formula; the method and timing of collection; and the authorized uses of the fee collections, which may be broadly or narrowly defined. The amount of a fee may be set to partially or fully recover costs or may be set according to some other basis (e.g., market value). Specific authorizing statutes may even grant the agency broad discretion to set and revise fee rates without Congressional approval—that is, solely through the regulatory process—based on various factors. Specific user fee statutes should be construed consistent with IOAA and OMB Circular No. A-25 to the extent possible as part of an overall statutory scheme. Of the four components of implementing a user fee, setting the rate of the fee is perhaps the most challenging because determining the cost of the service is often quite complex and requires consideration of a range of issues (see fig. 1). In theory, the extent to which a program is funded by user fees should generally be guided by who primarily benefits from the program, though, as we discuss later, the extent to which a program benefits users or the general public is not usually clear cut. This is known as the beneficiary- pays principle. Under this principle, if a program primarily benefits the general public (e.g., national defense), it should be supported by general revenue, not user fees; if a program primarily benefits identifiable users, such as customers of the U.S. Postal Service, it should be funded by fees; and if a program benefits both the general public and users, it should be funded in part by fees and in part by general revenues. As shown in figure 2, the beneficiary-pays principle can promote equity by assigning costs to those who both use and benefit from the services. First, as shown on the left side of figure 2, the extent to which a program provides benefits to the general public versus users should guide the proportion of total program costs that are paid for by general revenues versus user fees. Second, as shown on the right side of the illustration, the cost of providing the benefits to each user should be determined and assigned through user fees. Figure 3 depicts selected federal programs funded according to this principle. Secondary beneficiaries of a program generally are not considered in this examination. For example, consumers of new prescription drugs are secondary beneficiaries of prescription drug reviews, which provide a primary benefit to the drug sponsors. Similarly, fees should be charged to the direct user, even if that payer then passes the cost of the fee on to others. The entities that bear the burden of a fee—what economists call the incidence of the fee—are not necessarily those who legally must pay the fee. Fees may be passed along to others through price changes, as the fee may change the price of one good relative to another and therefore affect the allocation of resources. How prices change—and therefore the incidence of the fee—depends on (1) how responsive market supply and demand are to price changes (price elasticity) and (2) market conditions that affect an entity’s ability to control prices. The ability of payers to pass along the fee does not necessarily change the economic efficiency effects of the fee but can affect its perceived equity and the transparency of the fee. User fees set under the beneficiary-pays principle can also enhance economic efficiency by ensuring that resources are allocated to the most highly valued use, as users make adjustments to their consumption of the service based on their costs and benefits. For example, setting a Food and Drug Administration (FDA) fee for new prescription drug applications too high could discourage the development of new drugs. On the other hand, setting the fee too low induces overuse of agency resources and services. To the extent a fee is voluntary, user fees based on a program or service’s total costs may also act as a market test and can help ensure that the benefits of the program are at least as great as its costs. Under the beneficiary-pays principle, the government may wish to charge some users a lower fee or no fee to encourage certain behaviors that provide a public benefit, such as advancing a public policy goal (e.g., promoting free trade). For example: Potential profits from the development of “orphan” drugs—those that treat rare diseases—are limited by the small size of their market, and therefore drug companies may be reluctant to invest in them; such drugs are exempt from the FDA prescription drug application fee to encourage their development. Imports from certain least developed countries are exempt from CBP’s Merchandise Processing Fee (MPF), which both addresses their ability to pay and may help promote their economic development. DHS officials noted that in other cases MPF exemptions have been used as a tool to negotiate free trade agreements; an exemption may be extended as a concession for the reduction of import tariffs on certain U.S. goods. Low-income taxpayers are exempt from the $150 application fee for the Internal Revenue Service’s Offer in Compromise (OIC) program—a program for taxpayers unable to fully pay their tax liabilities—to make the program more accessible and encourage participation. Although user fees can promote one facet of equity—the beneficiary-pays principle—they may run contrary to another facet—the ability-to-pay principle. To the extent that user fees are a substitute for funding through general tax revenues, they may be less progressive than taxes and therefore shift additional burden on those less able to pay. Fees (or taxes) that are proportionally more burdensome for low-income than high- income individuals are said to be regressive. To address this concern, the design of a fee may consider the ability of a user to pay, for example, by exempting low-income users or scaling fees by some measure of ability to pay. In certain cases user fees may not be the most equitable, efficient option for funding a program. Examples include fees for government programs intended to provide a benefit based on need or merit, such as the Department of Housing and Urban Development’s Section 8 housing voucher program (which assists low-income families, including the elderly and the disabled); competing sectors within an industry (e.g., modes of transportation) if the other sectors are not subject to similar fees; and new industries that face high initial costs and may need government support until they can become self-sustaining. Abrupt imposition of new or substantially increased user fees could have unintended consequences. For example, in May 2007, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) published a new fee schedule that raised fees effective July 2007 for immigrant and naturalization benefit applications by an average of 88 percent. Large numbers of applicants filed for benefits before the increase took effect, which contributed to a surge that exacerbated USCIS’s backlog of applications. In cases like this, transitional measures such as grandfather clauses or phasing in increases might help address concerns about the adverse effects of the abrupt imposition of a fee, while implementing the beneficiary-pays principle gradually. However, as is the case with exemptions, the benefits of transitional measures must be balanced with the likelihood of reduced efficiency and equity gains and increased administrative costs. Furthermore, delaying a fee increase may also have adverse effects on an agency’s operations. In some cases, new or increased user fees may also cause decreases in the value of privately owned assets. We have previously reported on how user fees can result in such capital losses, as well as ways of determining when, how much, and to whom compensation for these losses should be paid. Although the beneficiary-pays principle is a useful guideline for assigning costs, determining a program’s beneficiaries and the extent to which a program benefits users, the general public, or both is not usually clear cut. For example, in prior work we found that National Park Service (NPS) staff reported that they did not want to raise federal grazing fees assessed on ranchers, even though these fees were lower than fees charged by other government agencies and private landowners, in part because grazing not only benefits ranchers but also benefits parks—for example, by controlling vegetation. In another example, USDA food safety inspections benefit the meat and poultry industries as well as the general public: inspections improve consumer confidence in the safety of those food products and the companies can advertise their products as USDA inspected, which may enhance the perceived quality. The inspections also benefit the general public by preventing the spread of communicable diseases carried by meat and poultry products, but it is difficult to quantify that public health benefit and consequently the extent to which the program should be covered by user fees versus general revenues. Fees can be practical, equitable, and efficient only when the users can be identified and charged for the service or program. Sometimes, however, it may be difficult to identify specific users or to collect fees from them, making it difficult to follow the beneficiary-pays principle. NPS, which can identify and verify some users, also collects fees from air tour operators that fly over certain national park units. However, in prior work we found that because NPS could not verify air tour activity over the parks, it relied on operators to voluntarily report their air tours and pay the required fees. Some tour operators paid and some did not, resulting in inequities and less-than-owed fee collections. Fee collections should be sufficient to cover the intended portion of program costs over time. Although the costs of any particular program may rise or fall, there is a general concern that fees may not keep pace with increases in costs because of factors such as inflation. For example, in recent testimony we noted that revenues to support federal highway and transit funding are eroding in part because the federal motor fuel tax, which is set at the fixed amount of 18.4 cents per gallon, has not been increased since 1993. Therefore, the purchasing power of fuel tax revenues has eroded. To address these concerns, OMB Circular No. A-25 directs agencies to set fees as percentages of some appropriate base rather than fixed dollar amounts whenever possible. However, fees set at a percentage rate of some value (the basis) will not remain aligned with program costs if the value of the basis does not rise and fall in line with changes in the program costs. For example, in recent years the Harbor Maintenance Fee (HMF), which is assessed at a rate of 0.125 percent of the value of commercial cargo, has resulted in substantially higher collections than spending because the growth in the volume and value of commercial cargo has exceeded increases in harbor maintenance spending. As a result, HMF collections exceeded expenditures by over $506 million in fiscal year 2007. Thus, regardless of whether a fee is set at a flat dollar amount or a percentage rate, regular reviews and updates of the fee are necessary to ensure that the fee remains aligned with program costs (see final section of this guide, “Reviewing User Fees: Providing Information on Costs and Program Activities and Facilitating Stakeholder Support”). On the other hand, fee payers and other stakeholders may be concerned that, over time, the portion of program costs covered by general revenues will decline. This concern may be well founded; in prior work on fee- reliant agencies, we found that increased user fee collections sometimes appeared to have replaced appropriated funds. This substitution can be a particular concern when new or increased fees are assessed to augment total funding for a service or program. For example, part of the rationale for FDA’s Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) fees was to increase FDA resources for—thereby decreasing the processing time of—new drug applications. To assuage fee payers’ concerns that fees might not be used to increase the level of an existing service—but instead simply be used as a substitute for funding from general revenues—a fee statute may provide a kind of maintenance of effort (MOE) requirement in terms of general revenues funding. For example, in any year, FDA may only collect and spend PDUFA fees when Congress has appropriated from general revenues a certain amount specifically for FDA new drug application reviews. Such provisions, however, can have unintended consequences. In prior work we reported that according to FDA officials the spending baseline for the drug review program reduced available resources for other activities, such as reviewing over-the-counter and generic products and inspecting medical product manufacturing facilities. Increased reliance on fees as a source of funding may lead to a misalignment between the beneficiaries of a program and the sources of funding for the program and can have significant implications for agencies. Assigning costs requires (1) determining how much a program costs and (2) determining how to assign program costs among different users. As the beneficiary-pays principle is useful in guiding decisions about how program costs are divided between the general public and users, it can also guide how program costs are assigned among users. Basing fees on the cost of providing the program or service from which a user benefits enhances equity, as measured by the beneficiary-pays principle, as each user pays for the cost of services actually used. As discussed above, fees set following the beneficiary-pays principle also generally promote economic efficiency, as users take into account the “price” of a service when deciding how much of the service to consume. To set fees so that total collections cover the intended share of program costs, a reliable accounting of total program cost is important. To obtain such an accounting, it is necessary to determine which activities and costs should be included and which should not. Unless the authorizing legislation specifies costs that should be included or excluded, agencies should follow OMB guidance. OMB Circulars No. A-25 and No. A-11 instruct agencies to include all direct and indirect costs when determining full cost, including but not limited to personnel costs, including salaries and benefits such as medical insurance and retirement; physical overhead; consulting; material and supply costs; utilities; insurance; travel; rents or imputed rents on land, buildings, and equipment; management and supervisory costs; costs of collecting and enforcing fees; research; establishment of standards and regulation; and imputed costs. In prior work we found inconsistent implementation of this guidance. Some fees designed to cover the full cost of a program include all direct and indirect costs, but others do not. The power marketing administrations, for example, include all direct and indirect costs—including the cost of employee retirement benefits paid by the Office of Personnel Management—when setting their electricity rates. On the other hand, in recent work, we found that USDA’s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) did not include certain indirect and imputed costs when calculating the Agricultural Quarantine Inspection (AQI) fee rate. Fees should also be set and adjusted to cover the intended share of costs over time, which means agencies must project and consider future program costs. For example, in 2006 USDA’s Food Safety and Inspection Service set fee rates through fiscal year 2008 for its meat, poultry, and egg products overtime inspection services. The fee rates for each year included adjustments for inflation and employee pay raises, so that future fee collections were projected to grow with program costs. When more than one agency implements—and therefore incurs costs related to—a fee program, those agencies should work together to agree on a method for estimating future costs and collections. APHIS and CBP, for example, used different forecasting assumptions related to the AQI fees. In response to our recent work, the agencies now use common assumptions. Whether fee rates will be set using average cost or marginal cost is also an important consideration when setting fees. Setting fees at a rate equal to the marginal cost of providing the service or product to the user maximizes economic efficiency. In part because it is often difficult to measure marginal cost, fee rates are sometimes set based on average cost. The AQI fees are intended to cover total program costs; to set these fees, APHIS projects program costs for different inspection types (e.g., air passenger, commercial aircraft, and commercial vessels) and divides each by the total projected number of each type of payer. That is, each airline pays the same fee per arrival to cover the costs related to inspecting aircraft. When marginal costs are measurable but are low relative to the fixed costs of the program, setting the fee at marginal cost will lead to collections less than total costs. In these cases, users may be charged more than marginal costs or the program may be funded in part through general revenues. One option is to create a two-part fee consisting of (1) a flat fee to cover fixed costs and (2) a usage-based fee to cover marginal costs. For example, the marginal cost of providing electricity (i.e., operating power plants and maintaining transmission lines) is small compared with the costs of building power plants and transmission lines; thus, electricity consumers could be charged a flat monthly charge plus a charge that would vary based on their consumption. If a fee is to recover the costs associated with an agency program or service or some portion thereof, it is critical that agencies record, accumulate, and analyze timely and reliable data relating to those costs, consistent with applicable accounting standards. Many agencies, however, lack reliable cost data. For example, we previously reported that DHS’s U.S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement lacked adequate cost data to determine the portion of costs related to international air passenger immigration inspections, a fee-funded activity. Because generating and maintaining reliable cost data can be expensive, agencies must consider the costs of implementing, maintaining, and using financial management systems when determining the level of cost detail they need. Recognizing this, OMB Circular No. A-25 notes that program cost should be determined or estimated from the best available records of the agency and that new cost accounting systems need not be established solely for this purpose. Still, unreliable cost information can skew fee-setting decisions, so management needs reliable cost information to ensure that user fees recover the intended share of costs. As such, each agency should determine the appropriate level of detail for its cost accounting processes and procedures. If the cost of providing a service varies for different types of users, the fee may vary (a user-specific fee) or be set at an average rate (a systemwide fee). All other things being equal, user-specific fees promote equity and economic efficiency because the amount of the fee is closely aligned with the cost of the service. Systemwide fees may be higher or lower than the actual cost of providing a service to certain types of users. As a result there may be cross-subsidies across users. For example, we recently reported that FAA’s current funding structure raises concerns about equity and efficiency because users pay more or less than the costs of the air traffic control services they receive and therefore may lack incentives to use the national airspace system as efficiently as possible. Because user- specific fees require agencies to track the costs of providing service to different users, these fees are often more costly to administer than systemwide fees. Fees charged to vessel operators for overtime immigration inspections are user specific. The fee is only assessed when the vessel operator or its agent requests an overtime inspection. The amount of the fee varies depending on the number and pay grade of the inspectors and the amount of time spent on the inspection. We recently reported that this structure increases the fee’s administrative costs. According to CBP estimates, the cost of processing and billing the fee was 26 percent of related collections in fiscal year 2007. In contrast, the commercial vessel AQI fee is a systemwide fee. Vessel owners/operators pay the $492 fee regardless of whether or not the ship is actually inspected by an agricultural specialist and regardless of the agricultural risk posed by the vessel. In managing these types of trade-offs between the benefits and drawbacks of user-specific versus systemwide fees, several factors may be important to consider. 1. The purpose of a program: Systemwide fees may promote a policy goal such as helping to support national systems. For example, despite variation in the amount of maintenance dredging needed at different ports, the HMF is imposed uniformly at all ports at which shipments are subject to the fee in order to support a national port system. This means that users of naturally deep draft ports that require little dredging (e.g., Seattle) in effect subsidize users of shallower and river ports (e.g., New Orleans). A user-specific fee may be more desirable if the fee is seen as a way to support individual entities or locations or when maximizing economic efficiency outweighs the desire to support a national system through the imposition of a uniform fee. 2. The amount of the fee: If the fee is small relative to other costs that a user faces, it may be less important to have a user-specific fee with different rates. For example, several ships’ agents we spoke with noted that carriers rarely question federal vessel inspection fees, in part because the fees are such a small part of a commercial vessel’s overall expenses that they do not affect business decisions. 3. The amount of cost variation among users: If there are numerous different groups of users and a small cost variation among them, the efficiency gains of a user-specific fee may be overwhelmed by the added administrative costs. Conversely, if a program has a relatively small number of user groups and the cost of providing the service to those groups differs significantly, then user-specific fees might be both beneficial and feasible. Some fees include provisions for exemptions, waivers, and caps to promote certain policy goals and these provisions affect how program costs are allocated among users. As discussed previously, exemptions can promote one kind of equity by factoring the users’ ability to pay into the fee rate formula. However, as with systemwide fees, such provisions may also increase cross-subsidies between users. Exemptions and caps may also raise equity and efficiency concerns. For example, shipments into certain ports are not subject to the HMF, which may make these ports less costly to use than ports that are subject to the HMF. Shippers may have an incentive to use a port that might otherwise not be the most cost-efficient port to use, so the HMF as designed may create competitive advantages and disadvantages among ports. Stakeholders at HMF ports argued that the exemption is inequitable and can diminish a port’s ability to compete. For example, officials at the port of Boston told us that they believe that one importer moved its operations from Boston to the port of Quonset/Davisville in Rhode Island where shipments are not subject to the HMF to avoid paying the fee. Similarly, officials from ports located near international borders reported that the HMF disadvantages them relative to nearby foreign ports. Seattle port authority officials consider the HMF to be a “punitive assessment” because they said it decreases Seattle’s competitiveness against nearby Canadian ports (which do not charge the fee). The officials noted that the port of Vancouver actively promotes itself as not charging the HMF and said this partly explains why the port of Vancouver is growing faster than the Seattle port. Reliably accounting for the costs and benefits associated with such provisions is important in order to ensure that these provisions are achieving the intended results. In fully-fee-funded programs, if some users are exempt from paying fees, total fee collections cannot cover total program costs unless other users pay a higher fee to cover the costs of the exempted users. For example, commercial and private vessels are both subject to agricultural quarantine inspections, but private vessels are exempt from the AQI fees. In prior work we found that the costs of these private vessel inspections are included in the AQI fee charged to commercial vessels. Thus commercial vessels are paying for the cost of inspecting private vessels. An alternative to cross-subsidization would be to pay for the costs of providing services to exempt entities through general revenues. In this way the policy goal is attained and the general public, rather than other users, make up the cost of exempt users or discounted fees. Finally, like user-specific fees, fee exemptions and caps can increase administrative costs to the agency because the agency must carefully track when fees are due and from whom rather than simply charging everyone. Commercial vessel operators are generally assessed a $437 customs inspection fee when they arrive at port, but the fee is capped at $5,955 per calendar year. This is approximately 13.6 payments. This means that CBP has to calculate the point at which the vessel has reached the cap and is no longer subject to the fee. We recently reported that the cap increases CBP’s administrative costs and the potential for errors. This issue was particularly problematic in 2007 because a fee increase took effect on April 1, 2007, so vessels arriving before and after that date paid two different rates. Since the fee cap applies to payments received within a calendar year, it was even more difficult for CBP to calculate the total amount paid and determine if a vessel had reached the cap. The primary challenge in determining when and how to collect a fee is striking a balance between ensuring compliance and minimizing administrative costs (see fig. 4). Fees can be collected (1) at the point of sale before the service is provided, as airline passenger fees are paid when a ticket is purchased; (2) at the point of service, as when visitors enter a national park; or (3) after the service has been provided, for example when the agency bills the user for a service, as with overtime vessel inspections. Collecting the fee at the point of sale or point of service may decrease administrative costs since billing becomes unnecessary. However, point-of-sale/point-of- service collections do not always ensure low administrative costs since other practices can considerably complicate a point-of-sale/service collections system. For example, commercial vessel customs inspection fees are collected by inspectors at the time of inspection, usually in the form of a check. We recently reported that because these collections are not automated, they are administratively costly. When an agency collects fees on the spot rather than billing for services (e.g., the national parks system), the agency may have less work to do in tracking who has paid and who has not, thus reducing administrative tasks associated with ensuring compliance. However, internal controls for fee collections are still necessary. In some cases, collecting the fee at the point of service would present challenges that make doing so impractical. For example, if CBP collected fees from international air passengers at the airport, as is the practice in some other countries, inspection wait times for passengers would likely increase. For some fees, users are billed for services. This may create additional administrative costs since agency billings for services provided can add an extra step to the process. In some instances agencies are able to reduce their cost of collecting fees by using electronic payments or lockboxes or enabling users to prepay their fees, thus reducing payments from many to perhaps one time per year. Commercial trucks entering the United States, for example, are subject to a $5.25 AQI fee, payable upon arrival. However, the owner or operator of the truck can prepay the AQI fee annually and receive a truck transponder that covers all entries for the calendar year, which enables CBP to inspect the truck and then wave the driver through, rather than taking the time to collect the fee at each crossing. This prepayment reduces the administrative costs for both the agency, which may collect an annual payment instead of payments for every inspection, and the payer, who can make one payment per year rather than paying at each crossing. In some cases, it makes sense for the agency to coordinate the collection or audit function with a third party. Specifically, when an entity or industry (e.g., shippers) is assessed multiple user fees there may be opportunities for one agency to collect on behalf of others. For example, HMF collections are used by the Corps for harbor operations and maintenance costs, but the fee is collected by CBP because CBP has the administrative structures in place to collect other fees and duties assessed on the value of imported goods. It is less costly for the government and payers of the fee for CBP to collect the fee as part of the formal entry process than it would be for the Corps or another entity to establish a new collections process. This cost saving occurs because CBP already values cargo for the assessment of duties so there is no duplication of effort. We recently reported that customs brokers with whom we spoke said that this system for collecting the HMF assessed on imported goods works well, is efficient, and imposes minimal administrative costs. It may also make sense for agencies to coordinate fee collections when multiple federal agencies administer similar programs. For example, the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) manages grazing programs operated on both BLM and Department of Energy lands. Similarly, consolidating the audit function of related fees within one agency or department can lessen the administrative costs of auditing them. For example, the audit function for the customs, immigration, and AQI user fee remittances by air carriers was consolidated under a memorandum of understanding between APHIS, the former U.S. Customs Service, and the former Immigration and Naturalization Service before the three related inspection functions were consolidated under CBP. In some instances, as when CBP collects the HMF on behalf of the Corps, the agency is compensated for its cost of collecting the fee. In some cases, a nonfederal entity such as a state government or private sector enterprise has an existing infrastructure that can collect the fees. Passenger inspection fees, for example, are collected by airlines and cruise lines along with ticket fares; the collections are then remitted to CBP. However, when a private party takes over the collection function, ensuring compliance may become more complicated, contributing to administrative costs. Agencies may use audits to monitor and enforce compliance with the requirement to remit fees. CBP audits airlines and cruise lines to ensure that they are collecting and remitting the inspection fees as required. There are a range of other tools that can encourage compliance in these situations, for example, bond requirements and rewards and penalties. However, we have previously reported that to be effective, rewards and penalties must meet specific criteria, that is, they must provide optimal incentives and must correspond with performance. Congress determines to what extent an agency may access (obligate and spend) fee collections. On the one hand, when the use of fee collections is not dedicated to the related program or agency, Congress has greater flexibility to make decisions about allocating resources and play an active oversight role. While some maintain that the merits of a program, rather than its ability to generate fees, should influence federal funding decisions, dedicating fee collections to the program that generated the fee and giving the agency authority to obligate and expend the fees readily and decide how the collections will be used enhance the agency’s flexibility and ability to respond quickly to changing conditions. Some have suggested that agencies will have less motivation to collect and users to pay if the fees are not credited to the activity that generated the fee. The extent to which this is the case is unclear. Further, this may be dealt with by engaging stakeholders—both in and out of government—to help improve their understanding of the purpose and design of the fee. In designing a fee, Congress has various mechanisms it can use to strike a balance between flexibility and oversight (see fig. 5). Agency use of fee collections is determined by Congress. If fee collections must be annually appropriated to an agency before the agency may obligate and expend such collections, an agency has less independence in using them than fees that are permanently appropriated. Requiring an appropriation increases opportunities for Congressional oversight on a regular basis. Expenditures from the Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund (HMTF), for example, are subject to annual appropriation, enabling Congress to annually determine the level of federal spending on harbor maintenance rather than automatically equating spending with total fee collections. Although the HMTF had a balance of almost $4 billion at the end of fiscal year 2007, the Corps obligated $798 million and $910 million from the fund in fiscal years 2006 and 2007, respectively. The level of spending from the HMTF reflects Congressional priorities, possibly including reduction of the overall federal budget deficit. Some stakeholders said, however, that there is a backlog of harbor maintenance needs and that the misalignment between the amount of fee collections and expenditures undermines the credibility of the fee. Conversely, a fee may be designed to give the agency authority to use collections without additional Congressional action; this design may enable the agency to respond more quickly to customers or to changing conditions. For example, the authorizing statute makes USDA Agricultural Marketing Services (AMS) fees directly available to the agency without further Congressional action. A 1999 USDA report on user fees noted that because AMS’s services are voluntary and because the agency is financed largely through user fees, AMS has a strong incentive to develop services for which the industry is willing to pay. The report also asserts that if AMS did not retain these fees, innovations in service delivery would generate no financial return for the agency. Further, the report stated that expanded agency discretion for the use of fee collections will have the greatest effect in agencies with substantial discretion for adjusting the types and amounts of services they provide. Creating a structure for oversight becomes even more important when agency discretion to use fee collections is expanded. Permanent authority for fee collections also increases agency flexibility. With permanent authority, funds are available until expended, which enables agencies to carry forward unexpended collections to subsequent years and match fee collections to average program costs over more than 1 year. Such carryovers are one way agencies can establish reserve accounts, that is, revenue to sustain operations in the event of a sharp downturn in collections. For programs in which fees are expected to cover program costs and program costs do not necessarily decline with a drop in fee collections, a reserve is important. For example, the AQI fee statute gives APHIS permanent authority to use the collected fees and APHIS maintains a reserve in case of emergency. According to APHIS, the reserve is necessary because the AQI program is funded solely through user fee collections. However, with permanent spending authority, agencies may have less incentive to limit total collections to total costs. Whether a fee program is designated as mandatory or discretionary within the budget context may affect the federal budget process more broadly. Mandatory programs are subject to “pay-as-you-go” (PAYGO) rules if they are in effect. Under such budget rules, increases in mandatory spending or decreases in revenue must be deficit neutral, that is, they must be offset by a decrease in mandatory spending or an increase in revenue. For example, if the rate of the HMF, which is classified as a mandatory governmental receipt, were reduced and total collections decreased, Congress would have to offset the lost revenues to comply with PAYGO rules. This requirement has in the past led to situations in which extensions of expiring fees are used to offset increases in unrelated programs. Programs that are classified as discretionary are affected by applicable discretionary spending limits under the Concurrent Budget Resolution. Because some fees are classified as discretionary spending, they must be considered in discretionary spending calculations. Whether fees are designed so that collections are received directly or on a reimbursement basis also affects agency flexibility. The former offers the advantage of making funds immediately available to an agency, increasing its flexibility to plan and respond to changing conditions. The AQI fee collections are shared between CBP and APHIS, but only APHIS has authority to use its portion of the collections directly. According to APHIS, having the funds automatically available is useful because it facilitates the ability to keep pace with workload demands and respond quickly to unplanned needs. CBP’s portion of the AQI fee collections—as well as its portion of the Immigration User Fee—is set up as a “reimbursable account,” wherein the agency must spend other appropriations and apply for reimbursement. This design means it takes longer for CBP to get fee collections than for APHIS. According to CBP, this “reimbursable” arrangement results in less flexibility and a greater administrative burden. Similarly, issues may occur when a program has large up-front costs (e.g., to develop an information technology system or purchase a capital asset). Fees collected over subsequent years to cover those costs would need to be either transferred to the U.S. Treasury’s general fund or “saved” for future capital expenditures, depending on the statutory authority, because they cannot be used to reimburse appropriations made in a prior fiscal year. How broadly or narrowly Congress defines the authorized uses for the fee affects agency flexibility. For example, the AQI fee statute makes the fee collections available to cover the costs of providing agricultural quarantine inspection services and administrative costs related to the fee. The customs inspection fees, however, are only available to reimburse appropriations for a limited, prioritized set of activities. Congress may also limit agency flexibility in the use of the fees by directing the agency to use the fees at the location where the fees were collected. NPS had a now- expired pilot program under which 80 percent of fee collections were retained and used by the park where they were collected. Statutes that narrowly limit how fees may be used could reduce Congress’s and an agency’s flexibility in making resource decisions and reduce the agency’s ability to adjust to changing priorities or program needs. The previously referenced NPS program is an example. We reported that restricting use of the 80 percent of fee collections from the NPS program to the sites at which they were collected created funding imbalances. This restriction resulted in some high-revenue sites having more revenue than needed to meet priority needs and contributed to a backlog of priority needs at lower-revenue sites. Restrictions on use of fees may fail to keep pace with program needs over time as activities that support the service change. This can result in authorized activities that are misaligned with actual service or program activities. We recently reported, for example, that CBP officials said that since the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, the merchandise processing program has a greater focus on security than was the case in previous years. Although the increase is understandable, it has led to a situation in which activities associated with merchandise processing, including screening and inspecting conveyances and inspecting vessels and containers, are not reimbursable by the Merchandise Processing Fee (MPF), even though CBP views these activities as part of the merchandise processing service, the cost of which is offset by MPF collections. Recalling the earlier discussion in this guide about public versus private benefits, if it is determined that a portion of merchandise processing activities primarily relates to national security—benefits that primarily accrue to the general public—a case could also be made that the corresponding costs be funded by general revenues. Finally, although narrowing the authorized uses of a fee in statute may facilitate Congressional oversight, it can also increase agency administrative costs. Ensuring proper use of fee collections may require collecting more detailed cost data at a greater cost to the agency. For example, we recently reported that CBP must track the time CBP officers spend on authorized activities for several of its inspection fees. To help address a concern that timekeeping was taking time away from officers’ inspection duties, CBP implemented a standard process for tracking time in early 2007. The process includes estimating the amount of time officers conducting different functions (e.g., vessel or passenger inspections) spend on different activities, including customs, immigration, and agricultural quarantine inspections. These challenges mean that statutory fee authorities that make fee collections available for obligation and expenditure for limited purposes may require more frequent review and updating for the authorized purposes to remain aligned with program needs. By providing program information to agencies, stakeholders, and Congress, reviews can improve transparency, help ensure that fees remain aligned with program costs and activities, increase awareness of the costs of the federal program, and therefore increase incentives to reduce costs where possible (see fig. 6). Reviews can also provide an opportunity to solicit stakeholder input on the fee and the programs it supports. Fees that are not reviewed and adjusted regularly run the risk of undercharging or overcharging users, raising equity, efficiency, and revenue adequacy concerns. Fee rates may be adjusted by the agency (i.e., by regulation) or by Congress (i.e., by legislation) depending on the statute authorizing a fee. When fees are adjusted by an agency through the regulatory process, fees may be updated more frequently than fees adjusted by legislation and this may improve the ability to keep fee collections aligned with changes in program costs. APHIS, for example, periodically updates the AQI fees through the regulatory process to ensure that collections are aligned with the costs of the program. However, in past reviews stakeholders have expressed distrust and concern about fee rates set by regulation because agencies that retain fee collections may have incentives to artificially inflate the costs of the user fee program. This risk may be reduced, and tools for Congressional and stakeholder oversight enhanced, if the agency clearly reports its methods for setting the fee, including an accounting of program costs and the assumptions it uses to project future program costs and fee collections. On the other hand, when fees are specified and adjusted by legislation, Congress has more tools with which to play an active oversight role, but the fees may not be updated as frequently because of competing legislative priorities and other factors. For example, a fee for registering aircraft with FAA has been an insignificant amount since the 1960s. Fees set by statute can, of course, be regularly adjusted. Such Congressional reviews and updates may be triggered in several ways, including a sunset provision. FDA prescription drug fees, for example, are authorized for 5 years at a time. A sunset provision, however, may not guarantee that a fee will be adjusted to reflect changes in program costs. Although the MPF includes a sunset provision, the maximum and minimum fees, which are set in legislation, have not been adjusted since 1995. Congress may provide strict guidelines within which an agency may set fees through a regulatory process that may depend on further Congressional action. For example, the 2007 prescription drug user fee authorizing legislation set base fee revenue amounts for fiscal years 2008 through 2012. For each year after 2008, the law permits FDA to adjust the base fee revenue amounts to account for inflation and workload, and to set fees annually through the regulatory process so that total projected fee collections will approximate the revenue levels set in statute. To ensure that Congress, stakeholders, and agencies have complete information about changing program costs and whether authorized activities align with program activities, agencies must substantively review and report on their fees on a regular basis. When a fee’s authorizing statute does not specify review and reporting requirements, and for fees that derive their statutory authority from IOAA, the Chief Financial Officers (CFO) Act of 1990 and OMB Circular No. A-25 provide for biennial fee reviews that include recommendations about adjustments to the fees, as appropriate. The regulatory process is also used to provide information on fees to Congress and stakeholders and to solicit stakeholder input. When an agency has authority to adjust a fee through the regulatory process, it should make substantive information about recent and projected program costs and fee collections available to the public through notices in the Federal Register. For example, in 2004 APHIS set the AQI fee rates for fiscal years 2005 through 2010. It published the new fee rates, along with descriptions of the costs of the program, projected program costs and fee collections, and the assumptions it used to make those projections, in the Federal Register. Similarly, USCIS notified the public of proposed fee adjustments in the Federal Register. The notice provided information on the program’s workload and the agency’s methodology for determining program costs, including a list of program activities, how it accounts for the cost of providing services to users exempt from the fees, and its assumptions about inflation. For fees set in regulation, agencies must solicit stakeholder input by requesting comments in the Federal Register. This provides an opportunity for stakeholders to comment on proposed regulatory changes—via written communication, not face-to-face conversations. As the passenger facility charge user fee was implemented, for example, stakeholders provided comments regarding the fee, many of which ultimately were addressed in the final design of the fee. Nevertheless, we previously reported that nonfederal stakeholders have said that relying solely on notice and comment through the Federal Register is insufficient for obtaining stakeholder input. In the past, APHIS solicited stakeholder comments as it adjusted the AQI fee, but it updated the fee using an interim final rule that took effect prior to the end of the comment period. Although an interim final rule does not preclude an agency from making changes to the final rule, stakeholders said that APHIS did not take their comments on the AQI fees into account because comments were not solicited before the change was implemented and because no changes to the fee were made during final rule making. Based on guidance from OMB, APHIS is no longer updating its fees using interim final rules. Whatever the means for disseminating information about the fee, if the review is not comprehensive, it may not provide sufficient information to assess whether a fee needs to be changed. For example, we recently reported that the information on the MPF in CBP’s biennial fee review was insufficient to either project fee collections or to provide assurance that the amount of the fee was aligned with program costs. This was the case because the review lacked projections of future MPF collections, the effects of exemptions, and changes in import demographics. We noted that without this information, CBP is not able to either determine if the amount, structure, or authorized uses of the fee should be changed or comment on the need for any changes to the fee statute. CBP’s review noted that a detailed analysis of the current and estimated future effects of MPF exemptions, changes in import demographics, and a reliable cost estimate for processing merchandise are needed. Transparent processes for reviewing and updating fees help assure payers and other stakeholders that fees are set fairly and accurately and are spent on the programs and activities Congress intended. Also, because user fees represent a charge for a service or benefit received from a specific government program, payers may expect a tight link between payments and the cost of providing services and have expectations about the quality of the related service. Effectively communicating with stakeholders involves sharing relevant analysis and information as well as providing opportunities for stakeholder input. In past user fee reviews, we have reported that agencies that do not communicate with stakeholders miss opportunities for meaningful feedback that could affect the outcome of changes in fees and program implementation. Providing for stakeholder input may affect their support for and acceptance of the fee, and may contribute to improved understanding about how the fees work and what activities they may fund. Payers may also expect to participate in decisions about the provision of the service, including its form or quality. For example, in prior work on a proposed user fee for FAA services, we found that some stakeholders stated that if user fees are adopted, users should have more input into FAA’s operations, citing the “user pays, user says” concept. Soliciting stakeholder input is particularly important because government is often a monopoly supplier—that is, alternatives are limited so some fees are not fully voluntary—users cannot “vote with their dollars” as freely as they can in a competitive private market. Agencies can accommodate payers’ and stakeholders’ input in various ways. The authorizing legislation of some but not all fees stipulates that the agency solicit stakeholder input in certain forms, including an advisory committee. The immigration inspection fees statute, for example, directed the Attorney General to establish an advisory committee, whose membership consists of entities subject to the fees, to advise the agency on the performance of the inspectional services and the level of fees. As we recently reported, the legislation that authorized the HMF did not establish an HMF advisory committee, although it did establish an advisory committee for a similar user-funded program for new work construction and rehabilitation on inland waterways. PDUFA requires FDA to work with stakeholders, including representatives from consumer, patient, and health provider groups and the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries, to develop performance goals for the FDA prescription drug review program. It is important, however, that actions are taken to ensure that fee programs do not become solely beholden to stakeholder interests. Where Congress and fee payers agree on priorities, there may be no conflict between oversight and accountability to Congress on the one hand and accountability to fee payers on the other. Where Congressional and fee payer priorities differ, however, the agency may be under greater pressure to satisfy the demands of fee payers, particularly when a fee is voluntary. For example, although the FDA performance goals may be consistent with PDUFA’s goal to improve FDA application processing times for new prescription drugs, a Congressional Research Service report on the fees cited some critics as saying that giving the pharmaceutical industry a role in setting program performance goals creates conflicts of interest and gives the industry too much influence over FDA actions. We previously identified several promising practices for forming and managing federal advisory committees that could better ensure that committees are, and are perceived as being, independent and balanced. These practices include (1) obtaining nominations for committees from the public, (2) using clearly defined processes to obtain and review pertinent information on potential members regarding potential conflicts of interest and points of view, and (3) prescreening prospective members using a structured interview. The normative principles outlined in this guide are meant to present a framework for considering user fee design. Any user fee design embodies trade-offs among equity, efficiency, revenue adequacy, and administrative burden. Focusing only on the pros and cons of any single design element could make it difficult to achieve consensus on a fee’s design. Instead, policymakers will ultimately need to balance the relative importance they place on each of these criteria and focus on the overall fee design. There are always exceptions to any rule, however; as such, there will undoubtedly be cases in which policy considerations outweigh normative design principles. Nevertheless, the criteria, questions, and illustrative examples presented in this guide present real issues that policymakers must face when designing or redesigning user fees. See appendix I for a summary of key questions to consider. We provided a draft of this guide to the Director of the Office of Management and Budget and the Secretaries of Homeland Security, Defense, and Agriculture for review. We received technical comments from each agency, which we incorporated as appropriate. We are sending copies of this guide to interested Congressional committees as well as the Director of the Office of Management and Budget and the Secretaries of Homeland Security, Defense, and Agriculture. In addition, this guide will be available at no charge on the GAO Web site at http://www.gao.gov. If you or your staff have any questions about this guide, please contact me at (202) 512-9142 or irvings@gao.gov.

As new priorities emerge, policymakers have demonstrated interest in user fees as a means of financing new and existing services. User fees can be designed to reduce the burden on taxpayers to finance the portions of activities that provide benefits to identifiable users above and beyond what is normally provided to the public. By charging the costs of those programs or activities to beneficiaries, user fees can also promote economic efficiency and equity. However, to achieve these goals, user fees must be well designed. GAO was asked to study how user fee design characteristics may influence the effectiveness of user fees. Specifically, GAO examined how the four key design and implementation characteristics of user fees--how fees are set, collected, used, and reviewed--may affect the economic efficiency, equity, revenue adequacy, and administrative burden of cost-based fees. GAO reviewed economic and policy literature on federal and nonfederal user fees, including prior GAO work, and used relevant case examples to illustrate different types of design elements and the impacts they may have. Setting user fees according to the beneficiary-pays principle can promote equity and economic efficiency. For cost-based fees, the extent to which a program provides benefits to the general public versus users and the cost of providing those benefits should, theoretically, guide how much of total program costs are paid for by user fees and the amount each user pays (see figure). Although this principle provides a useful guideline for setting fees, strictly following the principle is not always desirable or practical. The primary challenge of determining when and how to collect a fee is striking a balance between ensuring compliance and minimizing administrative costs. In some cases, the collection systems of another agency or a nonfederal entity, such as a private sector enterprise, may be leveraged, as when the airlines collect passenger inspection fees. Determining how fees will be used is a balancing act between Congressional oversight and agency flexibility. Congress gives agencies various degrees of access to collected fees. For example, fees may be dedicated to the related program or may instead be deposited to the general fund of the U.S. Treasury and not used specifically for the related program or agency. In addition, fee collections may be subject to appropriation or obligation limits, which increase opportunity for oversight but may limit agencies' ability to quickly respond to changing conditions. Agencies must substantively review their fees on a regular basis to ensure that they, Congress, and stakeholders have complete information. Reviews provide information on whether the fee rates and authorized activities are aligned with actual program costs and activities, may provide opportunities for stakeholder input, and can help promote understanding and acceptance of the fee.",govreport
"In school year 2009-2010, the District’s school system enrolled more than 72,300 students and was comprised of 58 local educational agencies (LEA). These included DCPS, the largest LEA with 129 schools, and 57 public charter schools. D.C.’s public charter schools act in most respects as independent and autonomous LEAs, some of which consist of more than one school location. The number of children attending public charter schools in the District has increased in recent years, with about 38 percent of the District’s children attending these schools in the 2009-2010 school year. D.C. charter schools are independent of traditional public schools and are authorized by the Public Charter School Board (PCSB), whose members are appointed by the District Mayor. The PCSB evaluates the schools’ academic performance and fiscal management, as well as their adherence to local and federal education laws, and has the authority to grant and revoke a school’s charter. D.C. public charter schools must independently lease or purchase school buildings for their use and, as previously reported by GAO, have consistently encountered problems obtaining cost effective and appropriate facilities. The D.C. Council passed the Public Education Reform Amendment Act of 2007 (Reform Act) in response to persistent challenges facing the school system. This act significantly altered the governance of the D.C. public schools by transferring the day-to-day management of the public schools from the Board of Education to the Mayor. It also created OSSE to serve in the same capacity as a state education agency (SEA). Effective October 1, 2007, DCPS transitioned its responsibilities for all SEA functions to OSSE. OSSE now fulfills the functions of an SEA under federal law, including grant-making, oversight, and maintaining standards, assessments, and federal accountability requirements for elementary and secondary education. OSSE performs these functions for both traditional public and public charter schools throughout D.C. (see figure 1). Both the President and Congress may propose financial assistance to the District in the form of special federal payments in support of specific activities or priorities. Upon being appropriated by Congress, federal payments are provided directly to D.C. agencies from the federal government and are subject to the requirements of the statutory appropriations language. Congress appropriated federal payments for school improvement in the District every fiscal year from 2004 to 2009 to the state education office (now OSSE) to expand D.C. public charter schools and to DCPS to improve public education in the District. During these years, about $190 million in federal payments were provided for these purposes (see table 1). With the exception of 2005, Congress has generally not included statutory language that offers additional specificity on the use of funds. Occasionally, committee reports accompanying the D.C. appropriations acts have stated the committee’s instructions as to the purpose and manner in which the funds should be used. These reports generally list projects and designate amounts for the expansion and improvement of public charter schools; committee reports have not consistently done this for payments to DCPS. The statutory language generally has not specified how or whether these offices should report on the use of the funds. The District’s Office of the Chief Financial Officer (OCFO) uses SOAR t budget and disburse federal payment funds in accordance with annual spending plans created by OSSE and DCPS. These spending plans outline how the agencies will use the funds, including the amounts to be available for specific initiatives or program offices. The agencies’ financial officers report to the District’s OCFO and monitor the financial activities of thei respective agencies. Within OSSE, the Office of Public Charter Schoo Financing and Support (OPCSFS), created in 2003, manages several federally funded programs that provide funding to charter schools for facility financing and grant programs to improve public charter school quality, including federal payments for these purposes. It also provides est technical assistance for grants and supports the dissemination of b practices and innovation at D.C. public charter schools. At DCPS, priorities regarding the use of federal payments are established and managed through the Chancellor’s office, which allocates funds to applicable program offices that implement various academic initiativ For those payments that fund contracts, program offices coordinate procurement activities with the contracting office which has the authori to enter into, administer, and terminate contracts. The program office monitor an awarded. es. d document contractor performance once the contract is According to annual independent audits, OSSE and DCPS have consistently had problems managing grants and contracts. These audits have identified, among other things, internal control deficiencies related to federal grants management at OSSE and procurement practices at DCPS. For example, the District’s fiscal year 2008 Single Audit found that OS SE had a total of 24 material weaknesses regarding internal control over compliance with federal grant program requirements and cash management. Also, an independent review by BDO Seidman, LLP, of DCPS’s internal controls during that time reported weaknesses related to insufficient procurement documentation and grants management. According to D.C.’s independent auditor, because its reviews likely included federal payment expenditures, their findings could also be relevant to these payments. Because of these and other findings, the U.S. Department of Education designated OSSE as a “high risk” grantee in 2007, when OSSE took over responsibility for the District’s education programs. While OSSE reports having taken corrective actions to address many of the longstanding financial, grants management, and program compliance issues that have plagued the D.C. public school system, the U.S. Department of Education has maintained a high risk designation for OSSE. Of the nearly $85 million in federal payment funds designated by Congress for the District’s public charter schools, OSSE has used approximately 77 percent—about $65 million—of these payments to help finance charter school facilities (see figure 2). OSSE has allocated approximately $17 million for other initiatives to improve the quality of public charter school education, such as supplemental education (e.g. a college preparatory program that included summer enrichment programs and standardized test preparation), and for other activities to address public charter school needs. OSSE also used nearly $1.5 million for administrative purposes and the remaining funds on other activities that included a truancy center and data collection efforts. OSSE has used roughly $65 million of federal payments to award more than 80 grants and loans to help public charter schools build, improve, lease, or purchase facilities (see table 2). According to OSSE, public charter schools often face challenges in funding facilities-related projects. Despite receiving an annual per pupil facility allowance to help pay for rent or mortgage and other facilities’ costs, public charter schools often need to supplement this with other sources of funding. Schools frequently need additional financing to purchase, renovate, or build facilities; to explore facility and financing options; and to make facility improvements. OSSE has funded various grants to not only improve school facilities but to also simultaneously meet other District needs such as creating community partnerships, revitalizing neighborhoods, and promoting the use of public facilities. The facilities projects that grantees, such as charter schools and nonprofit organizations, undertook range from building new campuses to conducting overdue maintenance on heating and cooling systems to updating security equipment and technology systems. For example, a public charter school that is a public facilities grantee used funds to help finance renovations and upgrades of a former D.C. public school to expand the number of students the school could serve. Among other things, the grantee updated mechanical, electrical, and plumbing systems; repaired roofing; replaced windows; and constructed a new gymnasium. Another public charter school that is a City Build grantee, received funds from OSSE to help build new classrooms so that it could expand the grade-levels that it serves, build vocational classrooms such as a barber shop, and create staff offices. OSSE allocated almost $17 million to award a range of grants on quality school initiatives or unmet needs (see table 3). These projects cut across several areas focused on supplemental education activities—which are activities that are provided in addition to those that occur during the course of the typical school day—and activities conducted during the school day to enrich students’ instruction. For example, between 2005 and 2008, OSSE awarded 41 incentive award grants to help schools enhance, improve, or implement an innovative program that would improve student learning and achievement or to start or expand their physical education programs. Some of the projects that schools undertook with this grant included the expansion of a reading buddies literacy volunteer program, a string instrument music program, and several physical education initiatives to address obesity. OSSE has also funded grants to help students prepare for and improve their access to college. For example, as directed in the conference report accompanying the District’s 2005 appropriations act, OSSE provided funding to the Educational Advancement Alliance to implement a college preparatory program. This program aimed to assist 9th through 12th graders with course enrollment, precollege advising, financial aid counseling, test preparation, college application completion, and career exploration and leadership development. Between 2004 and 2009, OSSE spent about $2.5 million to administer federal payment programs and undertake other projects. Specifically, OSSE allocated about $1.5 million for administration of federal payment programs, according to data provided by OSSE. OSSE funded several other projects such as a review of Medicaid billing policies and potential practices to help ensure that public charter schools received appropriate Medicaid reimbursement. OSSE also funded a data collection and analysis project to review public charter school data collection systems, coordinate data collection to ensure the systems are compatible with the entities that need to use them (e.g., the LEA, SEA, and charter school authorizers), and develop assessments to track student performance. According to OSSE officials, OSSE employs a range of activities to monitor public charter schools and other entities that receive grants funded by federal payments (federal payment grantees), but has limited written policies and procedures for conducting monitoring activities. OSSE typically outlines the monitoring activities it will employ in the request for grant applications and includes specific time frames for these activities and deliverables in grant agreements. In establishing their approach, OSSE officials stated that they try to balance OSSE’s monitoring functions with those of other organizations, such as PCSB, so they do not overburden schools with reporting requirements. Most often, these activities include reviewing financial and narrative performance reports that grantees must submit, reviewing 100 percent of all expenditures prior to providing money to grantees, conducting site visits, and in some instances auditing the grantee’s financial statements. To inform its monitoring process, OSSE officials told us that it also conducts a risk analysis based on the award amount and other information that the office reviews, such as a grantee’s independent audit results, PCSB reviews, and lender information. OSSE indicated that since 2007, it has implemented several operational improvements to monitor the use of federal payment funds. For example, OSSE also developed a document that outlines questions that staff should ask grantees and acceptable evidence the staff should review as part of their monitoring. However, we found OSSE lacks documented procedures on how staff should carry out and maintain records of these activities, including how to determine the level of risk based on the information from others’ reviews, and relies on more experienced staff to provide guidance and training. According to the Director of OPCSFS, staff generally should maintain documentation of their monitoring activities, such as grantee reports, in a grantee’s file. However, OPCSFS does not have written procedures or guidance on what should be maintained in the grantee files. The Director also stated that he would like to create a standardized file management process. According to the Director of OPCSFS, one of the main components of OSSE’s monitoring process is the review of invoices prior to reimbursing grantees for expenditures. OSSE developed a standardized form that grantees are to submit with invoices for staff to review prior to reimbursement. The files we reviewed included evidence that grantees submitted and staff reviewed the required reimbursement forms and invoices. According to the Director, the reimbursement process provides the opportunity for an extra level of monitoring in that OSSE compares expenditures with the intended purpose of the grant and approves or denies reimbursement based on this assessment. OSSE staff did not consistently document their collection and review of grantee narrative and financial reports. According to an OSSE official, these reports are used to help OSSE monitor grantees’ use of funds and their impact. Less than one-third of the files we reviewed contained all of the reports that were required during the grant award period, and one- third of the files had no reports (see figure 3). In instances in which files did not include all of the reports, the Director indicated that this may be because the grantee did not submit the reports or the staff responsible for monitoring the grantee did not put the report in the file. Of the files that did contain reports, several were submitted late—ranging from a couple of days to more than 3 months. Further, the files did not consistently have evidence that staff followed-up to obtain the reports. When there was evidence of staff follow-up, it was sometimes not until months after a report was due. For example, two files that had no reports included notices to grant recipients requesting that they submit final performance reports since they had been reimbursed for the amount of the grant award. An OSSE official stated that OSSE may withhold further payments on grants when grantees have failed to provide regular reports or other required documentation, but we saw no indication in the files that this happened. The files we reviewed also rarely had evidence that staff conducted site visits. An OPCSFS official told us that while the office conducts site visits “as necessary,” staff generally try to visit a school at least once during the grant award period. During these site visits, OSSE staff may interview school officials, review the school’s accounting practices, and request documentation on a program’s performance, among other things. We only found evidence of four site visits for the 30 files we reviewed. OSSE found that two of the schools visited needed to take corrective actions. Specifically, one school did not have adequate tools to measure the impact of the program as outlined in its grant agreement and the other did not maintain proper contractor records. According to the files, OSSE followed up with both schools to ensure that they were addressing the issues identified during the site visits. According to the expenditure data D.C. provided, DCPS has used its $105 million in federal payments for school improvement since 2004 for a variety of purposes—ranging from summer school programs to staff incentive pay. However, a lack of available information describing programs or initiatives funded with federal payments prior to 2009 precludes a full identification of the use of these funds. DCPS officials provided spending plans and other programmatic information that described program goals, objectives, activities, and outcomes related to DCPS’s use of federal payments since 2009; however, they could not provide similar information for prior years. DCPS officials stated that they searched for documentation that may have been created by the prior administration, including spending plans and guidance for 2007 and 2008, but were unable to recover any documentation that prior administrations may have developed or used. In 2009, under the current administration, DCPS used $40 million in federal payments primarily for supplemental education programs, staff incentive pay, and staff salaries, based on expenditure data (see figure 4). According to DCPS officials, it currently funds activities aligned with DCPS’s 5-year strategic plan and district-wide priorities designed to increase student achievement. Some of these funds were provided directly to schools, while others supported school administration functions within DCPS. These funding priorities are outlined in spending plans that guide the budgeting process and are submitted to Congress. Staff incentive pay. DCPS set aside almost $10 million of federal payments in 2009 to provide merit-based awards to eligible teachers and staff through a new assessment system called “IMPACT” when a contract agreement was reached with the Washington Teachers’ Union. Implemented in the 2009-2010 school year, the IMPACT system rates teachers and noninstructional staff, such as guidance counselors and custodians, on a combination of factors to assess and provide feedback on performance. For example, teachers are assessed on, among other things, the impact they and the school have on students’ learning over the course of the year, classroom observations, and commitment to the school community. Counselors, meanwhile, are assessed on DCPS counseling standards and commitment to the school community. Staff salaries. About $5.9 million was used to pay staff salaries and benefits distributed to schools through DCPS’s Comprehensive Staffing Model. According to DCPS, this model was first instituted in the 2008-2009 school year and is designed to ensure that all schools, regardless of size or location, offer a full complement of programs, including art, music, and physical education classes. It also helps schools provide services, such as social workers and psychologists, to support students’ nonacademic needs. The model distributes resources on a formula basis across the school district, and in 2009, according to DCPS, federal payment funds helped to hire and retain staff at 89 schools. Professional development. DCPS spent $5.7 million on teacher and principal development activities. Funds supported the Master Educator Program, whereby experienced educators traveled from school to school evaluating teachers and providing support as part of the IMPACT performance system. According to DCPS, educators provided targeted professional development to help teachers improve their instruction. Funds were also used for a “Principals’ Academy”—a monthly professional development session. According to DCPS, these meetings were used to train principals on effective parent and community engagement and share best practices on leadership. Finally, funds supported Partnership Schools where staff in low-performing schools received additional resources, expertise, and professional development opportunities from organizations hired to manage the schools. Supplemental education. DCPS used about $5.7 million for summer school activities and $2 million for the Saturday Scholars program. Saturday Scholars is a 12-week program that provides additional help in math and reading to students in grades 3-12. Data reporting. DCPS used about $6 million to fund data reporting activities that could provide parents with information on the performance of their children, classrooms, and schools. These initiatives included the DCPS School Scorecard, an annually released report on each school detailing school safety, culture, student growth, and family involvement in the school; stakeholder surveys; and a student information system to keep parents informed. Supplies. In 2009, DCPS used $3 million of the federal payments to purchase textbooks. Other activities. DCPS spent the remaining payments on other activities in 2009. For example, it provided $1.5 million to the Capital Gains Program, which, in partnership with Harvard University, provided financial literacy education and incentive payments for academic performance, behavior, and attendance to more than 3,000 students in grades six to eight. For the period between 2004 and 2008, D.C. provided expenditure data showing that DCPS used federal payments to fund a variety of programs for early childhood education, supplemental education, professional development activities, and supply purchases. While DCPS worked to provide information on programs funded prior to 2009, it could not locate detailed programmatic information on most expenditures to explain the goals, objectives, activities, and outcomes of these programs and we cannot, therefore, fully describe the use of federal payments for these years (see figure 5). According to DCPS, prior administrations may not have consistently created or maintained documentation on some of the programs they implemented. For example, expenditure data indicate that between 2004 and 2007, DCPS used $37.4 million to fund a literacy improvement program; however, DCPS was unable to provide information to describe the program’s goals, objectives, or outcomes. Additionally, we were unable to characterize approximately 36 percent of the other activities because DCPS could not provide information describing the expenditures beyond what was maintained for accounting purposes. In 2007, for example, 27 schools received “high performance awards.” Current DCPS officials were not able to ascertain why those schools received the funds. The lack of detailed information to fully describe the programs for which funds were expended also precludes us from assessing whether DCPS used funds as directed to do so by appropriations legislation. The 2005 District appropriation act states that DCPS shall use not less than $2 million of that year’s payments on a new incentive fund to reward improved schools and not less than $2 million on a transformation initiative directed to schools in need of improvement. While 20 expenditure data shows DCPS spent $9.8 million on a literacy improvement program, we cannot determine whether these or the remaining funds appropriated in that year were used for the two initia outlined in legislation. Expenditure data did not capture information linked to specific legislated initiatives, and according to agency officials, DCPS does not have records of the plans that would describe the incentive fund or the transformation initiative. DCPS program offices have employed a variety of methods to monitor contractor performance; however, in practice we found evidence of weaknesses in carrying out some monitoring responsibilities possibly attributable to staff turnover and a lack of a formal process to reassign responsibilities when turnover occurs. Specifically, in our revie and 2009 contract files, we found 7 of 14 files with incomplete documentation and evidence of review as well as missing files (see appendix II). DCPS’s Office of Contracts and Acquisitions has policies that specify a program officer’s responsibilities to monitor contractor pe program offices have flexibility on how to carry out these responsibilities. Pursuant to their monitoring responsibilities, program officers are to ensure that technical work is performed in accordance with the terms and conditions of the contract, maintain a contract file, review invoices, perform periodic site visits, and provide periodic written report and a final performance evaluation. Additionally, files maintained at the contracting office should consistently contain the name of the ass igned program officer who is responsible for contract oversight. In our discussions with a number of program offices, we were shown differen strategies they employ to fulfill their monitoring responsibilities. One program officer, who oversees a contract that provides an after school program, showed us a tool designed to track site visits. The document records observations of tutoring sessions to assess the tutor’s subje ct- matter knowledge, presentation style, and classroom management abilities. Another program officer did not conduct site visits because the contractors were often located at the program office and could be t observed on a more regular basis. That office independently a program to track deliverables across contracts it managed. In our review of contracting office files, we saw inconsistent documentation of monitoring activities related to the assignment of program officers and the lack of required evaluations on contractors’ performance. In our review of 14 contract files, we found that som contained notes from the contracting staff that the program officer left before the end of the contract term, and the file had no evidence that anew program officer was assigned. DCPS officials stated that the monitoring function has been impacted by staff turnover, and one offici said it is not uncommon for a contract to be overseen by two or three different program officers over the life of the contract. However, staff turnover alone does explain the lack of adequate monitoring. Program officials we spoke with stated that their respective offices did not have written protocols and procedures for transitioning responsibilities when a program officer leaves, nor did they have written processes for how to notify the contracting office. According to officials, staff generally the contracting office via e-mail when a program officer left, however, we did not see evidence of correspondence in those files. Recognizing that the specific nature and extent of contract administration may contract, one program official told us that it would be helpful for DCPS to develop a list of basic information that should be collected across program offices to ensure continuity in the event of staff turnover. Moreover, 4 of the 14 contract files we reviewed—totaling $2.7 million— were missing performance evaluations, and evaluations of 3 additional contractors were not completed within the required time frames. Performance evaluations are an important tool to help the contracting and program offices determine whether to extend a contract, and these evaluations must be submitted before a contract extension can be awarded. The evaluations are required to be submitted within 30 days of the end of the contract; however, one of the evaluations was submitted more than 1.5 years late. Further, one contract file that lacked a performance evaluation and two files that were submitted late were awarded contract extensions. According to a contracting official, staff from his office should take steps to gather this information from program staff, but we did not find evidence in the files that officials followed up to obtain these documents, or that many of the files had supervisory review. An official with the contracting office stated that it might also be helpful to have more regular formal assessments of contractor performance, and the on a office recently asked program officers to begin evaluating contractors monthly basis. The DCPS contracting office, which is responsible for maintaining all contract documentation, could not locate 3 of the 17 contract files we requested. According to a contracting official, DCPS recently moved and sent its contracts to storage and was having problems locating the files during the period of our review. DCPS could not locate the original file for one of the contracts, was unsure whether one contract was in fact awarded, and told us the other file could not be located because the name of the company had changed. According to D.C. Municipal Regulations, each D.C. office performing contracting functions is responsible for maintaining files containing records of all contractual actions pertinent to that office’s responsibilities, including documents sufficient to constitute a complete history of the transactions. These files are essential in providing a complete background as a basis for informed decisions at each step of the procurement process as well as providing information for reviews and investigations. Over the years, D.C. public schools have wrestled with numerous challenges: deteriorating facilities, low student performance, and lax administrative and management oversight. D.C. has recently taken steps address the long-standing problems with its public school system, and federal payments have contributed to some of these efforts. The statu language appropriating these funds does not generally direct OSSE and DCPS on how to use these monies for school improvements. It appears that OSSE and DCPS have expended federal payments on a range of activities related to “school improvement”—from facility renovation to summer school programs; however, the lack of detailed information on tory some of these payments dating back to 2004 precludes a complete understanding of their use. A lack of information describing how these funds were used highlights the need for stronger internal controls related to information management across administrations. Moreover, the financial management challenges that others, such as the U.S. Department of Education and D.C. Inspector General, have previous identified also persist with OSSE’s and DCPS’s monitoring of grants made with federal payment funds and contracts, respectively. Specifically, the policies OSSE and DCPS have are not consistently followed and sometimes fall short of commonly accepted standards. Because OSSE and DCPS distribute a large portion of federal payment for school improvement funds through grants and contracts, respectively, effective internal controls over grants and contracts are critical to their missions. Without proper documentation on the use of funds and the applicati strong monitoring framework, these funds may more easily be misused. Further, grantees and contractors may not be held accountable for meeting the agreed upon performance outcomes. In addition, OSSE and DCPS may risk implementing initiatives that fall short of reaching the potential to improve the District’s schools. Documenting required and actual monitoring processes may not completely eliminate potential m isuse of funds, but it could help to mitigate this risk. To improve internal controls for managing the use of federal payments and to provide continuity of information across administrations, we recommend that the Mayor of the District of Columbia take the following two actions: 1. Direct the State Superintendent of Education to establish and implement written policies and procedures for monitoring federal payment grantees. These policies and procedures, which can draw from OSSE’s general monitoring practices, should outline OSSE’s ds of practices for how staff should document and maintain recor m monitoring is appropriately and consistently implemented. onitoring activities and identify other measures to ensure that grant 2. Direct the DCPS Chancellor to establish and implement p contract monitoring to ensure that contract monitoring is appropriately and consistently done. Implementing this recommendation would include documenting monitoring activities ce throughout the term of the contract, directing DCPS to better enfor existing policies to ensure performance evaluations are complete, and rocedures for developing protocols and procedures for transitioning contracting officer responsibilities and for notifying the contracting office. Wh implementing this recommendation, DCPS should develop specific guidance on maintaining contract files and other documentation relevant to the use of these funds to ensure that contract records are available for inspection and as a means of retaining institutional knowledge of contracts. We provided a draft of this report to the D.C. Mayor’s Office, OSSE, and DCPS for review and comment. These entities provided written comme on a draft of this report, which are reproduced in appendix III. DCPS and OSSE generally concurred with our recommendations; however, they expressed concern with the way in which we evaluated their use of fed payments for school improvement and the tone of the draft report. Both OSSE and DCPS indicated that federal payment funds are unique and different from other federal funds and do not require the same reporting and monitoring. While these payments are different than funds provided ucation, a fact we state in the report, through the U.S. Department of Ed we maintain that both OSSE and DCPS should have better practices in place to monitor the use of them. OSSE stated that our recommendation is in line with its continued improvement and oversight of recipients of federal grant funded program and highlighted several of the steps it has taken since 2007 to improve its overall operations as well as the management of federal payment funds. OSSE also indicated that it will borrow from existing District and agency - wide protocols for monitoring federal payment funds, when appropriate. In our report, we recognize the processes OSSE has in place to monitor grantees; however, we continue to believe that these processes should b better documented. As indicated in our recommendation, we agree thatdrawing from existing practices that are documented is a good step for OSSE to take in ensuring that federal payment funds are appropriately monitored. OSSE also stated that our on-site review only included hard copy f During the course of our review, OSSE did indicate that it maintains some information electronically. We subsequently requested additional information that OSSE maintains on federal payment grantees, including electronic information that tracks the receipt of grantee reports. As of the time we drafted our report, OSSE had not responded to our repeated requests for this information. Regardless of whether information is maintained in hard copy or electronic form, we continue to believe that iles. OSSE should have in writing its procedures for documenting and monitoring grantees. OSSE agrees that is necessary and indicated that it would take steps to address our recommendation by June 2011. DCPS agreed with our recommendation to improve monitoring acti and maintain contract files and other applicable documents. In its response, DCPS provided information on several procedures it has recently put in place to implement more effective monitoring. These include, among other things, instituting and maintaining documentation on monthly performance evaluations and requiring contracting an officers to sign documentation acknowledging their roles and responsibilities at the beginning of the contract term. DCPS stated that these steps will mitigate the risk of not retaining an appropriate program officer for the duration of the contract. As indicated in our draft repo the time of our review, DCPS did have policies in place that clearly outlined the roles and responsibilities of the program staff. While establishing monthly performance evaluations and reinforcing staffs’ roles and responsibilities are important steps towards more effective monitoring sting practices, we maintain that DCPS needs to better enforce new and exi practices throughout the continuous monitoring. life of the contract to ensure consistent and DCPS’s response also identified areas of the report that they found to be d misleading or incomplete. Specifically, DCPS was concerned that we di not provide a sufficient explanation of the historical context of federal payments, including the use of the term “school improvement payments, which might be confused with other federal school improvement funds provided by the U.S. Department of Education. In our opening paragraph and the report background we state that federal payments are unique and separate from other federal funding, and that our use of the term “federal payments” throughout the report refers to these differentiated fund , we have subsequently not monies from federal agencies; however changed our title to help clarify this point. ” In addition, DCPS was concerned that the report does not adequately address the fact that during the current administration, programmatic initiatives and expenditures against those initiatives were clearly and w s documented. We disagree. On page 15 and again on pages 18-19 of thi report, we state that D.C. provided expenditure data for all years we requested and that the current administration has created spending plan and other programmatic information describing the planned and actual use of funds since 2009. DCPS also commented that we did not adequ explain the steps DCPS took to locate documentation from the prior ately administration that we requested. In response to this, we have provided additional clarification in the report, where appropriate, to explain that current DCPS officials took steps to locate information we requested on federal payment use prior to 2009, but spending plans or programmatic information that they could not locate may not have been created by prior administrations. DCPS also stated that it could have been more responsive in providin missing information for applicable contract files and documents for inspection if it were advised of the specific documentation deficiency referenced in the report. At the time of our file review, we worked with contracting office officials, and did, on several occasions, identify and request from them missing contract files and information. These officials or indicated that the documentation should have been in the contract file that they could not locate the information. Given our findings and the challenges DCPS had in locating information for our report, we continu ld to believe that DCPS can improve its monitoring processes and shou have practices in place to ensure these processes are implemented. We also provided a copy of the draft report to the independent D.C. Office ed technical comments on the of the Chief Financial Officer which provid draft that we incorporated as appropriate. We are sending copies of this report to the D.C. Mayor’s Office, the Office of the State Superintendent of Education, the DCPS Chancellor’s Office, al the D.C. Office of the Chief Financial Officer, appropriate congression committees, and others who are interested. We will also make copies available to others on request. In addition, the report no charge on GAO’s Web site at http://www.gao.gov. will be available at If you or your staff have any questions about this report, please contact me at (202) 512-7215 or ashbyc@gao.gov. Contact points for our Offices of Congressional Relations and Public Affairs can be found on the last page of this report. GAO staff who made major contributions to this report are listed in appendix IV. To identify the activities that both the Office of the State Superintendent of Education (OSSE) and the District of Columbia Public Schools (DCPS) funded with federal payments, we analyzed allocation and spending data, reviewed documentation provided by the offices, and conducted interviews with officials in these and other knowledgeable offices. We then categorized this information into activities that we identified based on previous GAO work, U.S. Department of Education program descriptions, and categorizations used by DCPS and OSSE when tracking their use of federal payments. Primarily, we analyzed data from the District of Columbia’s (D.C. or the District) financial management system—the System of Accounting and Reporting (SOAR)—and its procurement tracking system—Procurement Automated Support System (PASS). SOAR isolates federal payments from other revenue streams and provides OSSE, DCPS, and the D.C Office of the Chief Financial Officer (OCFO) with real-time information related to revenue and expenditures, among other things. SOAR is interfaced with PASS. We supplemented these data with interviews, spending plans that identify how the offices allocated federal payments, and other documents provided by OSSE and DCPS to describe the purpose and more specific use of funds as well as how they prioritized the use of funds. For example, we used SOAR and PASS data to understand the amount of funds DCPS used for a specific contract or program, but used additional information from DCPS to understand the purpose. For public charter schools, we supplemented the SOAR data with other information received from OSSE, including grant descriptions in the request for applications and summary data on allocations of federal payments. We also reviewed documentation provided by the D.C. Public Charter School Board. Using SOAR data, we identified fields that provided descriptive information on the program or general purpose of funds and the appropriated and expended amount for a given year’s appropriation. These funds were often used across several fiscal years. For example, we used these data to identify public charter schools that received grants and the amount of these grants. We used additional information provided by OSSE to determine the amount of funding in a given appropriation year that was used. We were unable to obtain transaction level data for appropriation year 2004 because, according to an OCFO official, federal payments for charter schools were managed by the Department of Insurance, Securities, and Banking. The department did not respond to our request for this information. We took several steps to assess the reliability of the data provided. We reviewed existing documentation about SOAR and PASS and prior GAO, D.C. Office of the Inspector General (OIG), and Independent Auditor reports that discussed these systems. We also interviewed knowledgeable staff in OCFO, OSSE, and DCPS about how these data were collected, stored, used, and the access controls in place. We interviewed officials within the D.C. OIG and Independent Auditor’s office. We conducted electronic testing on transaction-level data, including checks for missing data elements or out-of-range variables. Given the objectives and scope of our review, we did not conduct transaction testing (e.g., compare data input into the SOAR or PASS systems to invoices or other expenditure documents) to verify the accuracy and classification of data in the SOAR system, nor did we test specific transactions for noncompliance with Antideficiency Act requirements. We did, however, review previous assessments conducted by D.C.’s Independent Auditor that, among other things, included transaction testing. Overall, we found the data to be sufficiently reliable for the purposes of providing an understanding of how federal payments were allocated and expended. To assess OSSE’s monitoring of grantees that received federal payments, we reviewed available information on OSSE’s monitoring practices for federal payment grantees. We also reviewed information on OSSE’s general monitoring practices and reports from the D.C. OIG, U.S. Department of Education, and GAO to understand previously identified weaknesses with grantee monitoring. We also interviewed OSSE officials on their practices. We reviewed 30 of the 34 grantee files for grants that were awarded with fiscal year 2008 and 2009 federal payments to assess OSSE’s monitoring of federal payment grantees that we identified as within our scope. OSSE identified 42 grants that were awarded during this time. However, we eliminated eight from our scope, and OSSE did not respond to our request for four additional files, although OSSE indicated that these files were maintained. Specifically, we eliminated seven grants that, according to data provided by OSSE, were awarded as a “reimbursement” for costs that a school already incurred in developing an application for the use of surplus DCPS facilities. We eliminated these grants because they would not necessitate on-going monitoring given that the deliverable was already completed as a part of the application process. We also eliminated a special education grant, which was for Medicaid Billing and Technical Assistance, because it was an amendment to a November 2007 grant between OSSE and the D.C. Public Charter School Cooperative. We selected 2008 and 2009 grantees because these were the first years that OSSE was responsible for federal payment use and we could capture the most currently available monitoring information. We developed a data collection instrument to record information from the grantee files. We reviewed files for evidence of grantee monitoring, timeliness of grantee reporting, follow-up actions by OSSE staff, submission of required documents by grantees, and other documented actions by OSSE. To ensure that our data collection efforts conformed to GAO’s data quality standards, all files were independently reviewed by two GAO analysts. When the analysts’ views on how the data were recorded differed, they met to reconcile any differences. To assess DCPS’s monitoring of contractors that received federal payments, we reviewed available information on DCPS’s monitoring practices. We obtained this information from the Office of Contracts and Acquisitions, which is responsible for contracts management and oversees purchasing goods and services for DCPS, as well as additional information from four program offices that were responsible for monitoring performance of those contracts funded through federal payments we selected. We also reviewed information on DCPS’s general monitoring practices and reports from the D.C. OIG, BDO Seidman LLP, and GAO to understand previously identified weaknesses with procurement practices and contract monitoring. We originally planned to review all 42 contracts awarded by DCPS for 2008 and 2009; however, based on discussions with DCPS on the challenges of compiling the requested files, we limited our selection to 17 contracts. We were only able to review 14 files because DCPS was unable to provide files for 3 contracts for our review. The 17 contracts we selected represented just under $9.5 million, or 61 percent, of federal payment funds that were distributed through contracts of more than $100,000 in 2008 and 2009. We selected those years to be consistent with our review of grant files from OSSE. We selected our contracts based on the type and size of contracts. Specifically, we selected the highest dollar amount in service contracts that would allow us to assess the monitoring processes throughout the term of the contract as well as the highest dollar amount contracts for goods such as textbooks. Results from this nongeneralizable sample cannot be used to make inferences about all contracts awarded for this time period. To ensure that our data collection efforts conformed to GAO’s data quality standards, all files were independently reviewed by two GAO analysts. When the analysts’ views on how the data were recorded differed, they met and reconciled any differences. While the sample allowed us to learn about many important aspects of DCPS’s monitoring, it was designed to provide an overview of DCPS’s monitoring functions, not findings that would be representative of practices at all program offices within DCPS. We reviewed the purpose of the contract and DCPS offices’ policies and practices for monitoring these contracts. We reviewed files maintained at the Office of Contracts and Acquisitions that included documentation on contractor performance submitted by the program offices, as well as obtained additional information from these program offices. Because none of the DCPS program offices that managed contracts we reviewed maintained contract files, we were unable to fully assess the steps these offices took to monitor the contracts. We did, however, review some of the monitoring tools that individual staff and offices created to track their monitoring. For example, we reviewed project plans, samples of invoices, and other types of information staff maintained to document performance. We did not hold an exit conference with the relevant D.C. agencies because the designated point of contact for the District was unresponsive to our repeated requests to schedule an exit conference. However, at the request of the Mayor’s Office, we met with representatives of the Mayor, OSSE, and DCPS, prior to receiving official comments on the draft report. We conducted this performance audit from October 2009 to November 2010 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. Janet Mascia (Assistant Director), Rachel Beers, Sue Bernstein, Scott McNulty, Jean McSween, James Rebbe, and Nyree M. Ryder Tee all made key contributions to this report.","Between fiscal years 2004 and 2009, Congress appropriated nearly $190 million in federal payments for school improvement to the District of Columbia (D.C.). This includes $85 million to the state education office--currently the Office of the State Superintendent of Education (OSSE)--to expand public charter schools and $105 million to D.C. Public Schools (DCPS) to improve education in public schools. Over the years, GAO and others have identified challenges that DCPS and OSSE face in managing federal monies. This report identifies, on the basis of available information, activities for which OSSE and DCPS used federal payments between 2004 and 2009 and describes how OSSE and DCPS monitored grant and contract recipients, respectively. GAO reviewed expenditure data and interviewed and collected documentation from OSSE and DCPS, among others. GAO reviewed all available grants awarded by OSSE in 2008 and 2009 and 14 of the largest contracts awarded by DCPS during that time. Approximately 77 percent of federal payments for public charter school improvement in D.C. have been awarded for facility costs, including acquiring, renovating, constructing, or leasing facilities. The funding for facilities has mainly been disbursed through direct loans to schools and grants to expand schools in certain neighborhoods as part of a city improvement initiative. OSSE used the remaining funds for initiatives intended to improve the quality of education through efforts such as academic enrichment and supplemental education activities (provided beyond the normal school day), as well as a variety of other charter school expenditures. OSSE officials reported having established some policies and procedures for monitoring its grant recipients, but, with one exception, these were not documented. Furthermore, the procedures as explained to us by OSSE were not consistently followed. OSSE did create a list of information that program staff are to acquire from grantees. However, the grant files we reviewed often lacked evidence that staff collected this information or performed other monitoring activities. Specifically, most of the files did not include all the narrative and financial reports as required by OSSE in many of their grant agreements. Also, few included any record indicating that staff had followed-up to obtain such documents. According to the expenditure data D.C. provided, DCPS has used federal payments for a variety of purposes--ranging from summer school programs to teacher incentive pay--but available information prior to 2009 does not provide enough details for GAO to fully identify specific activities funded with federal payments. In 2009, DCPS used $40 million primarily for teacher incentive pay, salaries for staff such as physical education and art teachers at underserved schools, and supplemental education activities such as summer school. Expenditure data show that between 2004 and 2008, DCPS funded a variety of programs such as supplemental education and professional development; however, DCPS could not locate information that may have been created on specific activities funded with federal payments during this time. For example, about half of these expenditures were for a ""literacy improvement program,"" but DCPS was unable to provide information to describe the program's goals, objectives, activities, or outcomes. DCPS has policies on responsibilities for monitoring contractor performance; however, these policies do not cover how to do the monitoring and they were not consistently followed. According to program office staff, they have some flexibility in how they implement their monitoring responsibilities and have employed a variety of methods to monitor contractor performance. Of the contract files we reviewed, we found that several lacked any evidence of a performance evaluation by a program officer, or any subsequent review. Notes added to several of the files indicated a program officer had left before the end of the contract term; however, we found no indication that these contracts had been reassigned. Furthermore, the contracting office could not locate 3 of the 17 files we requested for our review. To improve internal controls, GAO recommends that the Mayor direct OSSE and DCPS to establish and implement written policies and procedures for monitoring use of federal payments for school improvement, and DCPS to maintain contract files and other expenditure documentation. The District agreed with GAO's recommendations and provided additional information on steps taken to improve internal controls.",govreport
"In each fiscal year, DOD establishes a standard price per barrel to be charged to its fuel customers. The Office of the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller), in coordination with the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA), estimates and sets a standard price for its fuel and other fuel- related commodities that endeavors to closely approximate the actual per barrel price during budget execution, which occurs almost a year later. The Office of the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller) sets the standard price annually based on three components. Crude Oil—The baseline for setting the standard price is the forecasted price for crude oil, which is provided to DOD by OMB. To estimate the cost of crude oil, the Council of Economic Advisors, the Department of the Treasury, and OMB—referred to as the Troika— jointly prepare a set of economic assumptions for agencies to use in preparing their overall budgets. In developing the crude oil price projections, the Troika uses oil price projections coming from the prices in the futures market for both West Texas Intermediate (WTI) and Brent crude oil prices. DOD uses the WTI projection as its baseline. According to OMB Circular A-11, all baseline estimates used in the budget must be consistent with the economic assumptions provided by OMB. Refinement Markup—DOD adds a markup for the cost of refining the crude oil. Because DOD and its customers use refined oil products— such as jet fuel and diesel fuel—DOD has to include the additional cost of refining the fuel in its standard price. This refinement markup is estimated based on the historical price relationship between WTI crude oil and refined product prices. Nonproduct Costs—DOD adds an estimate for nonproduct costs associated with DLA’s overhead, including facilities sustainment, restoration, and modernization; transportation; and storage costs. Other nonproduct costs include an estimate of product losses and may include cost recovery adjustments for prior year fund losses to the Defense-wide Working Capital Fund, legal judgments, and rounding. Figure 1 identifies each of the price components as a percentage of the total standard price for fiscal year 2013. In developing their annual operation and maintenance budget requests, the military services use the standard price and their estimated fuel requirements based on activity levels (such as flying hours, steaming days, tank miles, and base operations). For example, the Air Force as the largest DOD customer for fuel, purchased approximately 49 million barrels in fiscal year 2013, representing 53 percent of all sales to the military services. In determining its Operation and Maintenance funding needs, the Air Force provided an estimate for fuel in its budget request based on an analysis of each aircraft’s fuel usage and future programmed flying hours. Figure 2 below generally illustrates the process and the main organizations involved in budgeting for fuel. DOD utilizes its Defense-wide Working Capital Fund to purchase bulk fuel for customers. According to DOD’s Financial Management Regulation, working capital funds were established to satisfy recurring DOD requirements using a businesslike buyer-and-seller approach. The Defense-wide Working Capital Fund is the Working Capital Fund managed by the defense agencies. The fund consists of six activity groups. Three of these activity groups are operated by DLA, two by the Defense Information Systems Agency, and one by the Defense Finance and Accounting Service. The activity group related to DOD’s bulk fuel program is the DLA Energy Management Activity group, which provides worldwide energy support including bulk fuel purchasing, transportation, and storage for the military services and other customers. The fund covers DLA’s costs for purchasing bulk fuel and is reimbursed through its sale of fuel to the military services and other customers at a standard price. The standard price is intended to remain unchanged until the next budget year. This helps to shield the military services from market price volatility by allowing the cash balance in the fund to absorb minor fuel price fluctuations. According to DOD’s Financial Management Regulation, the goal of the fund is to remain revenue-neutral, allowing the fund to break even over time—that is, to neither make a gain nor incur a loss. During the year the budget is executed, the actual price for a barrel of fuel on the world market may be higher or lower than DOD’s standard price. If the actual price is higher, the cash balance in the Defense-wide Working Capital Fund will go down. If the actual price is lower, the cash balance in the fund will go up. These fluctuations in the cash balance are known as a net outlay. To correct for these fluctuations, DOD may adjust the standard price for the following year. For example, DOD may increase the standard price to make up for losses in the previous year and bolster the cash balance in the fund. Alternatively, DOD may decrease the standard price to reimburse the services, which had paid a higher price the previous year. DOD can also cover fund losses during the execution year by obtaining an appropriation from Congress, transferring funds from another DOD account into the fund, or adjusting the standard price out of cycle. During fiscal years 2009 through 2013, DOD’s actual costs for bulk fuel differed considerably from its budget estimates, due largely to fluctuations in fuel price. During those years, DOD either under- or overestimated what it would have to pay for bulk fuel. The differences between estimated and actual fuel costs were accounted for primarily by fluctuations in the market price for fuel. In each of fiscal years 2010, 2011, and 2012, DOD underestimated its bulk fuel costs by about $3 billion. In 2009, DOD overestimated these costs by about $3 billion and in 2013 by about $2 billion. Table 1 shows the total difference between DOD’s estimated and actual fuel costs for fiscal years 2009 through 2013. We identified two primary factors that accounted for the difference between estimated and actual costs—(1) fluctuations in the market price of fuel and (2) differences between the services’ estimated and actual fuel consumption. Our analysis showed that from fiscal years 2009 through 2013, the differences between the price DOD paid for fuel and the price it charged its fuel customers—the standard price—accounted for, on average, 74 percent of the difference between estimated and actual costs. In fiscal year 2012, for example, DOD estimated a standard price of $131.04 per barrel. DOD’s actual costs during that year averaged $167.33 per barrel—an underestimate of $36.29 per barrel—which represented 85 percent of the underestimate for fiscal year 2012. Figure 3 compares the actual price DLA paid for fuel with the standard price DOD used to calculate its budget estimates. Of the three components that constitute the standard price, crude oil prices and refinement markup costs accounted for most of the difference between the estimated standard price and actual fuel costs during fiscal years 2009 through 2013. In fiscal years 2009 and 2010, differences in the price of crude oil accounted for most of the difference between the estimated and actual prices—in 2009 for 95 percent of the difference and in 2010 for 72 percent. However, during fiscal years 2011 through 2013, the refinement markup became the main driver of the difference, accounting for between 65 and 79 percent of the difference, as shown in table 2. For fiscal years 2009 through 2012, DOD added a markup of 30 percent over the price of WTI to account for refinement costs in setting the standard price. According to DOD officials, the 30 percent markup over the WTI crude oil price had been a generally accurate predictive indicator for the price of DOD’s actual refined fuel costs. However, in fiscal year 2011, actual fuel costs exceeded the price of WTI by an average of 49 percent and in 2012 by an average of 60 percent. Therefore, DOD set the refinement markup too low in those years. According to DOD officials, to account for these differences, DOD increased the markup for refinement costs from 30 percent to 50 percent of the WTI price when developing the standard price for fiscal year 2013. Although fluctuations in fuel prices were, on average, the primary driver of the differences between estimated and actual fuel costs in fiscal years 2009 through 2013, differences between the services’ estimated and actual fuel consumption levels also contributed to the overall difference. These differences accounted for, on average, 26 percent of the difference between DOD’s estimated and actual fuel costs. In fiscal years 2009 through 2012, the military services’ estimated fuel requirements were within 5 percent of their actual consumption, as shown in figure 4. However, in fiscal year 2013, we found that differences between estimated and actual fuel consumption levels became the main driver of the total difference between estimated and actual fuel costs. In that year, DOD underestimated the cost of fuel but overestimated its consumption by approximately 19 million barrels, or 17 percent. According to DOD officials, actual consumption was much lower as a result of actions DOD took to address sequestration. In November 2013, we reported that for fiscal year 2013, DOD’s Operation and Maintenance accounts were reduced by approximately $20 billion, or 7.2 percent, due to sequestration reductions. We identified several actions DOD took to address these budgetary reductions. For example, in fiscal year 2013, the Air Force initially ceased flight operations from April through June for about one- third of active-duty combat Air Force units. Also, the Army curtailed training for all units except those deployed, preparing to deploy, or stationed overseas, and the Navy limited flight training for nondeploying units. DOD has taken actions to manage fluctuations in the cash balance of the Defense-wide Working Capital Fund caused by differences between its estimated and actual fuel costs. These actions included transferring funds into the Defense-wide Working Capital Fund from other accounts and adjusting the standard price DOD charged to its fuel customers. The Defense-wide Working Capital Fund provides the cash balance that is used to fund the day-to-day operations for six defense-wide activity groups, including DLA Energy, which provides, among other things, worldwide energy support to the military services and other authorized customers for bulk fuel purchasing, transportation, and storage. According to a DOD report, the volatility of fuel prices has historically posed a challenge to managing the cash balance of the fund. When DLA pays more or less for fuel than the standard price it charges its customers, the cash balance in the Defense-wide Working Capital Fund will go down or up. For instance, if fuel market prices rise significantly relative to the standard price, the cash balance in the fund will go down. On the other hand, if fuel market prices decrease relative to the standard price, the fund will generate excess cash and the balance will go up. In fiscal years 2009 through 2013, the fluctuations in the cash balance of the Defense-wide Working Capital Fund were partially driven by these net outlays for fuel, as shown in figure 5. The Defense-wide Working Capital Fund is intended to provide DOD with the flexibility to absorb some fluctuation in fuel prices. However, in some instances, DOD has sought to manage the fluctuations in the fund’s cash balance by transferring money into or out of the fund or by adjusting its standard price. For example, in fiscal years 2012 and 2013, DOD transferred funds into the Defense-wide Working Capital Fund. In 2012, DOD transferred $1 billion into the fund from the Afghanistan Security Forces Fund and in 2013 another $1.4 billion from various accounts, including the Foreign Currency Fluctuations account, to mitigate the cash shortfall caused by an increase in fuel costs over the standard price. DOD also transferred cash out of the fund during the period of our review. Specifically, in fiscal year 2011, Congress reduced funding for several DOD operation and maintenance accounts by about $2 billion to reflect excess cash balances in the Defense-wide Working Capital Fund. In response, DOD transferred almost $1.3 billion out of the Defense-wide Working Capital Fund to fund the reduced operation and maintenance accounts. We found that these transfers into or out of the fund can affect adjustments to the standard price. For example, according to DOD officials, the fiscal year 2013 transfer allowed DOD to maintain the same standard price throughout that year even though actual fuel costs exceeded the standard price. A DOD study noted that the fiscal year 2011 transfer out of the fund required DOD to increase its standard price by almost $40 per barrel because the cash balance in the Defense-wide Working Capital Fund was no longer sufficient to mitigate the increased costs of fuel in that year. DOD also used changes to the standard price to manage the cash balance in the Defense-wide Working Capital Fund. From the beginning of fiscal year 2009 through end of fiscal year 2013, DOD adjusted its standard price 13 times—increasing it 6 times and decreasing it 7 times. According to DOD, these price changes were due to changing product costs, approved transfers, and the availability of cash balances in the fund. For example, the fiscal year 2012 President’s Budget estimated a standard price of $131.04. However, in October 2011, DOD raised the standard price to $165.90. It then lowered the price to $160.44 in January 2012, to $151.20 in June 2012 and finally to $97.02 in July 2012, where the price remained for the rest of the fiscal year. Figure 6 shows the transfers and standard prices during fiscal years 2009 through 2013 and the cash balances in the Defense-wide Working Capital Fund. Standard price adjustments affect the military services. According to DOD officials, an adjustment to the standard price is not their preferred option for managing the fund’s cash balances because of the potential strain it places on the services’ budgets. For example, a Navy official told us that when the standard price is increased, the Navy must either reduce consumption by curtailing training or request additional funding. Fiscal year 2013 was the first year since 2004 during which DOD maintained its standard price for the entire year. DOD has studied various aspects of its bulk fuel program since 2004, but it has not updated its current approach for setting the standard price to reflect current market conditions or documented its rationale for the assumptions it uses in estimating the standard price—even though the differences between its estimated and actual costs have been considerable since that time. Since 2004, DOD has completed a number of studies reviewing various aspects of its bulk fuel program, including studies of its management of working capital funds. We identified six studies related to DOD bulk fuel pricing and management of the Defense-wide Working Capital Fund. See appendix II for a description of the purpose of the studies and any identified findings, including the status on any proposed recommendations. The John Warner National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2007 required the Secretary of Defense to submit a report on fuel rate and the cost projections used in the DOD budget presentation. In response, DOD completed a study in February 2007 that compared the crude oil forecast provided by OMB with crude oil forecasts developed by the Department of Energy and 38 private forecasting companies. Based on its analysis, DOD elected to maintain its current approach—using OMB’s WTI forecast as its preferred baseline—because the study concluded that OMB’s forecasts were comparable to or better at estimating the actual crude oil price than the alternative forecasts it evaluated. More recently, in January 2012, in response to the Ike Skelton National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2011, the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller) reviewed alternatives for managing the balances of the Defense-wide Working Capital Fund. The study found that fuel cost volatility poses a major threat to the fund’s solvency. As a result, the study concluded that DOD may need to request funding transfers that could disrupt investment programs or threaten readiness. The study recommended two alternatives for managing working capital funds. The first would allow DOD to transfer expiring unobligated balances from other appropriation accounts into the fund to build a cash reserve. The study noted that this alternative is similar to authorities provided to other federal agencies’ working capital funds, but that it would require statutory authorization. The second alternative would allow the fund to accumulate and reserve funds in times of positive cash flow—up to $12.5 billion, or two times the largest cash shortfall on record. The Office of the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller) identified several concerns with this alternative. For example, according to the study, DOD would need congressional authorization to accumulate positive operating results. Additionally, the study noted that maintaining a large cash balance in the fund to mitigate potential price risk is not a productive use of resources. According to DOD officials, DOD’s Financial Management Regulation is currently being updated with an estimated issuance of summer 2014 to allow for greater flexibility in developing cash balance targets for the Defense-wide Working Capital Fund. The 2012 study also listed other alternatives for managing working capital fund balances, which it did not recommend due to certain limitations, risks, and costs. These included some alternatives that had previously been studied and recommended by the Defense Business Board. For example, the Defense Business Board had previously studied the feasibility of hedging fuel on the open market, which includes purchasing financial instruments to minimize risk in future prices. However, according to the study, DOD has elected not to pursue hedging for a number of reasons including that it is outside of DOD’s current authority, would incur management fees that would increase total costs, and poses additional political and economic risk. The 2012 study also rejected the Defense Business Board’s recommendations to implement firm-fixed- price fuel contracts and to partner with the Department of the Interior to access additional funds when fuel costs increase. The study noted that firm-fixed-price contracts would shift pricing risk to the supplier, which would be likely to result in DOD paying a premium for the contracts. According to GAO’s Cost Estimating and Assessment Guide, a cost estimate should be updated regularly to reflect significant changes—such as changes to assumptions—and actual costs, so that it always reflects current conditions. Also, according to the guide, major assumptions should be assessed to determine how sensitive they are to changes, and risk and uncertainty analysis should be performed to determine the level of risk associated with the estimate. Further, OMB guidance states that agencies should consider the effect that demographic, economic, or other changes can have on assumptions for program levels beyond the budget year. However, the assumptions that DOD uses for setting the crude oil component of the standard price do not reflect current market conditions. Specifically, DOD’s assumptions do not consider (1) differences between crude oil benchmarks, (2) differences between domestic and international crude oil prices, and (3) the decreasing relationship between crude oil and refined prices. DOD’s approach for establishing the standard price has not accounted for changes in market conditions for crude oil. As discussed earlier in this report, DOD’s process of adding a refinement markup to the price of WTI in setting the standard price has resulted in estimated fuel costs that have been considerably lower than actual fuel costs. We found that, from fiscal years 2010 through 2013, the price for WTI diverged from other crude oil pricing benchmarks. According to a report from the Energy Information Administration, WTI was selling during this period for less than other crude oil pricing benchmarks, such as Brent—a commonly used crude oil benchmark. The price spread between WTI and Brent reached a high of $27 per barrel in September 2011, as shown in figure 7. Energy Information Administration officials also told us that, although the price spread between Brent and WTI has narrowed recently, they believe that the relationship between the pricing of Brent and WTI may remain volatile and that a price spread between the two benchmarks will likely continue. In its April 2014 Short-Term Energy Outlook, the Energy Information Administration estimates that in calendar year 2015 the price of WTI will be about $11 per barrel less than the price of Brent. Recognizing this market change, other federal agencies have adjusted their crude oil benchmarks for estimating energy prices because of this price spread. For example, in its 2013 Annual Energy Outlook, the Energy Information Administration shifted from WTI to Brent for estimating energy prices. According to officials from the Energy Information Administration, Brent crude oil prices have become the primary international crude oil benchmark. Furthermore, these officials noted that worldwide petroleum product prices—including in the United States—are typically based on Brent prices. This is consistent with DLA’s analysis, which found that domestic refined fuel products are more closely related with Brent than with WTI prices. OMB has also accounted for other crude oil benchmarks in its annual economic assumptions that are provided to federal agencies for budgeting purposes. According to officials from DOD and OMB, beginning with the fiscal year 2014 budget cycle, OMB began providing DOD and other federal agencies with forecasted Brent prices in addition to WTI prices. OMB officials told us that although OMB Circular A-11 requires that federal agencies’ budget estimates be consistent with OMB’s economic assumptions, DOD has discretion over which economic assumptions, such as an appropriate crude oil benchmark, to apply in developing its bulk fuel estimates. We identified other market conditions that DOD has not accounted for with its current approach to determining the crude oil component of the standard price. For example, DLA purchases about half of its fuel from overseas refiners. From fiscal years 2009 through 2013, DLA purchased, on average, 48 percent of its fuel from overseas sources. However, WTI is a pricing benchmark only for domestic crude oil. Because DOD uses WTI, its baseline for setting the standard price does not account for any potential price differences between domestic and overseas purchases. Furthermore, officials at DOD also expressed concerns that crude oil may no longer be a good indicator for refined product prices. According to an official from the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller), in recent years the relationship between crude oil prices and the price of DOD refined products has not been as closely related as it has in the past. This is consistent with our own analysis. Specifically, for fiscal years 2009 through 2013 we compared the actual price DLA paid for fuel with the actual price of other fuel products—including WTI crude oil, Brent crude oil, and commercial jet fuel—to determine the relationship among these prices. Based on our analysis of data from the Energy Information Administration, we found that in each year the prices DLA paid for fuel had a closer relationship with commercial jet fuel prices than with either WTI or Brent crude oil prices. To compensate for the limitations in its crude oil baseline, DOD has adjusted other components of its standard price. For example, as discussed earlier in this report, beginning in fiscal year 2013, DOD increased the refinement markup component of the standard price from 30 percent to 50 percent to account for the divergence between WTI and other crude oil pricing benchmarks. DOD has continued to use the 50 percent refinement markup in setting its standard price for fiscal years 2014 and 2015. This practice means that DOD is using the markup not only to account for refinement costs, but to cover the price spread between WTI and other crude oil pricing benchmarks. By using the increased refinement markup to compensate for the price spread, DOD is not addressing the underlying limitations with its crude oil baseline. Rather, DOD is adding further risk and uncertainty concerning its estimate, because the estimate must now account for additional price variables. Even though in recent years its methodology has been producing estimates that differ significantly from actual costs, DOD has not reevaluated its approach or documented the rationale behind the assumptions it uses for setting the standard price. DOD’s 2007 study found that its forecasting methodology produced results as good as or better than the forecasting models the study compared it with. However, that study focused exclusively on the crude oil component of the standard price. It did not evaluate the accuracy of the standard price methodology as a whole against other potential approaches. Moreover, since that time, DOD has not reevaluated whether using WTI as its baseline assumption—with the corresponding refinement markup—is still appropriate given recent market changes. Further, DOD has not considered whether a crude oil baseline is still reasonable at all. Officials from the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller) told us that they have held internal discussions regarding changing the crude oil pricing baseline used in the standard price, but no final decision has been made. Furthermore, DOD has not fully documented its rationale and assumptions for establishing each component of the standard price. GAO’s Cost Estimating and Assessment Guide states that a cost estimate should be supported by detailed documentation that describes how it was derived. According to the guide, the documentation should include, among other things, the estimating methodology used to derive the costs for each element of the cost estimate, and it should also discuss any limitations of the data or assumptions. Further, a well-documented methodology allows decision makers to understand and evaluate the budget request and make proper determinations. According to an official from the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller) responsible for overseeing DOD’s bulk fuel program, DOD’s Financial Management Regulation provides overarching guidance on establishing prices for working capital fund products, including fuel. Specifically, the Financial Management Regulation provides that all business areas of the fund are required to set their prices based upon full cost recovery, including general and administrative support provided by others. This official noted that DOD’s process for setting the standard price is based on this full cost recovery, as described in specific guidance in the Financial Management Regulation. Additionally, federal guidance also governs aspects of the rate-setting process. For example, OMB’s A-11 Circular requires DOD’s budget estimates for fuel to be consistent with OMB’s economic assumptions. For this reason the official stated that the establishment of a more specific methodology could be potentially redundant to the existing process, and could add additional administrative hurdles that may not add value. However, while DOD’s Financial Management Regulation provides overall principles for working capital funds, it does not require DOD to document its methodology for setting the standard price in a step-by-step process. Therefore, DOD does not have detailed documentation that describes the rationale for the assumptions it uses. For example, DOD has not documented its rationale for continuing to select WTI as a crude oil benchmark in establishing the standard price although OMB now provides more than WTI crude oil forecasts in its economic assumptions. Also, according to the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller) official, DOD determines its refinement markup to account for the fact that DLA purchases refined product and does not buy crude oil and that this factor is developed based on current commodity market experience balanced against DOD priorities. However, DOD has not documented its rationale or assumptions for determining these trade-offs. Reevaluating its approach for estimating the components of the standard price would allow DOD to develop more informed estimates and better position DOD to minimize risks and uncertainty resulting from changing market conditions. Further, documenting the rationale for its assumptions would provide greater transparency and clarify for fuel customers and decision makers the process DOD uses to set the standard price. DOD has faced challenges in setting a standard price that closely approximates its actual fuel costs, and in recent years its estimated fuel prices have differed considerably from its actual costs. Actual prices have differed from DOD’s estimates largely because changes in fuel market conditions have not been reflected in the standard price. Additionally, DOD has not documented its rationale for continuing to use the same assumptions. The Defense-wide Working Capital Fund, designed to absorb the effects of price fluctuations, has been insufficient to absorb the significant net outlays for fuel. This has led to large transfers into the fund from other DOD accounts and adjustments to the standard price DOD charges to customers—disrupting other DOD programs and straining the military services’ budgets. Despite the recurring need for these transfers and price adjustments, DOD has not reevaluated its approach to setting the standard price since 2007. Until DOD has reevaluated its approach and documented its assumptions for setting the standard price, it may not be certain that its price reflects current conditions. To improve DOD’s process for setting its standard fuel price, we recommend that the Secretary of Defense direct the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller), in coordination with the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA), to take the following two actions: reevaluate the approach for estimating the components of the standard price and document its assumptions, including providing detailed rationale for how it estimates each of these components. We provided a draft of this report to DOD, OMB, and the Energy Information Administration for review and comment. DOD provided written comments, which are summarized below and reprinted in appendix III. In its comments, DOD concurred with the first recommendation and partially concurred with the second recommendation. OMB and the Energy Information Administration did not provide comments on the draft report. DOD concurred with the first recommendation that the Secretary of Defense direct the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller), in coordination with DLA, to reevaluate DOD’s approach for estimating the components of the standard price. In its comments, DOD stated that this is an ongoing effort within the department and that the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller) and DLA are continually evaluating methods to better estimate the price of fuel. DOD stated that this is a challenge because the rate-setting process takes place a budget cycle in advance of execution. DOD noted that fuel-market volatility affects the Working Capital Fund’s ability to budget for, and customers’ ability to buy, fuel at a stabilized price. Additionally, in its comments, DOD stated that the department does not have the storage capacity to hold a year’s worth of fuel in advance, so fuel is purchased in real time throughout the execution year and sold at a price set 18 months prior. We agree that the rate-setting process is challenging, given the timing of DOD’s budget process and when the department actually purchases fuel. However, as stated in the report, DOD’s current approach for establishing the standard price has not accounted for changes in market conditions for crude oil, such as the decreasing relationship between crude oil and refined prices, even though its methodology has been producing estimates that differ greatly from actual costs. Although DOD noted in its comments that it is continually evaluating methods to better estimate the price of fuel, it did not specify any specific initiatives to that end. Moreover, the report did not identify any studies that DOD has undertaken since 2004 that constitute a reevaluation of the department’s approach for estimating the components of the standard price. Reevaluating its approach for estimating the components of the standard price would allow DOD to develop more- informed estimates and better position the department to minimize risks and uncertainty resulting from changing market conditions. DOD partially concurred with the second recommendation that the Secretary of Defense direct the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller), in coordination with DLA, to document its assumptions, including providing a detailed rationale for how it estimates each of the standard price components. In its comments, DOD stated that the department does not have a “documented” specific, step-by-step process to develop the fuel price. DOD further stated that it prices fuel by using a formal process that has been presented to the department’s leadership, briefed to congressional staffers, discussed with the administration, and reproduced in various instructional and informational briefings and papers. In its comments, DOD stated that the process for setting the fuel price is similar to other Working Capital Fund products and follows the intent of DOD’s Financial Management Regulation and congressional implementing language for full cost recovery. We stated in the report that DOD’s Financial Management Regulation provides overall principles for working capital funds, but it does not require DOD to document its methodology for setting the standard price in a step-by-step process. Therefore, DOD does not have detailed documentation that describes the rationale for the assumptions it uses, such as its rationale for selecting one crude oil benchmark over another benchmark or the factors and other tradeoffs that it considers when establishing the refinement markup. GAO’s Cost Estimating and Assessment Guide states that a cost estimate should be supported by detailed documentation that describes how it was derived. According to the guide, the documentation should include, among other things, the estimating methodology used to derive the costs for each element of the cost estimate, and it should also discuss any limitations of the data or assumptions. Documenting DOD’s assumptions, including the rationale for each component of the standard price, would provide greater transparency and clarify for fuel customers and decision makers the process DOD uses to set the standard price.

GAO staff who made key contributors to this report are listed in appendix IV. To address our objectives, we focused our analysis on fiscal years 2009 through 2013. We focused on these years because this period covered the most recent complete year of the Department of Defense’s (DOD) fuel sales and provided 5 years of cost data to analyze any trends. To determine how estimated bulk fuel costs have compared with actual costs since fiscal year 2009 and identify the factors that contributed to any differences, we compared the estimated budget costs for fuel against actual costs in the budget year of execution and identified any differences. We calculated DOD’s estimated fuel costs by multiplying the standard price per barrel by the number of barrels the military services estimated they would consume. To calculate DOD’s actual fuel costs, we multiplied the actual purchase price per barrel by the number of barrels sold to the military services. We then determined which factors contributed to the overall differences. Specifically, we calculated the percentage of the overall difference explained by either fuel price fluctuations or differences between estimated fuel consumption and actual consumption. Next, we compared each of the three components of the standard price (crude oil price, refinement markup, and nonproduct costs—such as transportation and facilities maintenance) against the actual costs for each component to determine which one contributed most to the difference between the standard price and actual fuel costs. We also interviewed officials from the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller), the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA), the military services, and the Department of Energy’s Energy Information Administration to discuss the factors that contributed to these differences. To determine the extent to which DOD has taken actions to manage the effect of any differences between estimated and actual fuel costs, we reviewed monthly cash balances in the Defense-wide Working Capital Fund for the period October 2008 through September 2013 and determined the effect of bulk fuel purchases and sales on those balances. In doing so, we determined net outlays from the Defense-wide Working Capital Fund and compared them with the cash balance in the fund. We analyzed DOD financial management documents for this same period to determine the number and amount of approved transfer actions related to fuel into and out of the Defense-wide Working Capital Fund and any fuel- related supplemental appropriations received into the fund. In addition, we analyzed DOD budget-justification materials and other documentation to identify all changes to DOD’s standard price. We also interviewed officials from DOD and the military services to determine the effect on the services’ budgets of transfers and changes to the standard price. To determine the extent to which DOD has considered options for adjusting its approach for estimating bulk fuel costs and managing working capital funds, we reviewed related studies and recommendations that we identified through interviews with DOD officials and literature searches that discuss options available to DOD to adjust its approach to managing bulk fuel costs and working capital funds. For this review we focused on relevant studies that have been conducted since 2004. We interviewed DOD officials to determine the status of any findings and recommendations from these studies related to DOD’s bulk fuel pricing or management of the Defense-wide Working Capital Fund. We also reviewed documentation that describes DOD’s current approach for estimating bulk fuel costs, including budget-justification materials and DOD reports, and discussed the department’s approach with officials from the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller), DLA, and the Office of Management and Budget. We compared this information with cost-estimating practices established in GAO’s Cost Estimating and Assessment Guide and Office of Management and Budget and DOD guidance. We also interviewed officials from DOD, the Office of Management and Budget, and the Department of Energy to discuss current fuel market conditions and alternative approaches to estimating bulk fuel costs and reviewed Department of Energy reports describing current fuel market conditions. To better understand the fuel market conditions, we reviewed DLA fuel purchase data for fiscal years 2009 through 2013 and compared the amount of domestic fuel purchases with the amount of international fuel purchases. We also performed analysis on the relationship of the West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil benchmark with other crude oil pricing benchmarks to determine whether DOD’s approach to setting its standard price reflects current market conditions. Further, we conducted an analysis on the relationship of crude oil prices with refined product costs, including the cost of commercial jet fuel. To determine the reliability of the fuel cost data provided to us by DOD, we obtained information on how the data were collected, managed, and used through interviews with and questionnaires to relevant officials. We assessed the reliability of the data collected by analyzing questionnaire responses from Office of the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller) and DLA officials, which included information on their data system management, data quality-assurance processes, and potential sources of errors and mitigations of those errors. To determine the reliability of monthly cash balances in the Defense-wide Working Capital Fund, we (1) obtained and analyzed reports containing detailed data on transactions affecting the Working Capital Fund cash balance including collections, disbursements, direct appropriations to the fund, and funds transferred into and out of the fund; (2) reconciled year-end cash balances between DOD reports and Department of the Treasury records; and (3) obtained and analyzed documentation supporting the amount of funds transferred in and out of the Working Capital Fund. To determine the reliability of DLA fuel purchase data, we compared DLA domestic and international fuel purchases against fuel purchase data provided in DOD’s budget- justification materials. To determine the reliability of the Energy Information Administration’s data on Brent, WTI, and commercial jet fuel prices, we reviewed information on its methodology and data quality guidelines in accordance with GAO guidance on assessing data from federal statistical databases. Based on our review of the data, we determined that the data presented in our findings were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of this report. We interviewed officials, and where appropriate obtained documentation, at the following DOD locations: Office of the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller); Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Operational Energy Defense Logistics Agency, Energy Management Activity Group; Air Force Petroleum Agency; Office of the Secretary of the Air Force, Financial Management and Army Petroleum Center; Naval Supply Systems Command; and Headquarters, Marine Corps, Programs and Resources, Operations and Maintenance Budget Formulations Branch. We also interviewed other officials from the following federal agencies and other organizations: Office of Management and Budget; Department of Energy, Energy Information Administration; and Institute for Defense Analyses. We conducted this performance audit from November 2013 to July 2014, in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. This appendix contains a list of six studies conducted since 2004 on the Department of Defense’s (DOD) bulk fuel pricing and management of the Defense-wide Working Capital Fund. Table 3 provides information on each study’s name and purpose, as well as any findings and recommendations, and DOD’s response to the recommendations or status of their implementation. Some of the studies listed below included information outside the scope of our review; however, we have only included findings and recommendations related to DOD’s bulk fuel pricing or management of the Defense-wide Working Capital Fund. In addition to the contacts named above, Gregory Pugnetti, Assistant Director; Matthew Ullengren, Assistant Director; Pedro Almoguera; Russell Bryan; Virginia Chanley; Stephen Donahue; Adam Hatton; Joanne Landesman; Amie Steele; and Michael Willems made key contributions to this report.","DOD purchases bulk fuel and sells it to customers, including the military services. Each fiscal year, DOD sets a standard price for budgeting purposes, endeavoring to closely approximate the price it will pay when it buys the fuel almost a year later. If this price is different than the standard price, DOD may need to take actions to manage its working capital funds—funds used to purchase fuel and other commodities that are reimbursed through sales. Senate Report 113-44, accompanying a bill for the National Defense Authorization Act for FY 2014, mandated GAO to review DOD's approach for establishing its bulk fuel pricing. This report discusses, among other things, (1) how estimated bulk fuel costs have compared to actual costs since FY 2009 and the factors that have contributed to any differences; and (2) the extent to which DOD has considered options for adjusting its approach to estimating bulk fuel costs and managing working capital funds in light of any differences between estimated and actual fuel costs. GAO compared estimated and actual fuel costs for FY 2009 through 2013 and analyzed DOD actions to manage working capital funds. During fiscal years 2009 through 2013, the Department of Defense's (DOD) actual costs for bulk fuel differed considerably from its budget estimates, largely because of fluctuations in fuel price in the open market. During this period, DOD underestimated its costs for 3 years and overestimated them for 2 years as shown below. GAO identified two factors that contributed to the differences between estimated and actual costs—(1) fuel price fluctuations and (2) differences between the military services' estimated fuel requirements and their actual fuel consumption. GAO's analysis showed that the differences between the price DOD paid for fuel and the price it charged its fuel customers—the standard price—accounted for, on average, 74 percent of the difference between estimated and actual costs. Specifically, of the three components of the standard price that DOD sets each fiscal year—crude oil, refinement markup, and nonproduct costs, such as transportation and facilities maintenance costs—differences in the price of crude oil accounted for most of the difference between estimated and actual fuel costs in fiscal years 2009 and 2010. In fiscal years 2011 through 2013, the refinement markup accounted for most of the difference. Differences between the services' estimated fuel requirements and actual fuel consumption accounted for an average of 26 percent of the difference between estimated and actual fuel costs. Since 2004, DOD has conducted reviews of aspects of its bulk fuel program to determine whether adjustments should be made, including managing acquisition strategies, managing working capital funds, and budgeting for cost fluctuations. However, it has not updated its approach to reflect current market conditions or documented its rationale for the assumptions it uses in estimating the standard price. GAO's Cost Estimating and Assessment Guide and Office of Management and Budget guidance state that a cost estimate should be updated regularly to reflect changes to assumptions and actual costs, so that it always reflects current conditions. Furthermore, cost estimates should be supported by detailed documentation that describes how they were derived. Reevaluating its approach for estimating the standard price would allow DOD to develop more informed estimates and better position it to minimize risks and uncertainty resulting from changing market conditions. Further, documenting the rationale for its assumptions would provide greater transparency and clarify for fuel customers and decision makers the process DOD uses to set the standard price. GAO recommends that DOD reevaluate its approach for estimating the components of the standard price and document the rationale for its assumptions. DOD agreed with the first recommendation and partially agreed with the second stating there is a closely-monitored, formal process.

"The rapid and widespread increase in the use of crack—a smokable form of cocaine—in the 1980s has frequently been referred to as a drug epidemic. To identify emerging drug use problems, researchers and government agencies look for changing patterns in drug use, some of which may signal the onset of an epidemic. Primary among these patterns are the use of a new illicit drug; a change in how a drug is taken, such as smoking rather than inhaling—or “snorting”—cocaine; a change in the level of use of an existing drug among populations that routinely abuse drugs; and the use of a drug by a new population group or in a different geographic area. Some experts argue that national drug epidemics are rare, and many agree that local areas more frequently experience emerging drug crises or epidemics before they spread. Many federal agencies fund activities and programs that implement the nation’s drug control strategy (see app. II). According to ONDCP, about 25 percent of federal drug control resources are for grants-in-aid or other forms of assistance provided to state and local governments and private entities, which commingle such funds with resources from other sources. In fiscal year 1997, federal funding for drug control efforts was over $15 billion, and the fiscal year 1998 request was for $16 billion. The President has requested about $17 billion in funding for fiscal year 1999. About two-thirds of federal drug control funds are channeled into efforts to reduce the supply of illicit drugs; the remaining one-third supports efforts to reduce drug demand. The Department of Justice obtains the largest proportion—about 45 percent—and HHS gets about 16 percent. Within HHS, NIDA and SAMHSA currently have primary responsibility for health-related drug control problems. The Drug Abuse Office and Treatment Act of 1972 (P.L. 92-255) created NIDA (effective in 1974) and gave it broad responsibilities over most aspects of drug research, prevention, and treatment activities. Essentially, NIDA was responsible for planning and administering drug abuse prevention, treatment, and rehabilitation programs and for developing and conducting comprehensive research and research training (teaching professionals about conducting substance abuse research). The act also gave NIDA responsibility for creating a national community-based treatment system to respond to the drug abuse problem. In 1974, the same year NIDA was established, ADAMHA was created as an umbrella agency to oversee the functions and operations of NIDA and two other research institutes. In 1981, ADAMHA was given additional responsibility for (1) administering demonstration programs related to the prevention and treatment of alcohol and drug abuse and mental health disorders and (2) providing assistance and information about such disorders to other federal agencies, states, health care providers, and public and private organizations. The Alcohol, Drug Abuse, and Mental Health Services (ADMS) block grant program was also created in 1981 to provide funds to states for planning, establishing, and evaluating programs for the development of more effective prevention, treatment, and rehabilitation services. In 1992, the ADAMHA Reorganization Act (P.L. 102-321) created a new agency, SAMHSA, to replace ADAMHA and transferred NIDA and the two other research institutes to NIH. NIDA retained primary responsibility for substance abuse research activities, while SAMHSA assumed primary responsibility for the service programs and some drug use detection functions. SAMHSA also assumed responsibility for overseeing state administration of the block grant programs. In the 1970s, NIDA sponsored several surveys and convened a work group of epidemiologists from cities around the country to help identify and monitor changes in drug use patterns. Through these mechanisms, NIDA was able to detect that cocaine was being smoked as well as snorted—the more common method of cocaine use up to that time. This change was later associated with the emergence of the crack epidemic. NIDA was not able to collect information on the national prevalence of crack use in the general household population until the late 1980s because the survey NIDA used to collect these data was not conducted annually and did not allow for timely reporting of crack use. There also were other limitations in the drug detection mechanisms NIDA used. In the 1970s and 1980s, NIDA sponsored four major ongoing drug detection mechanisms: the National Household Survey on Drug Abuse (NHSDA), Monitoring the Future (MTF), the Drug Abuse Warning Network (DAWN), and the Community Epidemiology Work Group (CEWG). (For other drug use detection mechanisms sponsored by public health and law enforcement agencies before the mid-1980s, see app. III.) While the drug detection mechanisms were designed to collect information on the use of a variety of drugs, including cocaine, they generally targeted different populations and covered different geographic locations and time periods. A description of the drug detection mechanisms NIDA sponsored follows. NHSDA, a nationally representative household survey established in 1972, was used to estimate drug use in the general population on the basis of a sample of permanent household members aged 12 and older. The survey was administered periodically, generally every 2 to 3 years, and covered past-month, past-year, and lifetime use of more than 10 drug types. MTF, a nationally representative survey established in 1975 and administered annually to 12th-grade students, measured drug use, attitudes toward drugs, and perceptions about their availability and ability to harm. Like NHSDA, it covered past-month, past-year, and lifetime use of more than 10 drug types. DAWN, established in 1972 by the Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) and transferred to NIDA in 1980, initially comprised a random sample of hospital emergency departments within selected metropolitan areas and medical examiners in metropolitan areas who volunteered to participate. Emergency department information captured types of drugs used, motives for use, and whether the patient was treated. Medical examiner data also captured drug type, as well as the form in which the drug was used and whether the use was accidental or intentional. CEWG, established in 1976, was originally composed of epidemiologists from 18 major metropolitan areas. Three other metropolitan areas were later added. The group was established to provide ongoing community-level surveillance of drug use through the collection and analysis of epidemiologic and ethnographic (culture-related) data. Changes in drug use patterns are often captured by CEWG through its use of law-enforcement surveillance data, street surveillance, and other local public health drug detection sources. Between the 1970s and early 1980s, NIDA tracked the change in cocaine use through information reported by DAWN and CEWG. This change in drug use pattern (from only snorting to also smoking cocaine) would later be recognized as an early warning sign of the emergence of crack cocaine. From DAWN data, NIDA found that, between 1976 and 1982, cocaine smoking accounted for about 2 percent of cocaine-related emergency department episodes; however, by 1985, cocaine smoking accounted for 8 percent of such episodes. It was not until the late 1980s, however, that adjustments were made to DAWN data that differentiated between freebasing—another form of cocaine smoking—and crack cocaine smoking. Moreover, CEWG began reporting increased use of smokable cocaine in three major cities as early as 1981. In 1985—when crack first became generally recognized as a specific form of smokable cocaine—crack use was reported to have spread to at least seven of the CEWG coverage areas. Just 1 year later, CEWG reported that crack use had spread to 17 of the metropolitan areas covered. Although NIDA was aware of the rapid spread of crack use from CEWG reports starting in the mid-1980s, the national prevalence of crack use in the general household population was not measured until the late 1980s. (Prevalence of use data are utilized, in part, by decisionmakers to establish drug control policy.) The 1985 NHSDA did not include questions specific to crack use. Because the survey is conducted generally every 2 to 3 years, questions about crack were not included until the 1988 survey. As a result, survey data on the national prevalence of crack use were not available until 1989—3 years after reports of the spread of crack to 17 major metropolitan areas. Results from NHSDA showed that about 1 percent of household populations had used crack in the past year. In two congressional hearings held in July 1986, a number of concerns were raised about the data that had been collected through the NIDA-sponsored drug detection mechanisms. Specifically, NHSDA data showed a leveling off of cocaine use nationally, while other sources were indicating that local areas were experiencing epidemic use of the drug. There was also a lack of data on crack use in the general population. In addition, the latest NHSDA data being reported had been collected 4 years earlier, in 1982. These and other concerns about the adequacy of drug use data reflected key limitations in each of the NIDA-sponsored mechanisms used to measure drug use. Specifically, there were gaps in populations surveyed that affected NIDA’s prevalence of drug use estimates. For example, NHSDA excluded institutionalized and homeless populations. Similarly, high school dropouts—another high-risk population—were excluded from MTF, thereby potentially lowering national drug use estimates. NHSDA and MTF also relied on self-reported drug use data, which were not validated. There were also potential limitations in DAWN—one of the mechanisms used to identify early warning signs of emerging drugs. For example, since DAWN relied on hospital emergency personnel to record patient mentions of substance abuse, there was concern about the accuracy of the data, given the typically fast pace in hospital emergency departments. In addition, there were concerns that, by the mid-1980s, DAWN no longer provided a representative sample of emergency departments, since many of the hospitals that had participated in DAWN had either merged, closed down, or dropped out of the study. Moreover, while CEWG was instrumental in reporting early warning signs of crack use in the metropolitan areas it covered, it did not collect and report information on rural areas or cities with smaller population bases. The federal public health response to crack in the 1980s primarily focused on cocaine in general instead of on crack specifically. NIDA’s research was aimed at developing “best practice” prevention and treatment approaches. The agency also launched several education and outreach efforts specific to cocaine. Up to the late 1980s, there was no significant change in block grant funding for state drug prevention and service delivery activities. Federal involvement in service delivery was through ADAMHA’s oversight of state administration of the ADMS block grant until congressional actions changed the organization within ADAMHA to focus more on administering prevention and treatment programs. NIDA’s research activities related to prevention and treatment practices did not make clear distinctions between powdered cocaine and its crystallized form, crack. According to NIDA officials, the agency did not see a need to differentiate treatment practices for powder cocaine and crack or to develop separate prevention approaches for each of these drugs. NIDA officials stated that results from later research on efficacy of treatment for cocaine and crack cocaine showed that similar treatments were effective for both forms of cocaine. NIDA’s research activities included testing medications for reducing cocaine craving and withdrawal symptoms. The agency also investigated approaches for treating cocaine abuse, such as family therapy, group psychotherapy, and therapeutic communities. As with its research efforts, NIDA did not initially target its education and outreach efforts to address the use of crack. In the 1980s, as concerns about cocaine use increased, NIDA developed several public education campaigns against drug use in general and cocaine use in particular. The Drug Abuse Prevention Media Campaign, launched in 1983, was targeted to people aged 18 to 35 and was intended to motivate parents to learn about drugs, talk to their children about problems associated with drug use, and join with other parents to fight drug abuse in their communities. The initiative also sought to help young people resist peer pressure and to just say “no” to drugs, which became the theme of the campaign. In 1985, NIDA introduced a second phase of this campaign that targeted inner-city youth aged 10 to 14 and their families. In 1986, NIDA launched “Cocaine: The Big Lie,” a public education campaign that focused on the dangers of cocaine and specifically targeted young adults, aged 18 to 35, in college and the workplace. The following year, the campaign targeted crack as well as cocaine, sponsoring discussions of the effects of crack on the brain and respiratory and cardiovascular systems, as well as available treatments. NIDA also established a national cocaine treatment hot line in 1985 to provide a toll-free referral service for people addicted to cocaine and their families who sought treatment or counseling as well as educational information about illicit drugs. Within the first year of operation, more than 50,000 calls were received. In addition, NIDA sponsored two national conferences, one in 1986 and one in 1987, that collectively included sessions on drug abuse prevention, research, and treatment. The purpose of these conferences was to share information with drug epidemiologists, health care providers, and the broader research community on the use of illicit drugs. In 1981, before crack cocaine use was considered an epidemic, the Congress consolidated its categorical and formula grant programs into a substance abuse and mental health block grant to give states greater flexibility in their use of funds for prevention and treatment activities. This ADMS block grant program in effect limited the federal role in service delivery to overseeing the administration of the program and providing less direct assistance to states. The 1982 initial appropriation for the ADMS block grant was $428 million—a decrease of about 26 percent from the prior year’s appropriation for the categorical programs. Total funding of the ADMS block grant program varied by less than 10 percent from fiscal years 1982 through 1988. However, starting in fiscal year 1989, a greater proportion of block grant funding began to shift to substance abuse. From fiscal year 1988 to fiscal year 1992, the allocation of ADMS block grant funds for substance abuse increased from 51 percent of the total ADMS funding to 80 percent, as the proportion for mental health decreased. Over this period, funding for substance abuse increased from $249 million to more than $1 billion. Some of the concerns raised at the July 1986 congressional hearings on crack cocaine focused on the adequacy of federal responsiveness to drug use problems. With the creation of the ADMS block grant program, NIDA no longer had a leadership role in deciding with the states what prevention and treatment activities to fund. While many in the research community welcomed this change, others felt it left a gap in federal leadership for prevention and treatment services. Under the previous categorical and formula grant programs, the federal government directly funded specific demonstration programs related to prevention and treatment services. With the creation of the ADMS block grant, however, states were given the flexibility to design and fund programs specific to the needs of their local communities. However, this change resulted in a smaller federal role in deciding which drug abuse services to fund in a given geographic area. Despite this shift, service-related constituency groups continued to look to ADAMHA, which had been given responsibility for overseeing state administration of the block grant, for national leadership on substance abuse policy issues. To focus more on service programs at the federal level, the Congress authorized additional demonstration and service programs for special populations to be administered by ADAMHA. ADAMHA’s Office of Substance Abuse Prevention (OSAP)—which was established by the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986 to strengthen the federal role in effective drug abuse prevention—began awarding demonstration grants to community agencies to provide prevention services to youth at high risk of substance abuse. The Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988 (P.L. 100-690) raised OSAP to a status equal to ADAMHA’s institutes and authorized demonstrations that would support, among other efforts, a major prevention services program for substance-abusing pregnant women and improved treatment for substance abusers. The act also authorized, for the first time, a federal set-aside from the ADMS block grant program to be used by ADAMHA to conduct service demonstrations and health services research and to collect data and provide technical assistance to states. The 1988 legislation also resulted in the creation of the Office for Treatment Improvement (OTI) to administer many of these new programs as well as the ADMS block grant program. To better identify and monitor changes in drug use activity, including potential crises such as the crack cocaine epidemic experienced in the 1980s, NIDA modified its drug detection mechanisms, and new federal mechanisms were created. The modifications and additions aimed at addressing some of the coverage, timeliness, and methodological concerns raised by the Congress and others. The creation of ONDCP and organizational changes to HHS’ drug abuse agencies since the late 1980s were intended to strengthen the federal response to drug abuse problems. The Anti-Drug Abuse Act created ONDCP and charged it with, among other things, developing and coordinating a national drug control strategy. SAMHSA was created 4 years later and charged with establishing and implementing a comprehensive program to improve the provision of prevention- and treatment-related services for substance abuse. At the same time, NIDA was transferred to NIH to allow NIDA to concentrate on research, research training, and public health information dissemination related to the prevention and treatment of drug abuse. Recognizing the need to improve research on the infrastructure that delivers treatment, the Congress mandated in 1992 that NIDA obligate at least 15 percent of its budget to fund research that studies the impact of the organization, financing, and management of health services on issues such as access and quality of services. While these changes were intended to strengthen the federal ability to detect and respond to changing drug use patterns, the effectiveness of these changes will depend largely on how well the agencies carry out their roles and responsibilities. Under the Government Performance and Results Act of 1993 (the Results Act) federal agencies are required to set goals, measure performance, and report on the degree to which the goals are met. The legislation was enacted to increase program effectiveness and public accountability by having federal agencies focus on results and service quality. During the crack crisis of the 1980s, limitations in the drug detection system hampered the identification and monitoring of drug use activity in many geographic areas and for some high-risk populations. Timely analysis and dissemination of drug use prevalence data were also problems. Since the mid-1980s, a number of changes have been made to the drug use detection mechanisms to address some surveillance and monitoring limitations. New information sources have also been added. (For many of the drug detection mechanisms now available to the federal public health service agencies and others, see app. III.) The changes to the NIDA-sponsored drug use detection mechanisms were intended to improve geographic and population coverage and timeliness of drug use data. To obtain and help ensure a representative sample of hospital emergency departments in DAWN, a new representative sample was drawn and provisions were made for including new hospitals in the sampling frame each year. Adjustments for nonresponse patterns were also made. MTF was expanded to include a representative sample of 8th- and 10th-grade students in addition to the 12th-graders and young adults already being surveyed. NHSDA was expanded to include civilians living on military bases and people living in noninstitutional quarters, such as college dormitories, rooming houses, and shelters. NHSDA was also expanded to include Alaska and Hawaii. To provide more timely national data, since 1990 NHSDA has been conducted every year, instead of every 2 to 3 years. There are also plans, promoted by ONDCP, to expand NHSDA to collect state-level drug use prevalence data. This expansion is expected to provide annual estimates for each state’s household population and, specifically, for the population aged 12 to 17 and 18 to 25. Steps were also taken toward improving the reliability of data by correcting some of the problems with drug use prevalence estimates. Drug use prevalence estimates had been dramatically affected by an estimation technique known as “logical imputation” and by weighting the estimates for certain drugs. Logical imputation calls for revising a survey participant’s initially negative drug use response if one or more subsequent responses related to the same drug are positive. For example, in the 1990 NHSDA, 40 percent, or 53 of 131 past-month positive cocaine use responses, were imputed—changed from an initial response indicating no cocaine use. The initial “no drug use” response was changed because of an apparently conflicting response to another question in the survey. Although the problem with logical imputation is still a concern, the probability of a logical imputation error in estimating drug use has been lowered somewhat by reducing the number of questions being asked about the same drug on the survey, according to SAMHSA officials. Weighted estimates of the national prevalence of drug use have also been questioned in the past, given the limited number of surveyed cocaine and heroin users from which to make projections. For example, in a study in which the 1991 NHSDA age variable was weighted to account for subject sampling probabilities and nonresponse rates, it was discovered that, when projected to the nation, one 79-year-old woman accounted for an estimated 142,000 heroin users, or about 20 percent of all people who used heroin in the past year. SAMHSA officials said that they have taken steps to try to limit such effects of weighted estimates by assessing each outlier on a case-by-case basis and using their judgment to decide when to truncate or reduce the weights. In addition to changes in DAWN, MTF, and NHSDA, several new drug use detection mechanisms have been developed. SAMHSA has cited the particular importance of two of these mechanisms: the Arrestee Drug Abuse Monitoring (ADAM) program and the Treatment Episode Data Set (TEDS). ADAM, formerly the Drug Use Forecasting program, comprises an ongoing quarterly study of the drug use patterns of new arrestees at booking facilities in approximately 20 cities across the country. TEDS is a database of substance abuse client admissions to those publicly funded substance abuse treatment programs that receive some of their funding through a state alcohol and drug agency. In commenting on this report, SAMHSA officials stated that their Violence Data Exchange Teams (VDET) are in the process of creating a local-level system to track trends and changes in substance abuse-related violence. When fully operational, VDETs will assist local communities in the detection of drug abuse patterns as they are manifested through violence-related data. SAMHSA officials believe that such data can be used to serve as an early warning system. In 1992, ONDCP initiated “Pulse Check,” a telephone survey (as well as a report of the survey results), to provide a quick and current snapshot of drug use and drug markets across the country. According to ONDCP officials, “Pulse Check,” which was initially published quarterly but was changed to a biannual report, typically includes information on the availability of drugs, their purity, and their street prices; user demographics; methods of use; and user primary drug of choice. These data are obtained from different sources, including telephone interviews with drug ethnographers and epidemiologists, law enforcement agents, drug treatment providers across the nation, and CEWG reports. ONDCP officials said that surveillance data from “Pulse Check” and other sources have increased ONDCP’s capability to perform quick analyses and special studies of changing drug use patterns as well as to identify problems in certain population groups and geographic areas. Before the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988, which created ONDCP, each federal agency involved with drug control had its own set of goals, objectives, targets, and measures, as well as congressional mandates. To coordinate the federal drug control effort, ONDCP was charged with developing an annual national drug control strategy. ONDCP’s 1997 strategy provided a common set of goals and objectives for drug control agencies to use in addressing drug use problems and included a 10-year federal commitment to reduce illicit drug use, which was supported by 5-year budgets of the participating agencies. ONDCP officials have pointed out that achieving the goals will depend not only on federal agencies but also on state, local, and foreign governments; private entities; and individuals. To assess the effectiveness of its national drug control strategy in limiting drug use, drug availability, and the consequences of drug use, ONDCP has established, in consultation with federal drug control agencies, a national performance measurement system to assess results. According to ONDCP officials, their approach to developing goals, objectives, and performance measures for the national drug control strategy is similar to the approach required by the Results Act for individual federal agencies. ONDCP has established a new program evaluation office to oversee the design and implementation of its performance measurement system over the next several years. Consistent with the Results Act, ONDCP’s fiscal year 1997 to 2002 strategic plan lists five long-range goals and objectives. Goals 1 and 3 are in part designed to reduce the demand for illegal drugs by educating and enabling youth to reject illegal drugs and to reduce the health and social costs of illegal drug use, respectively. While the objectives of goal 1 generally focus on prevention activities, a goal 3 objective is to support and promote effective, efficient, and accessible drug treatment to ensure the development of a system that is responsive to emerging trends in drug use. ONDCP’s performance targets and measures for these goals and objectives are discussed in Performance Measures of Effectiveness. Two of ONDCP’s programs focus on addressing the trend in drug use primarily among youth: a national media campaign and the Drug-Free Communities Support Program. Moreover, ONDCP has taken the initiative to help focus attention on some recent changes in drug use trends that have emerged as potentially problematic. For example, ONDCP responded to changes in methamphetamine use in certain geographic areas by publishing a special issue of “Pulse Check” on these trends and cosponsoring a methamphetamine conference. In addition, ONDCP is now developing a national methamphetamine strategy. ONDCP officials admit, however, that they have no systematic approach or strategy for specifically addressing emerging drug use problems. SAMHSA was created to address concerns related to the availability and quality of drug prevention and treatment services. Specifically, SAMHSA was to develop national goals and model programs; coordinate federal policy related to providing prevention and treatment services; and evaluate the process, outcomes, and community impact of prevention and treatment services. In addition, SAMHSA was to ensure, through coordination with NIDA, the dissemination of relevant research findings to service providers to improve the delivery and effectiveness of prevention and treatment services. To carry out these responsibilities, SAMHSA initially established demonstration grant programs that supported individual grants, cooperative agreements, and contracts. SAMHSA also assumed responsibility for administering the separate Substance Abuse Prevention and Treatment (SAPT) block grant program. In 1995, SAMHSA developed the Knowledge Development and Application (KD&A) program, consolidating SAMHSA’s individual demonstration grant programs. According to SAMHSA officials, the program offers improved ways of generating and disseminating knowledge on the prevention and treatment of problems related to drug use and how to apply that knowledge to delivering services. In fiscal year 1997, 17.4 percent of SAMHSA’s budget was devoted to KD&A program activities. Since fiscal year 1992 when the SAPT block grant was established, funding for substance abuse has continued to increase. SAPT block grant funds to states gradually increased from about $1.04 billion in fiscal year 1993 to more than $1.15 billion in fiscal year 1996. In fiscal year 1997, the funding increased by $126 million. According to SAMHSA officials, the agency is not yet adequately positioned to deter emerging drug use that might result in future epidemics. They told us that the SAPT block grant, which currently comprises 60 percent of SAMHSA’s funding, is not designed to provide a rapid response to emerging drug problems. They also stated that it is difficult to determine when an increase in a certain type of drug use warrants attention and the type of response needed. SAMHSA officials said, however, that they have planned several initiatives to address emerging drug use trends. For example, CSAP plans to continue its support of the HHS Secretary’s Youth Substance Abuse Prevention Initiative—including budgeting $5.0 million for two new State Incentive Grant (SIG) programs. SIGs are competitive grants to states to coordinate disparate funding streams and facilitate the development of effective local drug prevention strategies targeted to youth. These programs serve as an incentive for governors to examine and synchronize statewide prevention strategies with private and community-based organizations. Additionally, CSAT plans to test the feasibility of implementing new approaches in treatment settings. For example, more individuals— particularly on the West Coast and in the Southwest—are seeking treatment for methamphetamine dependence; but, according to CSAT, there are no well-established treatment approaches for this drug. CSAT’s Replicating Effective Treatment for Methamphetamine Dependence study is designed to develop knowledge of psychosocial treatment for methamphetamine dependence as well as to provide an opportunity to determine the problems involved in transferring this knowledge. To help states put the infrastructure in place to respond to emerging drug use trends, CSAT plans to further strengthen its partnerships with state and local governments as well as with community-based treatment providers and the private sector to solve common problems. For example, the Targeted Treatment Capacity Expansion Program is designed to award grants to states, cities, and other government entities to create and expand comprehensive substance abuse treatment services and promote accountability. CSAT plans to support states, cities, and other partners in their efforts to identify gaps in the delivery system and, where current capacity within a treatment modality is insufficient, provide for expanded access to treatment. In an effort to disseminate information to service providers and others, SAMHSA operates the National Clearinghouse for Alcohol and Drug Information. SAMHSA, NIDA, and other public health agencies provide posters, brochures, reports, booklets, audiotapes, and videotapes to aid in drug abuse prevention and awareness efforts. Under the Results Act, HHS is required to show that the use of federal funds is yielding results by measuring how well HHS’ programs and efforts are working. In HHS’ fiscal year 1999 Results Act performance plan, however, SAMHSA does not provide sufficient information about how it plans to meet some of its performance goals. For example, under the general goal of providing funding to states in support of the public sector substance abuse treatment system, one performance measure is to increase to 80 percent the proportion of block grant applications that include needs assessment data. However, SAMHSA provides no information about the strategies it will use to increase the proportion of states that will include needs assessment data or how the validity of the data will be assessed. Further, SAMHSA’s performance plan does not mention how it will address emerging drug use problems. With its transfer to NIH, NIDA was relieved of most of its direct service delivery functions with the intent of having it focus on conducting research on drug abuse and addiction. However, according to NIDA officials, the nature of research and the research grant approval process (which is often lengthy) limits the agency’s immediate response to emerging drug problems. That is, it takes time to generate grants in a new priority area, conduct the research, publicize the research findings, and move these findings from the “lab” into practice. NIDA has a key role to play both in generating research-based prevention and treatment approaches and in training research scientists who potentially can be useful to the public health community in addressing drug control problems. The move to NIH also gave NIDA the opportunity to focus more on developing initiatives in public education and research training. According to ONDCP’s National Drug Control Strategy, 1977, NIDA’s ongoing research portfolio supports more than 85 percent of the world’s research on the health aspects of drug abuse and addiction. Most of the NIDA-funded research is conducted through extramural research programs. However, a portion of NIDA’s resources is dedicated to its intramural program—that is, research conducted by NIDA researchers. Currently, NIDA’s research activities are organized into four extramural research divisions and an intramural research program, each of which plays a role in addressing issues relevant to emerging drug problems. For example, both the intramural research program and the Division of Clinical and Services Research are investigating the relationship of brain functions (through neuroimaging techniques) to drug craving. Results of such research may be useful in helping drug users reduce the craving or need for specific illicit drugs. NIDA’s Division of Medications Development has been investigating the utility of cocaine medications for the treatment of users of methamphetamine as well as examining the clinical utility of buprenorphine to reduce the spread of heroin use among youth and newly addicted individuals. The Division of Epidemiology and Prevention Research continues to sponsor both MTF and CEWG and funds promising treatment research in prevention. NIDA’s basic research division explores those behavioral and biomedical mechanisms associated with drug abuse and addiction. NIDA officials have indicated, however, that quickly focusing research on newly emerging drug problems is difficult, in part, because of the time it takes to generate grant applications and award grants in a new priority area. The extramural research grant application approval process has multiple stages and can take several months to complete. In some cases, NIDA can reduce the time consumed with the grant award process by administratively awarding supplements to existing grants. These supplements must not exceed 25 percent or $100,000 of a grantee’s base award, unless an exception is approved by the National Advisory Council on Drug Abuse. This approach was recently used to encourage research related to the rise in marijuana use among adolescents. In addition, NIH has made available a l-percent set-aside for special research initiatives. Using this set-aside, NIDA applied for and obtained an extra $2 million in funding to support additional methamphetamine activities directed at averting a crisis. NIDA also supports research training activities to help build a resource knowledge base for research on illicit drug use. Between 1986 and 1997, NIDA’s research training budget grew sharply, from a total of $1.43 million in 1986 to $11.7 million in 1997. However, NIDA’s research training budget, as a percentage of total extramural research funds, has consistently been lower than those of both NIMH and NIH throughout the 12-year period. In 1997, NIDA dedicated 2.6 percent of its extramural research budget to research training, as compared with NIMH’s 6.1 percent and NIH’s 4.1 percent. NIDA also conducts a number of public education activities to inform the general public, providers, and researchers about ongoing efforts to prevent and treat drug abuse. Moreover, NIDA provides research updates through various publications—such as the research monograph series, “NIDA Notes,” and information booklets on the various drugs. Recently, NIDA distributed more than 150,000 copies of a research-based guide on preventing drug use among children and adolescents to help control the rise in drug use among youth. NIDA has also presented its findings at national drug conferences, CEWG meetings, congressional hearings, and town meetings, as well as on the Internet. The agency recently released Assessing Drug Abuse Within and Across Communities, a science-based guide to helping communities detect, quantify, and categorize local drug abuse problems. In addition, as part of NIDA’s Treatment Initiative program, the agency intends to hold workshops with researchers, the treatment community, and the general public to exchange information about the treatment of drug abuse. The agency also plans to distribute research-based treatment manuals to community-based treatment providers. NIDA has the opportunity to evaluate the effectiveness of its activities under the Results Act. Because many of NIDA’s efforts to address changes in drug use patterns are research-oriented, however, the results of the agency’s performance could take a long time to materialize. Similarly, the impact that NIDA’s research efforts would have on an immediate response to newly emerging drug problems is questionable. On the basis of our work on implementing the Results Act in science agencies, we concluded that measuring the performance of science-related projects can be difficult because many factors determine whether research will result in benefits.Nevertheless, the Results Act provides a vehicle for NIDA to measure its performance and improve its effectiveness. Despite changes to federal drug detection mechanisms and congressional efforts to better position federal public health agencies to respond to emerging drug crises, concerns remain. While federal entities now have an array of tools to detect drug use, there is concern about the overall efficiency and effectiveness of these efforts. In addition, questions remain about when and how to best respond to emerging drug use trends. This is also an issue for state and local substance abuse authorities, who are challenged with allocating resources to address both current and emerging drug use problems. Given competing demands on federal, state, and local resources, it is important that the most appropriate drug prevention and treatment strategies are developed and effectively implemented. While a number of drug use detection mechanisms are now available, the ONDCP-established Subcommittee on Data, Evaluation, and Interagency Coordination of the Committee on Drug Control Research, Data, and Evaluation; our expert panel; and others have raised questions about the need for and quality of some of the data that are collected. Under the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994, ONDCP is required to assess the quality of mechanisms used to measure supply and demand reduction activities and to determine the adequacy of existing mechanisms to measure national drug use by the casual drug user population and populations at risk for drug use. The act also requires ONDCP to describe the actions it will take to correct any deficiencies and limitations identified. In 1995, ONDCP tasked the Subcommittee, composed of representatives from 19 federal agencies, with evaluating the adequacy and ability of federal drug-related data systems to inform the drug control policy planning process. In its July 1997 draft report, the Subcommittee concluded that a systematic approach for gathering drug-related data must be developed to ensure that policymakers and analysts have useful information for making public policy decisions. The Subcommittee recommended that duplication of effort in drug-related systems be identified and eliminated and that better use be made of regional-, state-, and local-level data. The Subcommittee saw a need for more accurate and complete information on chronic, hardcore drug users and for increased or enhanced information on illicit drug consumption and the risks and consequences of drug use, including expansion of such indicators beyond those obtained from hospital emergency departments, arrestees, and domestic violence records. The Subcommittee also recommended that data be made more available to researchers to encourage more in-depth analyses of existing data sets and broaden the dissemination of results. Our expert panel raised some of the same issues about the nation’s drug detection system that led to the Subcommittee’s recommendations. Moreover, officials in the several states and cities we visited raised similar—and additional—issues about the use of drug detection data, including the limited usefulness of federally generated drug detection information in monitoring most local changes in drug use patterns and the poor use of drug detection information generated by state and local substance abuse authorities. In commenting on this report, ONDCP officials stated that they have already begun implementing some of the “principles” in the Subcommittee’s draft report. Other assessments of the nation’s drug data collection efforts conducted in the early 1990s similarly concluded that drug-related data systems could be improved. For example, a RAND study found that policymakers have been handicapped by inconsistent and fragmented information. A University of California at Los Angeles Drug Abuse Research Center report concluded that the data systems were limited by inadequate coverage of people at high risk of drug use. In a 1993 report, we also raised concerns about gaps in coverage and methodological limitations of three major federal drug data collection mechanisms. Each of these three studies also questioned the validity of self-reported drug use information.Moreover, NIDA recently released a monograph that raises questions about the accuracy of some self-reported data on drug use. The usefulness of better and more timely information on emerging drug use problems is, in part, a function of the nation’s ability to respond to those problems, which itself is affected by demands on federal, state, and local resources to address ongoing substance abuse concerns. Still, a more defined strategy for responding is needed. While we learned of different approaches the federal government uses to respond to changing drug use patterns, some of which address emerging drugs, we found that no overall defined strategy for specifically addressing emerging drug use problems exists. Also, there is no agreed-upon set of operational definitions for key terms, such as “drug epidemic” or “drug crisis.” The experts we spoke with agree that determining an appropriate response to emerging drug use problems involves considering the timing of a response to a detected change in drug use patterns; the nature of the response—that is, the most effective prevention and treatment approaches to address a drug use problem at different stages; and the magnitude of the response, taking into account resource limitations and uncertainties about the potential scale of the problem. Determining the timing of a response is complicated by uncertainty about what point above the normative pattern of use warrants a response, either in a specific geographic area or nationwide. According to our expert panel, several factors—including availability of information, public opinion, and political sensitivity—play a role in determining the timing of a response to a detected change in drug use patterns. In addition, the most accurate and useful data are not always available for immediate decisions on when to respond to a particular change. Determining the nature of the response requires a better understanding of the extent to which various prevention and treatment approaches are effective in controlling specific drug use problems. A rise in marijuana use among youth and a shift in heroin use from injecting to smoking may require different approaches because of the drug, the population, or both. In a 1997 report, we highlighted the varying prevention approaches and limitations in our knowledge about the effectiveness of these strategies.Similarly, as we reported earlier this year, knowledge about the types of treatment interventions that are most effective for specific drugs and populations varies. Even with limited knowledge, decisions about the nature of a response must be made. Determining the magnitude of a response is complicated by the risk of misallocating scarce federal, state, and local resources to combat a problem that may not warrant the investment. There is also the risk of inadvertently promoting the use of a drug to risk-takers by creating too much publicity addressing its dangers. Consideration must also be given to the capacity of the system to treat those who currently seek or will seek treatment. Our expert panel told us that states and local communities barely have sufficient resources to meet the present demand for drug treatment and thus might devote less focused attention to addressing emerging drug use problems or potential future epidemics. Moreover, we heard from SAMHSA and officials in some of the cities we visited that there is a large demand for substance abuse treatment. In two of the three cities we visited, officials are trying to implement a treatment-on-demand program to provide services for drug users when they need them most and are most receptive to treatment; however, there is uncertainty about how many drug users will seek help and the cost of providing them treatment. Some researchers believe that to improve the chances of deterring the spread of emerging drug problems or epidemics, greater attention must be given to changes in drug use patterns at the local level, where such problems typically originate. Although SAMHSA has relationships with states through the block grant program, experts in the drug field describe less than adequate linkages between state and local communities and the three major federal agencies involved in drug abuse demand reduction efforts. ONDCP, SAMHSA, and NIDA do not currently have a well-established network with the many local entities associated with reducing drug use, and their relationships with states and local communities might not facilitate a response to an emerging drug problem at the local level. A defined strategy for addressing emerging drug problems would benefit from better linkages with state and local entities to capitalize on their experiences with local drug crises or epidemics. Although addressing drug use problems is not necessarily the same as addressing infectious diseases, the networks and linkages with state and local entities that have been established by CDC may be worth considering for detecting and responding to emerging drug use problems. CDC is responsible for detecting and responding to potential health crises, such as outbreaks of infectious and chronic diseases. The agency has established relationships with states and local entities through a number of efforts, some of which follow: CDC’s Epidemic Intelligence Service enables the agency to maximize its investigative capabilities. According to CDC officials, each year the Service trains approximately 75 epidemiological investigators and requires that they engage in at least one investigation at the state level and at headquarters during a 2-year follow-up period. At any given time, CDC has up to 150 epidemiologists to call on to assess a potential public health epidemic or crisis. Through direct on-site public health surveillance, CDC can gain rapid and in-depth understanding of the initiation and spread of a public health problem. These investigations enable CDC to target specific individuals and groups affected and likely to be affected, identify the circumstances under which infections take place and spread, track the movement of the problem across geographic areas, and establish the time parameters governing the infection of each subsequent target group. Through collaboration with the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists, CDC is able to ensure broad geographic coverage, since the group includes representatives from all 50 states and the U.S. territories. CDC has established procedures with states for quick responses to perceived health crises. If a state public health agency is experiencing a problem in either identifying or managing a public health problem, CDC can be called on to provide immediate guidance and support. According to a CDC official, if the problem is not one that can be handled over the telephone, CDC is able to quickly dispatch appropriate staff to the scene to provide on-site public health surveillance and response support. The public health agencies’ approach to addressing drug use problems in the United States has changed since the mid-1980s. Given changes made in the drug use detection mechanisms, organizational changes in HHS’ drug control agencies, and the creation of ONDCP, the federal capability to address emerging drug use problems has been enhanced. However, the benefits of these changes depend largely on how drug data are used and how well the agencies carry out their roles and responsibilities. For example, the complement of drug use detection mechanisms available to public health agencies and others now provides more timely data and broader geographic and population coverage. However, ONDCP’s Subcommittee on Data, Evaluation, and Interagency Coordination; our expert panel; and others have pointed out weaknesses that need to be addressed to improve the accuracy of drug data and to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of the nation’s drug data collection systems. ONDCP, NIDA, and SAMHSA officials report that some of their efforts are addressing emerging drug problems. However, these agencies have no overall defined strategy that addresses factors such as how to determine the timing, nature, and magnitude of a response to new patterns of drug use identified through the nation’s surveillance systems. In addition, maintaining ongoing mechanisms with the capacity to link surveillance knowledge from local and national sources with knowledge about effective demand reduction approaches should increase our nation’s capability to deter future drug crises. We recognize that developing a defined strategy for addressing emerging drug problems will be challenging because of data uncertainties and other factors, such as engaging federal, state, and local entities in collaborative response actions. However, the CDC approach to responding to emerging infectious diseases might offer some insights on establishing linkages with state and local entities and developing response protocols. Since ONDCP is responsible for developing and coordinating a national drug control strategy, it could take the lead in improving the nation’s drug data collection system and coordinating the development of a strategy to address future emerging drug use problems. To improve the nation’s drug use detection and response capability, we recommend that the Director of ONDCP implement any additional changes that would improve the completeness, accuracy, and overall usefulness of data generated by the nation’s drug data collection mechanisms; take action to further improve the federal drug data collection system by determining what data should be collected and developing a systematic approach for gathering, analyzing, and disseminating information; and develop a defined strategy for determining the timing, magnitude, and nature of actions needed to appropriately respond to potential drug crises or epidemics, taking into consideration that emerging drug problems surface as local phenomena. We obtained comments on a draft of this report from ONDCP, SAMHSA, NIDA, and CDC, as well as from most of our expert panel members. With the exceptions noted below, the reviewers generally agreed with the findings, conclusions, and recommendations in the report. Some of them provided additional information and clarification and suggested technical changes, which we incorporated where appropriate. While concurring with the report’s recommendations, ONDCP expressed concern about the way the report framed some issues. Specifically, the agency was concerned that the report and two of its recommendations suggested that no action had been taken on the ONDCP Subcommittee’s recommendations to improve the nation’s drug data collection system. ONDCP commented that it has begun taking some actions to change and evaluate certain drug use detection and monitoring mechanisms even though its Subcommittee’s report is still in draft form. We were unaware of specific actions taken on the Subcommittee’s recommendations at the time of our review, and we commend these initial steps. We continue to believe, however, that ONDCP should take additional actions as recommended to address the concerns raised about the accuracy and usefulness of the data and the overall effectiveness of the federal drug data collection system. ONDCP agreed with our recommendation that calls for a defined strategy for addressing emerging drug problems and said that its Performance Measures of Effectiveness system will possibly provide a framework for developing such a strategy. SAMHSA agreed with many of the findings in the report but raised a concern that our recommendation to improve the completeness and accuracy of drug data did not address the importance of maximizing the usefulness of the data. We agree that the overall usefulness of the data is important, and we modified our recommendation accordingly. SAMHSA also wanted to elaborate on its statement to us that the agency was not adequately positioned to deter emerging drug use that might result in future epidemics. We added the information the agency provided in the text of the report. SAMHSA disagreed with our statement that it had not provided sufficient information in HHS’ Results Act annual performance plan about how SAMHSA would meet its performance goals. However, the agency did not provide any information to support its contention. NIDA expressed some concern about issues that were not addressed in this report. For example, NIDA stated that the report did not sufficiently speculate on how the different entities involved in drug control enhance or impede addressing emergent issues or how law enforcement and interdiction agencies affect federal efforts to detect and respond to emerging drug use problems. The agency also stated that the report does not specify what the appropriate role of each level of government should be. Although these issues were beyond the scope of our review, we acknowledge that there are multiple entities involved in detecting and responding to emerging drug problems and that how their roles, responsibilities, and efforts play out in an overall strategy for addressing the problems is unclear. We recommended that ONDCP take the lead in developing a defined strategy for addressing emerging drug problems. This would give the entities involved in drug control activities an opportunity to determine the appropriate roles each should play. Both NIDA and SAMHSA reacted to our suggestion that CDC’s approach to addressing public health issues, which involves state and local entities, might be a useful approach to consider in developing a strategy for addressing emerging drug problems. NIDA thought that the suggestion was reasonable but that developing networks and linkages to deal with drug problems would not be quickly or easily accomplished. SAMHSA felt that the CDC approach would be very expensive to replicate and that there are factors associated with drug abuse that do not fit the CDC model. SAMHSA concluded that adopting the CDC approach would be an unwise expenditure of funds, although it did not provide any cost analysis or other data to support its statements. While we agree that the cost and other implications, such as differences between drug abuse and other disease models, should be taken into account, we continue to believe that the CDC approach serves as a useful example of how linkages among federal, state, and local entities can facilitate the detection of and response to a problem.

An essential component of our research effort was an expert panel that provided advice and offered opinions on the nation’s preparedness to address changing drug use patterns. The following experts composed the panel: M. Douglas Anglin, Ph.D., Director UCLA Drug Abuse Research Center John S. Gustafson, Executive Director National Association of State Alcohol and Drug Abuse Directors James Hall, Executive Director Up Front Drug Information Center Bruce Johnson, Ph.D., Director Institute for Special Populations Research National Development and Research Institutes Henrick Harwood The Lewin Group Herbert Kleber, M.D. Executive Vice President and Medical Director Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse, Columbia University, and Professor of Psychiatry, Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons A. Thomas McLellan, Ph.D., Scientific Director DeltaMetrics in Association With Treatment Research Institute University of Pennsylvania Before convening the panel, we sent each panelist a discussion paper containing a brief description of the current array of detection mechanisms used by the public health service agencies and the Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP); the legislative responsibilities of the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), and ONDCP to address illicit drug use problems; and information these agencies gave us about how they implement their responsibilities and respond to changes in drug use patterns. During the session, we asked the panelists to discuss the effectiveness of the current detection mechanisms—that is, whether new or modified mechanisms and data information sources are needed to detect changes in illicit drug use patterns more quickly and accurately. We also asked the panelists to discuss whether NIDA, SAMHSA, and ONDCP were individually, and in conjunction, responding appropriately to detected drug use patterns to prevent, deter, or better manage potential drug epidemics and crises. Next, we asked the panelists to comment on the extent to which past legislative changes had improved or hampered federal response capacity and whether additional legislative or mission statement changes were needed to guide the activities of these agencies. Finally, we asked the panelists to review a synthesis of the comments made during the session and to offer any additional suggestions and recommendations to improve the nation’s drug detection and response system.

GAO noted that: (1) despite certain limitations in its sources of information, the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) was able to track the use of a number of illicit drugs, including cocaine, during the late 1970s and early 1980s; (2) two drug detection mechanisms NIDA used as a part of that effort helped detect the emergence of crack--a smokable form of cocaine; (3) NIDA had become aware of the rapid spread of crack in 17 metropolitan areas by 1986, but the prevalence of crack use in the national household population was not known until the late 1980s; (4) federal public health agencies primarily directed their response efforts to the problem of cocaine and drug abuse in general, rather than to crack specifically; (5) the response, orchestrated largely by NIDA, focused primarily on drug abuse research and education; (6) the Alcohol, Drug Abuse, and Mental Health Administration provided funding to state and local entities for substance abuse prevention and treatment services through the federal block grant program during the 1980s; (7) following the height of the crack epidemic around 1985, concerns were raised in Congress about efforts to detect and respond to the problem--in particular about the timeliness and accuracy of drug use data, lack of data on certain populations and geographic areas, limited availability of certain treatment programs, limited monitoring of the block grant program, and lack of a coordinated national drug control strategy; (8) in response, the responsible federal agencies made changes to improve drug detection capability--changes that included adding new detection mechanisms; (9) also, to help strengthen the federal response to drug problems, Congress legislated changes in the organization of the Department of Health and Human Services' major drug control agencies: the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration was created as a separate agency to focus on prevention and treatment services, and, to emphasize its research focus, NIDA was moved to the National Institutes of Health; (10) in addition, Congress created the Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) to develop a national drug control strategy and coordinate the national drug control effort; (11) despite these changes, concerns remain about the nation's ability to detect and respond to emerging drug problems; (12) ONDCP established a group to study the use of drug data that has recommended ways to improve the nation's drug data collection system; and (13) in addition, experts agree on the need for an overall strategy among key drug control agencies for managing emerging drug problems.",govreport
"DOD relies on its research laboratories and test facilities as well as industry and academia to develop new technologies and systems that improve and enhance military operations and ensure technological superiority over adversaries. Yet, historically, DOD has experienced problems in bringing technologies out of the lab environment and into real use. At times, technologies do not leave the lab because their potential has not been adequately demonstrated or recognized. In other cases, acquisition programs—which receive the bulk of DOD’s funding in research, development, testing and evaluation of technology—are simply unwilling to fund final stages of development of a promising technology, preferring to invest in other aspects of the program that are viewed as more vital to success. Other times, they choose to develop the technologies themselves, rather than rely on DOD labs to do so—a practice that brings cost and schedule risk since programs may well find themselves addressing problems related to technology immaturity that hamper other aspects of the acquisition process. And often, DOD’s budgeting process, which requires investments to be targeted at least 2 years in advance of their activation, makes it difficult for DOD to seize opportunities to introduce technological advances into acquisition programs. In addition, it is challenging just to identify and pursue technologies that could be used to enhance military operations given the very wide range of organizations inside and outside of DOD that are focused on technology development and the wide range of capabilities that DOD is interested in advancing. In recognizing this array of challenges, DOD and Congress have established a number of “technology transition” programs, each with a particular focus. (See table 1.) The Advanced Concept Technology Demonstration (ACTD) program, for example, was initiated by DOD in 1994 as a way to get technologies that meet critical military needs into the hands of users faster and at less cost than the traditional acquisition process. Under this program, military operators test prototypes that have already been developed and matured in realistic settings. If they find the items to have military utility, DOD may choose to buy additional quantities or just use the items remaining after the demonstration. In 1980, DOD established the Foreign Comparative Testing (FCT) Program to identify, evaluate, and procure technologies that have already been developed and tested in other countries—saving DOD the costly burden of maturing the technology itself. Other programs include those that seek to quickly identify and solve production problems associated with technology transition (the Manufacturing Technology Program—MANTECH) and to partner with the commercial sector in completing projects that are useful to both military and industry (the Dual Use Science and Technology program). Even taken together, however, these programs represent a very small portion of DOD dollars spent on applied research and advanced technology development—about $9 billion annually—and considerably less of total money spent on the later stages of technology development, which includes an additional $60 billion spent on advanced component development and prototypes, largely within weapons acquisition programs. As such, they cannot single-handedly overcome transition problems, but rather demonstrate various ways to ease transition and broaden participation from the industrial base. Three of the more recent initiatives include the TTI and DACP, both established by Congress in fiscal year 2003, and the Quick Reaction Fund, established by DOD the same year. TTI is focused on speeding the transition of technologies developed by DOD’s S&T programs into acquisition programs, while DACP is focused on introducing innovative and cost-saving technologies developed inside and outside DOD. The Quick Reaction Fund is focused on field testing technology prototypes. All three programs are managed by DOD’s Office of Defense Research and Engineering, which reports to the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics. Together, these three programs received about $64 million in fiscal year 2005–a fraction of the $9.2 billion DOD invested in applied research and advanced technology development the same year and a relatively small budget compared to some of the other transition programs. Nevertheless, DOD has been increasing its investment in these programs and plans to further increase it over the next few years. (See figure 1.) Table 2 highlights similarities and differences between DACP, TTI, and Quick Reaction Fund. Table 3 provides examples of projects that have already been funded. The three transition programs, which are being implemented consistent with congressional intent, reported that benefits can already be seen in many projects, including improvements to performance, affordability, manufacturability, and operational capability for the warfighter. While such benefits may have eventually been achieved through normal processes, program officials believe the three transition programs enabled DOD to realize them sooner due to the immediate funding that was provided to complete testing and evaluation as well as attention received from senior managers. DOD officials also emphasized that these programs are calling attention to emerging technologies that have the potential to offer important performance gains and cost savings but, due to their size and relative obscurity, may otherwise be overlooked when competing against other, larger-scaled technologies and/or technologies already deemed as vital to a particular acquisition program’s success. Another benefit cited with the DACP is an expansion of the Defense industrial base, because the program invites participation from companies and individuals that have not been traditional business partners with DOD. Nevertheless, it is too early for us to determine the impact that these programs have had on technology transition. At the time we selected projects to review, few projects had been completed. In addition, the programs had limited performance measures to gauge success of individual projects or track return on investment over time. The following examples highlight some of the reported benefits of individual projects. Host Weapons Shock Profile Database—DOD spends a significant amount of time and resources to test new accessories (e.g., night vision scopes) for Special Operations Forces weapons. Currently, when new accessories are added, they must go through live fire testing to determine if they work properly and will meet reliability standards. This process could take several months to complete as the acquisition office must schedule time at a test range to complete the testing. Program officials must also identify and pay for an expert to conduct the testing and pay for ammunition that will be used in the test. The DACP is funding the test and evaluation of a database that will simulate the vibration or shock of various machine guns in order to test new accessories for that gun. This will eliminate almost all of the testing costs mentioned above and greatly reduce the amount of time needed for testing. The project office estimates that it will save almost $780,000 per year in ammunition costs alone. Enhanced Optics for the Rolling Airframe Missile—The Rolling Airframe Missile is part of the Navy’s ship self-defense system to counter attacks from missiles and aircraft. However, the missile experiences operational deficiencies in certain weather conditions, and the program has had problems producing components for the optics. The DACP is providing funding to a small business to test and evaluate a new sapphire dome and optics for the missile to resolve these problems. Program officials estimate that program funding will accelerate the development of a solution 1 to 2 years earlier than anticipated. If the DACP project is successful, an added benefit will be that the dome material will be readily available from manufacturers in the United States instead of a single overseas supplier, as is currently the case. Water Purification System— For tactical situations in which deployed troops do not have quick and easy access to potable water, the pen will allow soldiers to treat up to 300 liters of any available, non-brackish water source on one set of lithium camera batteries and common table salt. The pen eliminates the risk of the soldiers’ exposure to diseases and bio-chemical pollutants. TTI funding was used to purchase approximately 6,600 water pens for distribution to the military services. In addition, TTI funding enabled this item to be placed on a General Services Administration schedule, where approximately 8,600 additional water pens have been purchased by DOD customers. DOD and the company that produces the pen donated hundreds of these systems to the tsunami relief effort in Southeast Asia. Dragon Eye—The Dragon Eye is a small, unmanned aerial vehicle with video surveillance capabilities used by the marines. To address the concerns over a chemical and biological threat to troops in Iraq, the Quick Reaction Fund funded the integration of a small chemical detection and biological collection device on the Dragon Eye. The low- flying Dragon Eye can tell troops in real time where and when it is collecting samples, and in cases where a plume is detected, it can determine the direction the plume is moving. According to program officials, Quick Reaction funding allowed the chemical and biological detection capability to be developed 2 years ahead of schedule. The technology was available to a limited number of Special Operations Forces at the beginning of the Iraqi conflict. Despite the evident benefits of certain projects, it is too early to determine the programs’ impact on technology transition. At the time we selected projects for review, only 11 of 68 projects started in fiscal years 2003 and 2004 had been completed, and, of those, only 4 were currently available to warfighters. These include one TTI project—a miniaturized water purification system that is now being offered through a General Services Administration schedule to the warfighter—and three projects under the Quick Reaction Fund, including the Dragon Eye chemical and biological sensor, planning software used by Combatant Commanders dealing with weapons of mass destruction targets, and special materials that strengthen unmanned aerial vehicles. Since the time we selected projects, 20 have been reported as completed and 13 have been reported as available to warfighters. The latest project completion information by program is shown in Table 4. It is important to note that, even though 20 TTI and Quick Reaction Fund projects are considered to be complete, not all of the capabilities have reached the warfighter. For example: The T58 Titanium Nitride Erosion Protection is a TTI project that has transitioned to an acquisition program but has not yet reached the warfighter. The project is being developed to improve the reliability of T-58-16A helicopter engines used in Iraq. While the compressor blades are designed for 3000 operating hours, the Marine Corps has had to remove engines with fewer than 150 operational hours due to sand ingestion. The project received funding from the TTI in fiscal years 2003 and 2004 to develop a titanium nitride coating for engine blades that would significantly mitigate erosion problems in a desert environment. According to program documents, blades with the new coating will be included in future production lots beginning in July 2005. Modification kits will also be developed for retrofitting engines already produced. Program officials expect the project will double the compressor life of the engine in a sand environment and save about $12 million in life-cycle costs through fiscal year 2012. The Ping project, funded by the Quick Reaction Fund, is an example of a project that is considered complete, but a prototype was never field tested by the warfighter. The Air Force had hoped to broaden the capability of the microwave technology it used to identify large objects such as tanks or cars to also detect concealed weapons or explosives— such as suicide vests. However, the project was cancelled after some initial testing revealed that the technology was not accurate enough to determine the microwave signatures of small arms or suicide vests that could have numerous configurations and materials. DOD officials stated that, even though the project was unsuccessful, they gained a better understanding of microwave technologies and are continuing to develop these technologies for other applications. The long-term impact of the programs will also be difficult to determine because the technology transition programs have a limited set of metrics to gauge project success or the impact of program funding over time. While each funded project had to identify potential impact in terms of dollar savings, performance improvements, or acceleration to the field as part of the proposal process, actual impact of specific projects as well as the transition programs as a whole is not being tracked consistently. The value of having performance measures as well as DOD’s progress in adopting them for these transition programs is discussed in the next section of this report. To ensure that new technologies can be effectively transitioned and integrated into acquisitions, transition programs need to establish effective selection, management and oversight, and assessment processes. For example, programs must assure that proposals being accepted have established a sound business case, that is, technologies being transitioned are fairly mature and in demand and schedules and cost for transition fit within the program’s criteria. Once projects are selected, there needs to be continual and effective communication between labs and acquisition programs so that commitment can be sustained even when problems arise. To assure that the return on investment is being maximized, the impact of programs must be tracked, including cost and time savings as well as performance enhancements. Our work over the past 7 years has found that high-performing organizations adopt these basic practices as a means for successfully transitioning technologies into acquisitions. Moreover, several larger DOD technology transition programs, such as the ACTD program and some Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) projects, embrace similar practices and have already developed tools to help sustain commitment, such as memorandums of agreement between technology developers and acquirers. Both DARPA and ACTD manage budgets that are considerably larger than the programs included in this review. As such, the level of detail and rigor associated with their management processes may not be appropriate for TTI, DACP, or Quick Reaction Fund. However, the concepts and basic ingredients of their criteria and guidance could serve as a useful starting point for the smaller programs to strengthen their own processes. The three programs we reviewed adopted these practices to varying degrees. Overall, the DACP had disciplined and well-defined processes for selecting and managing, and overseeing projects. The TTI had disciplined and well-defined processes for selecting projects, but less formal processes for management and oversight. The Quick Reaction Fund was the least formal and disciplined of all three, believing that success was being achieved through flexibility and a high degree of senior management attention. All three programs had limited performance measures to gauge progress and return on investment. Generally, we found that the more the programs adopted structured and disciplined management processes, the fewer problems they encountered with individual efforts. Success in transitioning technologies from a lab to the field or an acquisition program hinges on a transition program’s ability to choose the most promising technology projects. This includes technologies that can substantially enhance an existing or new system either through better performance or cost savings and those with technologies at a fairly mature stage, in other words, suitable for final stages of testing and evaluation. A program can only do this, however, if it is able to clearly communicate its purpose and reach the right audience to submit proposals in the first place. It is also essential that a program have a systematic process for determining the relative technical maturity of the project as well as for evaluating other aspects of the project, such as its potential to benefit specific acquisition programs. Involving individuals in the selection process from various functions within an organization—e.g., technical, business, and acquisition—further helps to assure that the right projects are being chosen and that they will have interested customers. An analytical tool that can be particularly useful in selecting projects is a technology readiness level (TRL) assessment, which assesses the maturity level of a technology ranging from paper studies (level 1), to prototypes that can be tested in a realistic environment (level 7), to an actual system that has proven itself in mission operations (level 9). Our prior work has found TRLs to be a valuable decision-making tool because it can presage the likely consequences of incorporating a technology at a given level of maturity into a product development. As further detailed in table 5, the DACP program has a fairly robust selection process. The program relies on internet-based tools to communicate its goals and announce its selection process and ensure a broad audience is targeted. As a result, it receives a wide array of proposals from which the program office assesses their potential for generating improvements to existing programs as well as actual interest from the acquisition community. The DACP also solicits technical experts from inside and outside DOD to assess potential benefits and risks. Once the number of projects is whittled down, the program takes extra steps to secure commitments from acquisition program managers as well as program executive officers. The program’s popularity, however, has had some drawbacks. For example, the sheer number of proposals have tended to overwhelm DACP staff and slowed down the selection process, particularly in the first year. In addition, while technology benefits and risks are assessed in making selection decisions, DACP does not formally confirm the technology readiness levels being reported. The TTI program also has a fairly rigorous selection process, with specific criteria for selection, including technology readiness, and a team of representatives of higher-level DOD S&T officials in charge of disseminating information about the program in their organization, assessing their organization’s proposals based on TTI criteria as well as other criteria they developed, and ranking their top proposals. The program, which is focused on reaching DOD’s S&T community rather than outside industry, had been communicating in a relatively informal manner and it was unclear during our review the extent to which the TTI was reaching its intended audience. The program, however, has been taking steps to strengthen its ability to reach out to the S&T community. In addition, TTI does not confirm TRLs. At the time of our review, the Quick Reaction Program selection process was much less structured and disciplined than DACP and TTI. This was by design, because the program wants to select projects quickly and get them out to the field where they can be of use in military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, and elsewhere. However, the program experienced problems related to selection and as a result—for example, significant gaps in knowledge about technology readiness led to the cancellation of one project. To program officials, the risk associated with less formal selection is worth the benefit of being able to move rapidly evolving technologies into an environment where they can begin to immediately enhance military operations and potentially save lives. Nevertheless, the program is now taking steps to strengthen selection processes. Selecting promising projects for funding is not enough to ensure successful transition. Program managers must also actively oversee implementation to make sure that project goals are being met and the program is working as intended and to identify potential barriers to transition. They must also sustain commitment from acquirers. Moreover, the transition program as a whole must have good visibility over progress and be positioned to shift attention and resources to problems as they arise. A tool that has proven particularly useful for other established DOD technology transition programs is designating individuals, preferably with experience in acquisitions or operations and/or the S&T world, as “deal brokers” or agents to facilitate communication between the lab and the acquisition program and to resolve problems as they arise. DARPA employs such individuals, for example, as well as some Navy-specific transition programs. Both have found that these agents have been integral to transition success. Another tool that is useful for sustaining commitment from the acquirers is a formal agreement. Our previous work found that best practice companies develop agreements with cost and schedule targets to achieve and sustain buy-in and that the agreements are modified as a project progresses to reflect more specific terms for accepting or rejecting a technology. DARPA develops similar agreements that describe how projects will be executed and funded as well as how projects will be terminated if the need arises. The agreements are signed by high-level officials, including the director of DARPA and senior-level representatives of the organizations DARPA is working with. The ACTD program develops “implementation directives” that clarify roles and responsibilities of parties executing an ACTD, time frames, funding, and the operational parameters by which military effectiveness is to be evaluated. The agreements are also signed by high-level officials. DACP has fairly robust management and oversight mechanisms. Status is monitored via formal quarterly reporting as well as interim meetings which, at a minimum, involve the customer, the developer, and the DACP project manager. The meetings provide an opportunity to ensure the acquisition program is still committed to the project and to resolve problems. Though formal memoranda of agreements are not usually employed, the program establishes test and evaluation plans that detail pass/fail criteria so that funding does not continue on projects that experience insurmountable problems. TTI also employs periodic status reports and meetings; however, communication has not been as open. In two cases, projects ran into significant problems, such as loss of acquisition program office support in one case and logistics issues that had not been addressed to transition a technology smoothly in the other, which had not come to the attention of the TTI program office. As a result, the TTI office thought the projects had transitioned when in actuality, significant problems still needed to be addressed. Per legislation, TTI had also established a formal council comprised of high-level DOD officials to help oversee the program; however, the Council has only met once in 2 years, while the act requires that it meet at least semiannually. In addition, there is some confusion among Council members and others we spoke with as to what the purpose of the Council should be—that is, focused on TTI only or broader transition issues. Congressional officials expressed that they intended for the Council to focus on broader transition issues and how best to solve them. Although the Quick Reaction Fund does not require status reports to assess progress, project managers are required to submit after-action reports. However, these were not regularly reviewed by the office. We identified several problems that arose during transition that were not known to the Quick Reaction Fund program manager. The program manager is currently taking steps to improve the management and oversight of projects. For example, a website has been developed to help monitor and execute the program. Among other things, the website will allow for the automatic collection of monthly status reports. Though the transition programs we reviewed are relatively small in scale compared to other transition programs in DOD, the government’s investment is still considerable and it will continue to grow if DOD’s funding plans for the programs are approved. As a result, it is important that these programs demonstrate that they are generating a worthwhile return on investment—whether through cost savings to acquisition programs, reduced times for completing testing and evaluation and integrating technologies into programs, and/or enhanced performance or new capabilities. Developing such information can enable transition program managers to identify what is or is not working well within a program; how well the program is measuring up to its goals, as well as to make trade-off decisions between individual projects. On a broader level, it can enable senior managers and oversight officials to compare and contrast the performance of transition programs across DOD. Finding the right measures to use for this purpose is challenging, however, given the wide range of projects being pursued, the different environments to which they are being applied, and difficulties associated with measuring certain aspects of return on investment. For example, measuring long-term cost savings could be problematical because some projects could have impacts on platforms and systems that were not part of the immediate transition effort. As a result, the best place to start may be with high-level or broad metrics or narratives that focus on the spectrum of benefits and cost savings being achieved through the program, complemented by more specific quantifiable metrics that do not require enormous efforts to develop and support, such as time saved in transition or short-term cost savings. At this time, however, the transition programs have limited measures to gauge individual project success and program impact or return on investment in the long term. At best, they are collecting after action reports that describe the results of transition projects, and occasionally identify some cost savings, but not in a consistent manner. In addition, there are inconsistencies in how the reports are being prepared, reviewed, and used. The Quick Reaction Fund program manager, in fact, had trouble just getting projects to submit after action reports. Officials from all three transition programs we reviewed as well as higher level officials agreed that they should be doing more to capture information regarding return on investments for the programs. They also agreed that there may already be readily available starting points within DOD. For example, the Foreign Comparative Testing Program has established metrics to measure the health, success, and cost-effectiveness of the program and has developed a database to facilitate return on investment analyses. The program also captures general performance enhancements in written narratives. The program has refined and improved its metrics over time and used them to develop annual reports. The specific metrics established by the FCT program may not be readily transferable to DACP, TTI, or the Quick Reaction Fund because the nature of FCT projects is quite different—technologies themselves are more mature and costs savings are achieved by virtue of the fact that DOD is essentially avoiding the cost of developing the technologies rather than applying the technologies to improve larger development efforts. However, the process by which the program came to identify useful metrics as well as the automated tools it uses could be valuable to the other transition programs. In addition, DOD has asked the Naval Post Graduate School to study metrics that would be useful for assessing the ACTD program. The results of this study may also serve as a starting point for the transition programs in developing their own ways to assess return on investment. The ability to spur and leverage technological advances is vital to sustaining DOD’s ability to maintain its superiority over others and to improve and even transform how military operations are conducted. The three new transition programs are all appropriately targeted on what has been a critical problem in this regard—quickly moving promising technologies from the laboratory and commercial environment into actual use. Moreover, by tailoring processes and criteria to focus on different objectives, whether that may be saving time or money or broadening the industrial base, DOD has had an opportunity to experiment with a variety of management approaches and criteria that can be used to help solve transition problems affecting the approximately $69 billion spent annually on advanced stages of technology development. Already, it is evident that an element missing from all three programs is good performance measurement. Without having this capability, DOD will not be able to effectively assess which approaches are working best and whether the programs individually or as a whole are truly worthwhile. In addition, it is evident that having well-established tools for selecting and managing projects as well as communicating with technology developers and acquisitions helps programs to reduce risk and achieve success, and that there are opportunities for all three programs for strengthening their capabilities in this regard. In light of its plans to increase funding for the three programs, DOD should consider actions to strengthen selection and management capabilities, while taking into account resources needed for implementing them as well as their impact on the ability of the programs to maintain flexibility. We recommend that the Secretary of Defense take the following five actions: To optimize DOD’s growing investment in the Technology Transition Initiative, the Defense Acquisition Challenge Program, and the Quick Reaction Fund, we recommend that the Secretary of Defense direct the Under Secretary of Defense (Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics) to develop data and measures that can be used to support assessments of the performance of the three transition programs as well as broader assessments of the return on investment that would track the long-term impact of the programs. DOD could use measures already developed by other transition programs, such as FCT, as a starting point as well as the results of its study on performance measurement being conducted by the Naval Post Graduate School. To complement this effort, we recommend that DOD develop formal feedback mechanisms, consisting of interim and after action reporting, as well as project reviews if major deviations occur in a project. Deviations include, but are not limited to, changes in the technology developer, acquirer, or user, or an inability for the technology developer to meet cost, schedule, or performance parameters at key points in time. We also recommend that the Secretary of Defense direct the Under Secretary of Defense (Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics) to implement the following, as appropriate, for each of the transition programs: (1) formal agreements to solidify up-front technology development agreements related to cost, schedule, and performance parameters that must be met at key points in time and (2) confirmation of technology readiness levels as part of the proposal acceptance process. In addition, we recommend that DOD identify and implement mechanisms to ensure that transition program managers, developers, and acquirers are able to better communicate to collectively identify and resolve problems that could hinder technology transition. There may be opportunities to strengthen communication by improving the structure and content of interim progress meetings and possibly even designating individuals to act as deal brokers. Lastly, as DOD considers solutions to broader technology transition problems, we recommend that Secretary of Defense direct the Under Secretary of Defense (Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics) to assess how the Technology Transition Council can be better used. DOD provided us with written comments on a draft of this report. DOD partially concurred with four of the five recommendations and concurred with one recommendation. The reason DOD only partially concurred with four of the recommendations is because it does not believe the Quick Reaction Fund fits the definition of a transition program. However, we continue to believe it is important for DOD to institute better management controls and have better visibility of the Quick Reaction Fund as it increases its investment in this program over the next several years. DOD comments appear in appendix I. DOD partially concurred with our recommendation that the programs develop data and measures that can be used to support assessments of the performance of the three transition programs as well as broader assessments of return on investment that would track the long term impact of the programs. DOD agreed that performance measures for the DACP and TTI programs could be improved but does not believe that measuring the impact of the Quick Reaction Fund is necessary because it does not technically fit the definition of a transition program. We disagree. DOD should track the progress of its various programs to determine if the programs are worthwhile and should be continued, if the program should receive additional funding, or if changes should be made in the selection or implementation process that could result in better outcomes. Further, failure to track even the most basic information, such as the number of projects completed, could result in a lack of ability to manage the program properly and poor stewardship of taxpayer money. DOD partially concurred with our recommendation that the three programs develop formal feedback mechanisms consisting of interim and after action reporting, as well as project reviews if major deviations occur in a project. DOD agrees that the TTI and DACP can be improved and has recently taken steps in this regard. However, DOD believes that due to the limited scope and duration of Quick Reaction Fund projects, formal feedback mechanisms may not be necessary for this program. We believe that regular feedback on the progress of each program is important to help program managers mitigate risk. As stated in the report, the Quick Reaction Fund program manager was unaware that one project ran out of funding prior to field testing the technology. Had the program manager been aware of the problem, money that had not yet been allocated could have been used to finish the project. In addition, based upon our discussions with the current program manager, DOD is planning to require monthly status reports for funded projects. DOD partially concurred with our recommendation that the programs implement, as appropriate: (1) formal agreements to solidify up-front technology development agreements related to cost, schedule, and performance parameters that must be met at key points in time and (2) confirmation of technology readiness levels as part of the proposal acceptance process. DOD indicated that it recently implemented Technology Transition Agreements for the TTI, and the DACP program also uses formal agreements. However, DOD does not believe formal agreements are necessary for the Quick Reaction Fund because it is not intended to be a transition program. Also, it does not believe TRLs should be a factor in the proposal acceptance process. As stated in the report, we agree that formal agreements may not be appropriate for Quick Reaction Fund projects. However, TRLs should be considered during the selection process. Since the goal of this particular program is to prototype a new technology in 12 months or less, it is important that DOD has some assurance that the technology is ready to be field tested. As discussed in the report, the Quick Reaction Fund had to cancel one project, after $1.5 million had already been spent, because it had only achieved a TRL 3. Had the selecting official known the TRLs of each proposed project during the selection phase, he may have decided to fund another, more mature project instead. DOD also partially concurred with our recommendation that the programs identify and implement mechanisms to ensure that transition program managers, developers, and acquirers better communicate and collectively identify and resolve problems that could hinder technology transition. DOD established a Transition Overarching Integrated Product Team earlier this year to provide the necessary oversight structure to address this issue, but does not believe this recommendation applies to the Quick Reaction Fund program. We believe that if DOD receives monthly status reports on the Quick Reaction Fund, as planned by the program manager, it should be in a good position to identify and resolve problems that could hinder the testing of new technology prototypes. DOD concurred with our recommendation that the Under Secretary of Defense (Acquisition, Technology and Logistics) assess how the Technology Transition Council can be better used as DOD considers solutions to broader technology transition problems. Although DOD did not indicate how it plans to do this, the Deputy Under Secretary of Defense (Advanced Systems and Concepts) has a goal that the Council not limit itself to just the TTI program, but look at broader technology transition issues across DOD. We are sending copies of this report to the Secretary of Defense, the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, and interested congressional committees. We will also make copies available at no charge on the GAO Web site at http://www.gao.gov. If you or your staff have any questions concerning this report, please contact me at (937) 258-7915. Key contributors to this report were Cristina Chaplain, Cheryl Andrew, Art Cobb, Gary Middleton, and Sean D. Merrill.","The Department of Defense (DOD) and Congress both recognize that Defense technology innovations sometimes move too slowly from the lab to the field. Three new programs have been recently created in DOD to help speed and enhance the transition of new technologies. A report accompanying the fiscal year 2003 National Defense Authorization Act required GAO to review two of these programs--the Technology Transition Initiative (TTI) and Defense Acquisition Challenge Program (DACP). The first is designed to speed transition of technologies from DOD labs to acquisition programs and the second is designed to introduce cost-saving technologies from inside and outside DOD. We were also asked to review the Quick Reaction Fund, which is focused on rapidly field testing promising new technology prototypes. We assessed the impact the programs had on technology transition and the programs' selection, management and oversight, and assessment practices. The ability to spur and leverage technological advances is vital to sustaining DOD's ability to maintain its superiority over others and to improve and even transform how military operations are conducted. The three new transition programs we reviewed are all appropriately targeted on what has been a critical problem in this regard--quickly moving promising technologies from the laboratory and commercial environment into actual use. Moreover, by tailoring processes and criteria to focus on different objectives, whether that may be saving time or money or broadening the industrial base, DOD has had an opportunity to experiment with a variety of management approaches and criteria that can be used to help solve transition problems affecting the approximately $69 billion spent over the past 3 years on later stages of technology development. However, it is too soon for us to determine the impact the three new DOD technology transition programs are having. At the time of our review, the programs--the TTI, DACP, and Quick Reaction Fund--had completed only 11 of 68 projects funded in fiscal years 2003 and 2004; of those, only 4 were providing full capability to users. Additionally, the programs have limited measures to gauge success of individual projects and return on investment. Nonetheless, reports from the programs have pointed to an array of benefits, including quicker fielding of technological improvements, cost savings, and the opportunity for DOD to tap into innovative technologies from firms that are new to defense work. Some sponsored technologies are bringing benefits to warfighters, such as a small, unmanned aircraft that can detect chemical and biological agents, and a device the size of an ink pen that can be used to purify water on the battlefield or in disaster areas. Furthermore, DOD officials credit the programs with giving senior leaders the flexibility to rapidly address current warfighter needs and for highlighting smaller technology projects that might otherwise be ignored. Long-term success for the programs likely will depend on how well the programs are managed and overseen. The programs must have effective processes for selecting the best projects, and management and oversight processes that will catch potential problems early. Thus far, of the three programs, the DACP has adopted the most disciplined and structured process for selecting and managing projects, and has encountered few problems managing projects. However, the program has had some difficulties processing the large number of proposals it receives. The TTI has also established selection criteria and processes, but it is unclear the extent to which it is reaching its intended audience and has had less success in tracking its projects. The Quick Reaction Fund has the least structured processes of the three programs--a deliberate approach seen as providing the flexibility needed to field innovations rapidly. It has had some difficulty selecting, managing and tracking projects.",govreport
"The MAF is a data file that contains a list of all known living quarters in the United States and Puerto Rico. The Bureau uses the MAF to support the decennial census as well as the American Community Survey and other ongoing demographic surveys. The MAF contains address information, census geographic location codes, and source and history data. In conjunction with the MAF, the TIGER contains spatial geographical information that allows information from the MAF to be mapped. For the 2010 Census, the Bureau updated the MAF through a complete address canvassing that verified virtually every existing MAF address and added new addresses and deleted those that no longer exist. While full address canvassing helped ensure the accuracy of the address list, we believe it was also very costly. According to Bureau decision documents leading up to the 2010 Census, the Bureau canceled planned research on the feasibility of targeting its canvassing when prioritizing its research agenda early in the decade given its funding levels. As part of the Bureau’s effort to conduct the 2020 Census at a cost lower than the 2010 Census, the Bureau is researching the feasibility of conducting targeted address canvassing, verifying addresses in only select areas that are more likely to require updates to the address list. To support targeted address canvassing, the Bureau plans to increase its reliance on other previously used sources of updates, including U.S. Postal Service files, commercial database files, and significant input from state and local governments. For example, GSS-I is working to allow government agencies at all levels to more regularly share and update their address lists with the Bureau throughout the decade (rather than solely 2 years prior to the decennial, as had been the case in prior decennial censuses) so that fewer areas need to be fully canvassed. The life cycle for 2020 Census preparation is divided into five phases, as illustrated in figure 1. The Bureau intends to use the early research and testing phase through fiscal year 2015 to develop a proposal for conducting targeted address canvassing that considers both cost and quality implications. By the end of the early research and testing phase, the Bureau plans to complete decisions about preliminary operational designs rather than continuing critical research and testing until the end of the decade as it did for the 2010 Census. The Bureau faces legally mandated deadlines for delivering census tabulations. Effective scheduling is critical for ensuring that the Bureau adheres to a timeline that meets these deadlines. The Bureau relies on schedules to help monitor progress of its many interdependent activities. The schedules are essential to help manage the risks to preparing and implementing a successful decennial census. Certain dates within the schedule could be subject to change or activities may be canceled as a result of time or budget constraints. As dates change from the original schedule or there are significant changes to the work planned, there could be an associated increase in risk as the Bureau may have less time than originally planned to complete future activities in time to make decisions needed to execute the 2020 Census. We determined that a schedule not only provides a road map for systematic execution of a program, but also provides a means by which to gauge progress, identify and address potential problems, and promote accountability. In the GAO Schedule Assessment Guide,four characteristics of a reliable schedule. A schedule should be: Comprehensive: The schedule should identify all activities and resources necessary to accomplish the project. The schedule should cover the scope of work to be performed so that the full picture is available to managers. Well constructed: Activities should be logically sequenced and critical activities that would affect the timelines of the schedule should be identified. Credible: All schedules should be linked to a complete master schedule for managers to reference and analyzed for how risk impacts the outcome of the schedule. Controlled: There should be a documented process for changes to the schedule so that the integrity of the schedule is assured. For a schedule to be reliable, it must substantially or fully meet all criteria for these four characteristics. These characteristics and their criteria are described in more detail in appendix II. We found that the Bureau’s 2020 Research and Testing and GSS-I schedules exhibit some of the characteristics of a reliable schedule, yet important weaknesses remain. Each of the schedules substantially met one of the four characteristics (controlled) and minimally or partially met the other three characteristics (comprehensive, well constructed, and credible) (see table 1). Examples of the extent to which these characteristics were met are provided below. For a more detailed explanation, see appendix III. The Bureau is using a work breakdown structure to guide the activities of the 2020 Research and Testing and GSS-I schedules. A work breakdown structure defines in detail the work necessary to accomplish a program’s objectives. However, not all activities listed in the work breakdown structure are included in the 2020 Research and Testing and GSS-I schedules. For example, in the GSS-I schedule, 20 of the 28 projects have very few activities in them, indicating a lack of detail. Additionally, two MAF-related projects in the 2020 Research and Testing schedule, the MAF Business Rules Improvement project and the Frame Extract Evaluation project, do not have activities assigned to them. If research activities—or any other activities relevant to developing the MAF—are not listed in a schedule, managers may not be able to readily identify causes of delay. According to the Bureau, the schedules are still evolving, these two projects have not yet started or been staffed, and activities and detail will continue to be added to the schedule. For both schedules, the Bureau appeared to record reasonable durations for most activities, helping to ensure that managers can understand the time activities are expected to take and can hold staff who are executing these activities accountable for meeting deadlines. However, neither schedule included information about what levels of resources are required to complete the planned work. Information on resource needs and availability in each work period assists with forecasting the likelihood that activities will be completed as scheduled. Bureau officials stated that they hope to begin the exercise of identifying the resources needed for each activity in both schedules by early 2014 and are waiting for decisions and guidance from the Bureau’s effort to standardize cost estimation practices enterprise-wide. In 2012 we recommended, and the Bureau agreed, that the Bureau establish and communicate a timeline for all enterprise activity However, the Bureau so that decennial managers can plan accordingly.has not yet produced this timeline. In both of the schedules, the Bureau logically linked many of the activities in a sequence. This helps staff identify next steps as they progress through MAF development activities and helps managers identify the impact of changes in one activity on subsequent activities. Yet in both schedules, the Bureau did not identify the preceding and following activity for a number of activities (20 percent for the GSS-I schedule and 9 percent for the 2020 Research and Testing schedule). Scheduling staff were unable to explain why this information was missing. Without this logic, the effect of a change in one activity on future activities cannot be seen in the schedule. For example, in the GSS-I schedule, the “delivery of the targeted address canvassing recommendation report” to managers has no predecessor. According to the Bureau, this report is to outline the research findings, impacts, operational considerations, and benefits of conducting a targeted address canvassing. For those activities that lack predecessors in the schedule, the real effects of changes or delays in preceding activities would not be visible in the schedule, potentially resulting in unforeseen delays in the recommendation report. The Bureau used a large number of constraints which, if used inappropriately, can affect the reliability of the schedule. Activities for which constraints would be justified are Census Day and the delivery of the Apportionment Count, because they have legally mandated deadlines. But, for example, the Bureau also placed a constraint on the delivery of a draft targeted address canvassing report. Such an activity would likely not need a constraint because delays in preceding activities could affect the actual timing of the delivery of the draft report. Placing a constraint on this type of activity would mask in the schedule the effects of any changes or delays that would affect the true delivery date. While our schedule guide states that documenting the justification for constraints is important, the Bureau has not provided justifications in the schedule for its use of constraints. The Bureau told us that justifications are in meeting notes and e-mails, rather than the schedule. If this information is not included in the schedule, the justification for constraints remains unclear to those who did not have access to the meeting notes or e-mails. Also, leaving constraints within the schedule beyond when the schedule is being tested can make the schedule unreliable for other purposes. Additionally, inappropriately used constraints make it difficult to identify the schedules’ “critical path”—the sequence of steps needed to achieve the end goal that, if they slip, could negatively affect the overall project completion date. The absence of a critical path or a poorly constructed one calls into question the reliability of the calculated schedule dates, such as estimates of when research results will be available. When certain constraints are placed on an activity, this can automatically trigger the schedule software to place an activity on the calculated critical path when it might otherwise not be. Because the Bureau used so many constraints and the schedule is missing logic about preceding and following activities, it is possible that the calculated critical path includes activities that are not necessarily germane to the true critical path. Eliminating the unnecessary constraints and including additional logic would provide a more accurate picture of the degree of criticality in the schedule. Until the Bureau can produce a true critical path, it will not be able to provide reliable timeline estimates of effects of schedule changes. This undermines the Bureau’s ability to focus on activities that will have detrimental effects on the progress of designing targeted address canvassing and other 2020 Census decisions. Finally, a critical path with so many activities appearing on it is not useful to managers in identifying what is truly necessary to develop the MAF in a timely manner. For example, within the 2020 Research and Testing schedule, 52 percent of activities not yet completed appear on the calculated critical path. Similarly, for the GSS-I schedule, 19 percent of the activities appear on the calculated critical path, almost half of which could be because constraints are placed on them. Such a large share of activities appearing on the critical path can reduce the flexibility managers have to complete activities in parallel with each other or to reallocate resources when the same resource is needed for multiple activities on the path. The schedules have shortcomings with (1) the integration into management reporting and (2) the ability to automatically change as activities within the schedule change. First, management documents from the 2020 Research and Planning Office indicate the Bureau does not always derive information on milestones from the schedule. For example, two documents dated July 2013 cite the same baseline date from the schedule list major milestones, but the documents indicate a different date for the same part of the research and testing schedule; one states that the research and testing milestones for the current phase will be complete in September 2014, while the other states that these milestones will be completed in September 2015. Bureau managers acknowledged that the planning milestones within the schedule had not been updated to reflect ongoing Bureau management decisions about reprioritizing research and testing plans in light of budget uncertainty during fiscal year 2013. Without keeping the schedule current and using the most recent information to derive information for management such as schedule milestones, there are limited assurances that management is receiving reliable information. Second, we tested the schedules to determine how they changed when dates within the schedule were changed. In our test, the Research and Testing schedule responded automatically to changes in dates of activities, following best practices. However, the GSS-I schedule did not respond in the same way: When we adjusted the date of an activity, subsequent related activities appearing necessary to achieve the milestone did not change, even though the ultimate milestone date changed based on the date shift. More importantly, though, the Bureau is not in a position to carry out systematic quantitative risk analysis on its schedule. A quantitative risk analysis relies on statistical simulation to predict the level of confidence in meeting a program’s completion date. The Bureau has identified risks to MAF development efforts, but a quantitative risk analysis would have the advantage of illustrating the impact of risks on the schedule and how that would affect the Bureau’s ability to meet milestones and provide a measure of how much time contingency should be built in the schedule to help manage certain risks. Bureau officials said they were waiting for decisions about scheduling software before making decisions about conducting a schedule risk analysis. Without a more credible schedule, the Bureau cannot determine the likelihood that information will be available in time to inform decisions about building the MAF; moreover, the Bureau may not be able to fully understand which risks could affect when information will be available to make decisions and the likelihood that the risks could occur. Both schedules were baselined—creating a comparison schedule to measure, monitor, and report the project’s progress—in March 2013, and there is evidence the Bureau has a schedule management process in place and a method for logging changes to the schedule that is in line with best practices. By baselining the schedule, the Bureau helps provide some accountability and transparency to the measurement of the program’s progress. The Bureau has implemented a formal change control process which helps ensure the measurement of meaningful progress through comparisons to past versions of the schedule. The Bureau clearly documented its criteria for justifying changes. A team of senior managers is to approve the change and Bureau teams are to acknowledge the change’s effect if the schedule indicates they will be affected by the change. The Bureau provides narratives that go along with some schedule updates and includes these in monthly status reports, ensuring that management are informed of schedule changes on a regular basis in accordance with leading practices. This practice helps Bureau officials use their schedules to produce reports that can be used to identify work that should have started or finished by that time. Bureau managers acknowledged that not all changes reflecting Bureau decisions on dealing with budget uncertainty have been processed and reflected yet in the schedule. Yet with processes in place—and being used—that ensure the schedule is updated, management can be reasonably assured that it is looking at current data when examining the schedule, contingent upon the accuracy of the updates. In conversations with Bureau officials responsible for managing the 2020 Research and Testing and GSS-I schedules, they said that they had not although staff received training or certification in scheduling practices,have received training in the software they are using for scheduling and many staff have been trained in project management. The scheduling managers referred to GAO’s Schedule Assessment Guide as a key resource for their efforts; however, staff answers to interview questions about leading practices demonstrated a lack of knowledge of the practices. For example, staff explained the presence of the large number of constraints in the schedule they provided to us was related to their occasional “testing” of the schedule, but guidelines for a baselined schedule state that it represents the original configuration of the program plan, and would, thus, not include temporary changes such as the staff described. Both the 2020 Research and Planning Office and the Geography Division have contracted for scheduling support in recent years, and maintain that their contractors have a number of certifications in the advanced use of appropriate software and project management methods. Further, Bureau officials described high turnover and extended vacancies in the management team over the 2020 Research and Planning Office’s scheduling contractors and staff until shortly before we began our audit and obtained a copy of their schedule to review. After we completed our audit work at the Bureau, officials told us that subject to the availability of funding, schedule team members will pursue professional certification to further develop and refine their project scheduling skills. Geography Division managers also stressed to us their commitment to schedule management. GAO, Human Capital: Key Principles for Effective Strategic Workforce Planning, GAO-04-39 (Washington, D.C.: Dec. 11, 2003). We developed the key principles of workforce planning by reviewing documents from organizations with expertise in workforce planning models and federal agencies with promising workforce planning practices, as well as our past work. to achieve programmatic goals. A key principle for strategic workforce planning includes systematically identifying gaps in competencies in staff with the goal of minimizing or eliminating these gaps. Our prior work has shown that organizations can use methods such as training, contracting, staff development, and hiring to help align skills in order to eliminate gaps in competencies needed for mission success. By conducting a workforce planning process that includes an analysis of skills and training needed, such as what the Bureau describes for its scheduling staff in the future, and the identification of gaps to be addressed, the Bureau can better ensure that staff who manage the schedules understand the leading practices and the importance of adhering to them. Thus, the Bureau can better ensure it has the capacity to develop schedules able to support key management decisions. Several divisions are involved in efforts to build the 2020 MAF, making collaboration critical to ensuring that participating divisions work together to achieve the Bureau’s goals. In our past work, we identified leading practices to foster collaborative relationships across organizational boundaries. We determined that four of these practices were directly relevant to the Bureau’s internal efforts to build its MAF. Table 2 identifies and describes these four practices and shows our assessment of the extent to which Bureau documentation demonstrates the Bureau engaged in these leading practices. The Bureau has documented its goals for building a more cost-effective MAF as part of its strategic plans. The Bureau’s 2020 Census Strategic Plan set forth Bureau-wide goals for the MAF and the 2020 Census. These goals provide a common rationale for Bureau teams to work across organizational boundaries. Specifically, the Bureau has documented its intention to improve the coverage and accuracy of the address list; continuously update the address list through the decade; and improve the cost-effectiveness of the address list. The Geography Division and the 2020 Research and Planning Office have incorporated these common outcomes as part of their individual efforts. Officials in these units indicated an understanding of these goals and communicated them to us. Each also documented these goals in their planning documents. For example, the Geography Division’s governance document for GSS-I connects its purpose to working towards building the 2020 MAF. Moreover, in the 2020 Research and Planning Office’s Research and Testing management plan, the Bureau sets goals for the division’s research associated with improving the accuracy and cost-effectiveness of the MAF. The Bureau, through its strategic plan, has set goals for the 2020 MAF, communicating these to organizational units in a way that will help focus the work in support of upcoming design decisions. Similar to its goals, the Bureau has established and documented joint strategies as part of its strategic plans. These strategies help outline how the Bureau will achieve the goals of an accurate, continuously updated and cost-effective MAF. The Bureau’s 2013-2017 Strategic Plan and 2020 Census Strategic Plan specifically identify these strategies for achieving its goals for the MAF: defining components of error in the MAF; assessing how rules for using addresses contained in the MAF should implementing targeted address canvassing; change to accommodate new address sources; and identifying more effective approaches to incorporate addresses from state, local, and tribal governments. The Bureau is executing five research projects related to these strategies. The Bureau is also reinforcing implementation of these strategies by creating new coordination groups as well as placing staff from relevant units on MAF-related research projects. For example, the MAF error model research team has representation from the Geography Division, the Decennial Statistical Studies Division, and the Field Division, among others. The importance of having joint strategies clearly documented is underscored by the differences in perspectives that these divisions can bring to common challenges they may work on together, such as developing a proposal for targeted address canvassing. For example, the Geography Division is responsible for, among other things, administering geographic and cartographic activities needed for the 2020 Census. Its research when working with other teams will focus on geographic concepts, methods, and standards needed for the 2020 Census. Meanwhile, the Field Division, with its responsibility for effectively deploying field personnel to support efficient field data collection, will focus on the “on the ground” feasibility and challenge of targeting certain types of housing units for address canvassing. In addition, coordination bodies are working to share information. In May 2013, relevant Bureau officials began to meet regularly to discuss issues related to implementing targeted address canvassing. Bureau officials involved in these meetings said that the team acts as a vehicle to provide status updates across organizational boundaries. Another team working to identify models to predict where addresses were most in need of being updated was chartered in May 2013. The charter indicated that membership was to include representation from staff in the Field Division and would work with relevant research projects. By defining strategies and reinforcing the collaborative nature of these strategies through such actions as coordination groups and matrixed research teams, the Bureau is helping to align the activities and resources of various divisions to achieve the goals of the 2020 MAF. The Bureau’s 2013-2017 Census Strategic Plan identifies relevant divisions within the Bureau with responsibilities related to developing a more cost-effective 2020 MAF and implementing targeted address canvassing. The 2020 Research and Planning Office has identified the relevant divisions participating in active research projects and coordination groups through documents such as charters. For example, the Targeted Address Canvassing Research, Model, and Area Classification team—a coordination team headed by the Geography Division—was chartered in May 2013 and defines what is both in and out of the scope of its activities. Members are responsible for analyzing potential datasets to be used for targeted address canvassing, but are not responsible for analyzing the costs of targeted address canvassing. In addition, the Bureau recently established memorandums of understanding between the 2020 Research and Planning Office and other relevant divisions, generally finalizing them in May 2013 and signing them in June and July 2013. These agreements are not limited to MAF building efforts, but they provide the broad framework for working together and defining coordination. The agreements define the responsibilities of the 2020 Research and Planning Office and the relevant divisions and include provisions for communication between the two organizational units, resource sharing, and modifying agreements as changes in work dictate. However, the Bureau has not taken advantage of some opportunities to use its schedules to reinforce roles or clarify responsibilities. Detailed schedules for 2020 Research and Testing and GSS-I do not completely reflect roles and responsibilities of other divisions or organizational units, such as by reflecting dependencies of activities or handing off to each other. Information on dependencies between projects is available in the project plans for research projects, but such dependencies are not reflected in the schedules. Bureau officials said they would address this by directing project teams to more clearly identify dependencies on various divisions, and review activities to be flagged as having “external” dependencies within the Research and Testing schedule. The Bureau reinforces individual accountability for collaborative activities through individual performance expectations including both broad ones and others specific to MAF development efforts. Bureau-wide, individuals are rated on their “customer service,” a work competency that includes their performance working in collaboration with those outside of their division to respond to internal and external needs. Managers we spoke with said that collaboration across units within the Bureau is assessed within this competency. Bureau officials also provided examples of performance management plans where staff were to be rated specifically on collaboration. For example, one staff member was expected to attend interdivisional coordination meetings and to implement new projects based on these meetings. The inclusion of specific performance expectations and metrics dependent on collaborative activity can reinforce synergy across organizational boundaries within the Bureau. This should help ensure that individuals with responsibility for developing the MAF have a vested interest in achieving the overall goals set by the Bureau. As the Bureau moves to testing and implementation, roles and responsibilities will change, and the respective roles of divisions may also change in prominence. Continued management attention to follow leading practices for collaboration will help to ensure that collaboration across units is occurring as the Bureau strives to achieve its goal of a more cost- effective 2020 MAF and Census. Planning efforts related to targeted address canvassing and building a more cost-effective MAF are important to the Bureau’s efforts to control the costs of the 2020 decennial. As key design decisions are to be made in the coming years, it is important that the Bureau has a reliable schedule in place upon which management can depend to make those decisions. Our analysis of two Bureau schedules key to MAF development efforts indicates that there are problems with the schedules’ reliability. It will be important to ensure that schedules are comprehensive in order for management to be reasonably assured that they have complete information to make decisions. Similarly, problems with the schedules’ construction mean that the progression of critical events could be unclear to management. Finally, the schedules lack credibility, meaning that risks, including those the Bureau has already identified, could impact the schedules in ways not yet considered. Some of the identified deficiencies indicate that staff and managers have not been available and prepared to sufficiently construct and maintain the schedules. Conducting a workforce planning process of staff working on MAF schedules could help the Bureau to identify staff skills needed to help ensure related gaps are addressed. Without staff knowledge of the leading practices and the importance of adhering to them, the schedules may prove problematic for decennial managers’ ability to assess progress, make decisions, identify future risks, or anticipate potential delays. With its planning documents, memorandums of understanding, and various charters, the Bureau has put in place a framework to support collaborative efforts following leading practices, particularly in recent months, which will aid the efforts. These methods could be bolstered by building collaboration into the schedule. By improving practices in the area of constructing a schedule, the Bureau can help address these gaps. As the Bureau continues its implementation efforts up to and beyond key decisions about how to build a cost-effective MAF, it is vital to ensure that the practices incorporated into Bureau planning documents and processes thus far are continued. To help maintain a more thorough and insightful 2020 Census development schedule in order to better manage risks to a successful 2020 Census, the Secretary of Commerce and Undersecretary of Economic Affairs should direct the U.S. Census Bureau to improve its scheduling practices in three areas: the comprehensiveness of schedules, including ensuring that all relevant activities are included in the schedule; the construction of schedules, including ensuring complete logic is in place to identify the preceding and subsequent activities as well as a critical path that can be used to make decisions; and the credibility of schedules, including conducting a quantitative risk assessment. In addition, we recommend that the Director of the U.S. Census Bureau initiate a robust workforce planning process for those working on schedules related to the Master Address File, including actions such as an analysis of skills needed, to identify and address gaps in scheduling skills. We provided a draft of this report to the Department of Commerce and received the department’s written comments on November 5, 2013. The comments are reprinted in appendix IV. The Department of Commerce concurred with our findings and recommendations and provided several clarifications, which are reflected in this report as appropriate. As agreed with your offices, unless you publicly announce the contents of this report earlier, we plan no further distribution until 30 days from the report date. At that time, we will send copies to the Secretary of Commerce, the Under Secretary of Economic Affairs, the Director of the U.S. Census Bureau, and interested congressional committees. The report also is available at no charge on GAO’s website at http://www.gao.gov. If you have any questions about this report please contact me at (202) 512-2757 or goldenkoffr@gao.gov. Contact points for our Offices of Congressional Relations and Public Affairs may be found on the last page of this report. The GAO staff that made major contributions to this report are listed in appendix V. This report (1) assesses the reliability of the schedules for two key Master Address File (MAF) development programs, and (2) examines the extent to which the Census Bureau (Bureau) is following leading practices for collaboration for its MAF development work. To determine the extent to which the Bureau is following leading practices for scheduling as identified in the GAO Schedule Assessment Guide, we analyzed the Geographic Support System Initiative (GSS-I) schedule and the 2020 Research and Planning Office (Research and Testing) schedule. We scored each scheduling best practice on a five-point scale ranging from “not met” to “fully met.” To determine the extent to which the Bureau’s key efforts to build a cost-effective MAF/Topologically Integrated Geographic Encoding and Referencing (MAF/TIGER) incorporate leading practices for collaboration, we identified leading practices to apply to intra-agency collaborative efforts based on our past work on leading collaboration We identified organizational units and activities relevant to practices.building a cost-effective MAF in consultation with the Bureau. We also identified documentation of their research projects. We reviewed key management documents for content pertaining to collaboration, including the Bureau’s strategic plan for the decennial and current (2013-2017) strategic plan. In addition, we reviewed documents directly addressing coordination efforts, such as charters and meeting minutes from coordination groups and memorandums of understanding between divisions. We compared the documented plans and activities to best practices in order to rate the extent to which leading practices were incorporated or were intended to be incorporated into Bureau documents. We rated each practice on a three-point scale from “Not Documented” to “Generally Documented.” Not Documented: The Bureau provided no documentary evidence that satisfies any of the criteria. Partially Documented: The Bureau provided documentary evidence that satisfies a portion of the criteria. Generally Documented: The Bureau provided documentary evidence that satisfies all or nearly all of the criteria. We then interviewed Bureau officials in the Geography and 2020 Research and Planning Office divisions to discuss schedules and their collaboration efforts. Additionally, regarding scheduling and collaboration, we spoke with relevant officials in the Center for Administrative Records Research and Applications, Decennial Statistical Studies Division, and Field Division. These divisions are participating in some MAF development activities with the Geography and 2020 Research and Planning Office divisions. Our review of scheduling and collaboration practices was limited to 2020 Decennial Census activities and focused on MAF development activities and cannot be generalized to other, non- decennial Bureau activities and operations. Description A schedule should reflect all activities defined in the project’s work breakdown structure and include all activities to be performed by the government and contractor. The schedule should realistically reflect the resources (i.e., labor, material, and overhead) needed to do the work, whether all required resources will be available when needed, and whether any funding or time constraints exist. The schedule should reflect how long each activity will take to execute. The schedule should be planned so that all activities are logically sequenced in the order they are to be carried out. The schedule should identify the critical path, or those activities that, if delayed, will negatively impact the overall project completion date. The critical path enables analysis of the effect delays may have on the overall schedule. The schedule should identify float—the amount of time an activity can slip in the schedule before it affects other activities—so that flexibility in the schedule can be determined. As a general rule, activities along the critical path have the least amount of float. The detailed schedule should be horizontally traceable, meaning that it should link products and outcomes associated with other sequenced activities. The integrated master schedule should also be vertically traceable—that is, varying levels of activities and supporting subactivities can be traced. Such mapping or alignment of levels enables different groups to work to the same master schedule. The schedule should include a schedule risk analysis that uses statistical techniques to predict the probability of meeting a completion date. A schedule risk analysis can help management identify high priority risks and opportunities. Progress updates and logic provide a realistic forecast of start and completion dates for program activities. Maintaining the integrity of the schedule logic at regular intervals is necessary to reflect the true status of the program. To ensure that the schedule is properly updated, people responsible for updating should be trained in critical path method scheduling. A baseline schedule represents the original configuration of the program plan and is the basis for managing the project scope, the time period for accomplishing it, and the required resources. Comparing the current status of the schedule to the baseline can help managers target areas for mitigation.

Because of tight deadlines and the involvement of several different Bureau units in this effort, effective scheduling and collaboration practices are important for the entire process to stay on track. GAO was asked to examine scheduling and collaboration in the Bureau's efforts to develop a more cost-effective MAF. GAO (1) assessed the reliability of the schedules for two key MAF development programs, and (2) examined the extent to which the Bureau is following leading practices for collaboration for its MAF development work. GAO analyzed the schedules for the two programs most relevant to developing the address list, and reviewed strategic plans and other documents establishing coordination mechanisms and compared them to leading practices for intra-agency collaborative efforts. The Census Bureau (Bureau) is not producing reliable schedules for the two programs most relevant to building the Master Address File (MAF)--the 2020 Research and Testing program and the Geographic Support System Initiative. The Bureau did not include all activities in either schedule. The schedules appeared to have reasonable durations for most activities, but they did not include information about required resources. For both schedules, the Bureau logically linked many activities in a sequence. Yet in both schedules the Bureau did not identify the preceding and following activity for a significant number of activities. Without this logic, the effect of a change in one activity on future activities cannot be seen in the schedule, potentially resulting in unforeseen delays. The Bureau is not in a position to carry out a quantitative risk analysis on the schedules. As a result of these issues, the schedules are producing inaccurate dates, which could mislead Bureau managers to falsely conclude that all of the work is on schedule when it may not be. Without reliable schedule information, such as valid forecasted dates and the amount of flexibility remaining in the schedule, management faces challenges in assessing the progress of MAF development efforts and determining what activities most need attention. Staff managing the schedules said that they had not received thorough training or certification on scheduling best practices, and, according to schedule managers, staff turnover contributed to the issues GAO identified. Workforce planning and training can help the Bureau have the skills in place to ensure that characteristics of a reliable schedule are met to support key management decisions. The Bureau has documented collaboration activities that follow many leading practices for collaboration. Because several divisions are involved in efforts to develop the MAF, collaboration across these divisions is critical. In recent months, the Bureau has put in place a variety of mechanisms to aid coordination, such as crosscutting task teams. For example, research projects relevant to developing the MAF have representation from multiple divisions. The Bureau has also established memorandums of understanding across divisions to provide a broad framework for working together. Continued management attention to collaboration practices will help to ensure that collaboration across units is occurring as MAF development continues. GAO recommends that the Census Director take a number of actions to improve the reliability of its schedules, including steps to ensure that all relevant activities are included in the schedules, complete scheduling logic is in place, and a quantitative risk assessment is conducted. In addition, GAO recommends a robust workforce planning effort to identify and address gaps in scheduling skills for staff that work on schedules. The Department of Commerce concurred and suggested several clarifications, which GAO included in the report as appropriate.",govreport
"With an overall goal of developing research that communities need to make sound decisions about how best to prevent and reduce girls’ delinquency, OJJDP established the Girls Study Group (Study Group) in 2004 under a $2.6 million multiyear cooperative agreement with a research institute. OJJDP’s objectives for the group, among others, included identifying effective or promising programs, program elements, and implementation principles (i.e., guidelines for developing programs). Objectives also included developing program models to help inform communities of what works in preventing or reducing girls’ delinquency, identifying gaps in girls’ delinquency research and developing recommendations for future research, and disseminating findings to the girls’ delinquency field about effective or promising programs. To meet OJJDP’s objectives, among other activities, the Study Group identified studies of delinquency programs that specifically targeted girls by reviewing over 1,000 documents in relevant research areas. These included criminological and feminist explanations for girls’ delinquency, patterns of delinquency, and the justice system’s response to girls’ delinquency. As a result, the group identified 61 programs that specifically targeted preventing or responding to girls’ delinquency. Then, the group assessed the methodological quality of the studies of the programs that had been evaluated using a set of criteria developed by DOJ’s Office of Justice Programs (OJP) called What Works to determine whether the studies provided credible evidence that the programs were effective at preventing or responding to girls’ delinquency. The results of the group’s assessment are discussed in the following sections. OJJDP’s effort to assess girls’ delinquency programs through the use of a study group and the group’s methods for assessing studies were consistent with generally accepted social science research practices and standards. In addition, OJJDP’s efforts to involve practitioners in Study Group activities and disseminate findings were also consistent with the internal control standard to communicate with external stakeholders, such as practitioners operating programs. According to OJJDP research and program officials, they formed the Study Group rather than funding individual studies of programs because study groups provide a cost-effective method of gaining an overview of the available research in an issue area. As part of its work, the group collected, reviewed, and analyzed the methodological quality of research on girls’ delinquency programs. The use of such a group, including its review, is an acceptable approach for systematically identifying and reviewing research conducted in a field of study. This review helped consolidate the research and provide information to OJJDP for determining evaluation priorities. Further, we reviewed the criteria the group used to assess the studies and found that they adhere to generally accepted social science standards for evaluation research. We also generally concurred with the group’s assessments of the programs based on these criteria. According to the group’s former principal investigator, the Study Group decided to use OJP’s What Works criteria to ensure that its assessment of program effectiveness would be based on highly rigorous evaluation standards, thus eliminating the potential that a program that may do harm would be endorsed by the group. However, 8 of the 18 experts we interviewed said that the criteria created an unrealistically high standard, which caused the group to overlook potentially promising programs. OJJDP officials stated that despite such concerns, they approved the group’s use of the criteria because of the methodological rigor of the framework and their goal for the group to identify effective programs. In accordance with the internal control standard to communicate with external stakeholders, OJJDP sought to ensure a range of stakeholder perspectives related to girls’ delinquency by requiring that Study Group members possess knowledge and experience with girls’ delinquency and demonstrate expertise in relevant social science disciplines. The initial Study Group, which was convened by the research institute and approved by OJJDP, included 12 academic researchers and 1 practitioner; someone with experience implementing girls’ delinquency programs. However, 11 of the 18 experts we interviewed stated that this composition was imbalanced in favor of academic researchers. In addition, 6 of the 11 said that the composition led the group to focus its efforts on researching theories of girls’ delinquency rather than gathering and disseminating actionable information for practitioners. According to OJJDP research and program officials, they acted to address this issue by adding a second practitioner as a member and involving two other practitioners in study group activities. OJJDP officials stated that they plan to more fully involve practitioners from the beginning when they organize study groups in the future and to include practitioners in the remaining activities of the Study Group, such as presenting successful girls’ delinquency program practices at a national conference. Also, in accordance with the internal control standard, OJJDP and the Study Group have disseminated findings to the research community, practitioners in the girls’ delinquency field, and the public through conference presentations, Web site postings, and published bulletins. The group plans to issue a final report on all of its activities by spring 2010. The Study Group found that few girls’ delinquency programs had been studied and that the available studies lacked conclusive evidence of effective programs; as a result, OJJDP plans to provide technical assistance to help programs be better prepared for evaluations of their effectiveness. However, OJJDP could better address its girls’ delinquency goals by more fully developing plans for supporting such evaluations. In its review, the Study Group found that the majority of the girls’ delinquency programs it identified—44 of the 61—had not been studied by researchers. For the 17 programs that had been studied, the Study Group reported that none of the studies provided conclusive evidence with which to determine whether the programs were effective at preventing or reducing girls’ delinquency. For example, according to the Study Group, the studies provided insufficient evidence of the effectiveness of 11 of the 17 programs because, for instance, the studies involved research designs that could not demonstrate whether any positive outcomes, such as reduced delinquency, were due to program participation rather than other factors. Based on the results of this review, the Study Group reported that among other things, there is a need for additional, methodologically rigorous evaluations of girls’ delinquency programs; training and technical assistance to help programs prepare for evaluations; and funding to support girls’ delinquency programs found to be promising. According to OJJDP officials, in response to the Study Group’s finding about the need to better prepare programs for evaluation, the office plans to work with the group and use the remaining funding from the effort— approximately $300,000—to provide a technical assistance workshop by the end of October 2009. The workshop is intended to help approximately 10 girls’ delinquency programs prepare for evaluation by providing information about how evaluations are designed and conducted and how to collect data that will be useful for program evaluators in assessing outcomes, among other things. In addition, OJJDP officials stated that as a result of the Study Group’s findings, along with feedback they received from members of the girls’ delinquency field, OJJDP plans to issue a solicitation in fiscal year 2010 for funding to support evaluations of girls’ delinquency programs. OJJDP has also reported that the Study Group’s findings are to provide a foundation for moving ahead on a comprehensive program related to girls’ delinquency. However, OJJDP has not developed a plan that is documented, is shared with key stakeholders, and includes specific funding requirements and commitments and time frames for meeting its girls’ delinquency goals. Standard practices for program and project management state that specific desired outcomes or results should be conceptualized, defined, and documented in the planning process as part of a road map, along with the appropriate projects needed to achieve those results, supporting resources, and milestones. In addition, government internal control standards call for policies and procedures that establish adequate communication with stakeholders as essential for achieving desired program goals. According to OJJDP officials, they have not developed a plan for meeting their girls’ delinquency goals because the office is in transition and is in the process of developing a plan for its juvenile justice programs, but the office is taking steps to address its girls’ delinquency goals, for example, through the technical assistance workshop. Developing a plan for girls’ delinquency would help OJJDP to demonstrate leadership to the girls’ delinquency field by clearly articulating the actions it intends to take to meet its goals and would also help the office to ensure that the goals are met. In our July report, we recommended that to help ensure that OJJDP meets its goals to identify effective or promising girls’ delinquency programs and supports the development of program models, the Administrator of OJJDP develop and document a plan that (1) articulates how the office intends to respond to the findings of the Study Group, (2) includes time frames and specific funding requirements and commitments, and (3) is shared with key stakeholders. OJP agreed with our recommendation and outlined efforts that OJJDP plans to undertake in response to these findings. For example, OJJDP stated that it anticipates publishing its proposed juvenile justice program plan, which is to include how it plans to address girls’ delinquency issues, in the Federal Register to solicit public feedback and comments, which will enable the office to publish a final plan in the Federal Register by the end of the year (December 31, 2009). Mr. Chairman, this concludes my statement. I would be pleased to respond to any questions that you or other Members of the Subcommittee may have.

For example, from 1995 through 2005, delinquency caseloads for girls in juvenile justice courts nationwide increased 15 percent while boys' caseloads decreased by 12 percent. More recently, in 2007, 29 percent of juvenile arrests--about 641,000 arrests--involved girls, who accounted for 17 percent of juvenile violent crime arrests and 35 percent of juvenile property crime arrests. Further, research on girls has highlighted that delinquent girls have higher rates of mental health problems than delinquent boys, receive fewer special services, and are more likely to abandon treatment programs. The Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention (OJJDP) is the Department of Justice (DOJ) office charged with providing national leadership, coordination, and resources to prevent and respond to juvenile delinquency and victimization. OJJDP supports states and communities in their efforts to develop and implement effective programs to, among other things, prevent delinquency and intervene after a juvenile has offended. For example, from fiscal years 2007 through 2009, Congress provided OJJDP almost $1.1 billion to use for grants to states, localities, and organizations for a variety of juvenile justice programs, including programs for girls. Also, in support of this mission, the office funds research and program evaluations related to a variety of juvenile justice issues. As programs have been developed at the state and local levels in recent years that specifically target preventing girls' delinquency or intervening after girls have become involved in the juvenile justice system, it is important that agencies providing grants and practitioners operating the programs have information about which of these programs are effective. In this way, agencies can help to ensure that limited federal, state, and local funds are well spent. In general, effectiveness is determined through program evaluations, which are systematic studies conducted to assess how well a program is working--that is, whether a program produced its intended effects. To help ensure that grant funds are being used effectively, you asked us to review OJJDP's efforts related to studying and promoting effective girls' delinquency programs. We issued a report on the results of that review on July 24, 2009. This testimony highlights findings from that report and addresses (1) efforts OJJDP has made to assess the effectiveness of girls' delinquency programs, (2) the extent to which these efforts are consistent with generally accepted social science standards and federal standards to communicate with stakeholders, and (3) the findings from OJJDP's efforts and how the office plans to address the findings. This statement is based on our July report and selected updates made in October 2009. With an overall goal of developing research that communities need to make sound decisions about how best to prevent and reduce girls' delinquency, OJJDP established the Girls Study Group (Study Group) in 2004 under a $2.6 million multiyear cooperative agreement with a research institute.

The Study Group found that few girls' delinquency programs had been studied and that the available studies lacked conclusive evidence of effective programs; as a result, OJJDP plans to provide technical assistance to help programs be better prepared for evaluations of their effectiveness. However, OJJDP could better address its girls' delinquency goals by more fully developing plans for supporting such evaluations.",govreport
"Before 1991, the military services maintained separate finance and accounting operations that were duplicative and inefficient. DFAS was created to standardize DOD finance and accounting policies, procedures, and systems. Military services and defense agencies generally use operations and maintenance appropriations to pay for DFAS services. Before fiscal year 1991, the military services and defense agencies each had their own financial management structure, consisting of a headquarters comptroller organization; finance and accounting centers; and accounting, finance, and disbursing offices at military bases. Each service and agency developed its own processes and systems that were geared to its particular mission. In many instances, the military services and defense agencies interpreted governmentwide and DOD-level finance and accounting policies differently. According to DOD, these variances sometimes resulted in managers being provided conflicting information. Over the years as greater emphasis was placed on joint operations, financial management system incompatibility and lack of standardization (even within a military service) became more apparent. For example, there was only one pay schedule for military personnel, yet DOD maintained and operated dozens of different pay systems. These types of conditions produced business practices that were complex, slow, and error prone. According to DOD officials, no matter how skilled the people operating them, DOD’s financial management systems and processes were inherently handicapped in their efficiency and effectiveness. Furthermore, DOD officials stated that there was an inherent inefficiency in having multiple organizations perform virtually identical functions. Given these problems; changes in the economic, political, and management environments; and advances in technology, DOD officials became convinced they needed to improve the economy and efficiency of their finance and accounting operations. After assessing how finance and accounting activities were performed, DOD determined that consolidating these activities offered a number of potential advantages, including increasing DOD-wide oversight; improving consistency in the application of accounting principles, policies, procedures, systems, and standards throughout DOD; eliminating the costs of maintaining and operating multiple financial operations and systems; improving decision making by providing DOD managers with more timely, meaningful, and accurate financial information; and accelerating the implementation of standard DOD-wide financial systems. The establishment of DFAS in January 1991 was the first step taken by DOD directed at fundamentally reforming finance and accounting operations. DFAS was formed by consolidating into a single agency under DOD’s Comptroller, the large finance and accounting centers that belonged to the military services and the Defense Logistics Agency. Recognizing that additional economies and efficiencies could be achieved, the Deputy Secretary of Defense, in December 1991, directed DFAS to assume control of existing finance and accounting operations and personnel at the command and installation levels within the military services. By 1994, DFAS had assumed responsibility for many of the finance and accounting activities at 332 offices (in the continental United States, Alaska, Hawaii, Guam, Puerto Rico, and Panama) and had announced plans to consolidate these activities at a limited number of DFAS locations. To focus DOD management’s attention on managing the cost of finance and accounting activities, DFAS was designated a Defense Business Operations Fund (DBOF) business area in fiscal year 1992. The concept of DBOF is to promote total cost visibility by charging customers (primarily the military services and defense agencies) for the full cost of providing goods and services. By doing this, DOD hoped that all levels of management would focus their attention on the total costs of carrying out certain critical DOD business operations. DOD anticipated that this would encourage managers to become more conscious of operating costs and make fundamental improvements in how DOD conducts business. In fulfilling DBOF’s concept, DFAS sets the prices it charges the military services and defense agencies and bills them to cover the full cost of its operations. The military services and defense agencies pay for these services primarily with funds from their operations and maintenance appropriations. The 1997 Defense Authorization Act required DOD to conduct a comprehensive study of DBOF and present an improvement plan to the Congress for approval. Pending the results of this study, DOD’s Comptroller, on December 11, 1996, dissolved DBOF and created four working capital funds: (1) Army Working Capital Fund, (2) Navy Working Capital Fund, (3) Air Force Working Capital Fund, and (4) Defense-wide Working Capital Fund. DFAS is part of the Defense-wide Working Capital Fund. The four working capital funds will continue to operate under the revolving fund concept—using the same policies, procedures, and systems as they did under DBOF—and charge customers the full costs of providing goods and services to them. Over the past few years, DOD’s finance and accounting organization and management structure has undergone major changes. For example, DFAS and the military services now share the finance and accounting responsibilities that previously belonged to the military services. Most significantly, however, DFAS has developed a new concept of operations that involves performing most of its finance and accounting operations at consolidated sites rather than at local bases and installations. This has allowed it to reduce the number of locations and personnel needed to perform these operations and to begin standardizing its accounting systems and processes. This section describes the current organizational structure of DOD’s finance and accounting activities and the status of various changes with respect to finance and accounting locations, personnel, budgets, and systems. DFAS and the military services are jointly responsible for carrying out DOD finance and accounting activities. DFAS negotiated a division of responsibility with each military service. Finance and accounting operations are performed by two chains of command within DOD. On one side is DFAS, which reports to the Under Secretary of Defense Comptroller/Chief Financial Officer within the Office of the Secretary of Defense. On the other side are the military services, which are headed by their respective secretary. Each service secretary has an assistant secretary for financial management who directs and manages financial management activities consistent with policies prescribed by the Chief Financial Officer and the service’s implementing directives. As shown in figure 1, the Under Secretary has no direct line of authority to any of the financial management staff within the military services, defense agencies, and DOD field activities. Those staff report through their own organizational structure to their respective unit heads. The Under Secretary and the unit heads report to the Secretary of Defense. The Under Secretary, however, does issue policies, instructions, regulations, and procedures relating to financial management matters and the production of financial statements, which are binding on all DOD activities. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1994 designated the Comptroller as DOD’s Chief Financial Officer. Specific duties of the Comptroller/Chief Financial Officer as specified in the Chief Financial Officers Act include directing, managing, and providing policy guidance and oversight of agency financial management personnel, activities, and operations; developing and maintaining integrated accounting and financial monitoring the financial execution of the agency budgets in relation to actual expenditures and preparing and submitting timely performance reports; and overseeing the recruitment, selection, and training of personnel to carry out agency financial management functions. As mentioned, each service secretary has an assistant secretary for financial management who reports to the service secretary and directs and manages financial management activities consistent with policies prescribed by the Chief Financial Officer and the service’s implementing directives. The assistant secretary for financial management position in each service was established in the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1989. The act delineated many of the responsibilities of the office, including managing financial management activities and operations; directing the preparation of budget estimates; approving any asset management systems, including cash and credit collecting debts; and accounting for property and inventory systems. Because of potentially overlapping responsibilities, DFAS met several times with the military services’ financial managers and their staffs during 1994 to reach agreement on their respective finance and accounting roles. These meetings resulted in “responsibility matrices” that identify the specific activities that will be performed by DFAS and each military service. According to DFAS, the responsibility matrix agreements were driven, to a large extent, by the number of finance and accounting personnel each service had transferred to DFAS. Prior to the negotiations in 1994, for example, the Army had transferred about 75 percent of its finance and accounting people to DFAS. According to Army officials, it kept only a small contingent of managerial accountants at each installation and major command location to interpret accounting reports provided by DFAS to the installation or major command and provide advice to the commander on proper stewardship of public funds. As a result, DFAS and the Army agreed that DFAS would perform just about all of the Army’s financial activities. On the other hand, Air Force and Navy officials stated that they transferred smaller percentages of their staffs (50 and 29 percent, respectively). They took this approach to maintain control of activities they felt were essential to providing service to their military personnel and families, such as computing travel pay or helping uniformed personnel solve pay-related problems. Travel payment, a finance function, is an example where DFAS provides different levels of service to its military customers. In this case, authorization, computation, disbursement, and accounting are performed by either the military services or DFAS. Table 3 identifies the responsible party for each of these steps. DFAS assumed control over the military services' finance centers and some of the activities at 332 military installations. DFAS is currently consolidating all its activities into 5 centers and not more than 21 operating locations. The military services continue to perform their remaining activities at most of the 332 installations. When DFAS was established, it opened a headquarters office in Arlington, Virginia, and assumed management control over the six large finance centers that belonged to the military services and defense agencies. One of these centers was subsequently closed, but the others continue to support the military service or defense agency they supported prior to the formation of DFAS. According to the Director of DFAS, this was done primarily to ensure that support levels to the military services and defense agencies remained at an acceptable level. DFAS also assumed control over many of the people and functions at 332 small finance and accounting offices around the world. To improve operational efficiencies and reduce costs, DFAS has focused a great deal of attention on consolidating the personnel and workload at a small number of locations. In May 1994, for example, the Deputy Secretary of Defense announced plans to move the DFAS workload and many of the people at these 332 locations to either the existing 5 centers or 20 new operating locations. As of September 1996, DFAS had closed 230 (or about 70 percent) of the small accounting offices and opened 17 operating locations. Figure 2 shows the number of finance and accounting offices that DFAS plans to close through fiscal year 1998, when the consolidation is now expected to be completed. Announced for fiscal year 1997 Three of the planned operating locations—Lexington, Kentucky; Newark, Ohio; and Rantoul, Illinois—have not been formally scheduled for opening at this time. The fourth planned operating location, at Memphis, Tennessee, will be under the cognizance of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers until the Corps completes its consolidation of finance and accounting operations around fiscal year 1999. At that time, the Corps will transfer the activity to DFAS. Except for Honolulu, Hawaii; Norfolk, Virginia; Orlando, Florida; and San Antonio, Texas, each operating location provides services to a single military service. Honolulu serves all of the military services; Norfolk serves Navy and Army customers; and both Orlando and San Antonio serve Army and Air Force customers. In addition, Charleston, South Carolina; Pensacola, Florida; and Omaha, Nebraska, provide civilian pay service to all military services and defense agencies. Figure 3 shows the locations of the 5 centers and 21 existing or planned operating locations as of September 30, 1996. The primary customer (military service or defense agency) of each center is shown in parentheses in the figure. Not opened as of September 30, 1996. As discussed in the previous section, each of the military services retained certain functions (e.g., managerial accounting, travel claim computation, and customer service) in order to support local commanders and customers. To do this, the services have maintained some staff at most of the 332 installation-level finance offices. Although there are interfaces and exchanges of information between the staff at these offices and DFAS, organizationally they are not part of DOD’s Comptroller or DFAS’ communities. Rather, they report to and receive budgetary support from the base or installation commander. Civilian and military personnel at these activities are paid from operations and maintenance and military personnel appropriations, respectively. DOD estimated it had 46,000 people performing finance and accounting activities in 1994 and has 40,800 performing these today. 28,000 people were transferred into DFAS, leaving the military services with 18,000 people. DFAS currently has 23,500 employees. The military services do not track the number of finance and accounting personnel they employ, but estimate there are about 17,300. In May 1994, when the Deputy Secretary of Defense announced plans to consolidate finance and accounting operations, he said that the number of people performing these activities should drop from about 46,000 to 23,000 by 1999. As of September 1996, DOD estimates show that there were about 40,800 people performing finance and accounting activities—about 5,200 less than estimated in 1994. However, there is some uncertainty about these numbers primarily because the military services do not centrally budget for or manage finance and accounting operations. As a DBOF entity that is now part of the new Defense-wide Working Capital Fund, DFAS tracks the number of personnel it employs so that it can accurately charge its customers for the full cost of operations. Therefore, it generally knows how many people it inherited from the military services and its current on-board strength. DFAS officials told us, for example, that by 1994 DFAS had assumed control of 28,000 personnel—about 10,000 at the 5 large finance centers and about 18,000 at the 332 small, installation-level finance and accounting offices. As of September 1996, this workforce had been reduced to 23,500 and DFAS has plans to eliminate another 3,500 positions by the year 2000. According to DOD, most of these reductions are (or will be) made possible by economies of scale achieved by closing the 332 small finance and accounting offices and consolidating activities at the 5 centers and 21 operating locations. Finance and accounting personnel and activities in the military services, however, are budgeted for and controlled at the installation level. Consequently, service representatives said there were no specific plans to centrally assess or reduce the size of their finance and accounting network. For this reason, they were also uncertain of the number of people that remained after DFAS assumed control of resources in 1994 or that are currently onboard. According to DOD, however, there should have been about 18,000 finance and accounting personnel left with the military services in 1994. In 1992, DFAS and the military services issued a data call to all installation-level finance offices, and in 1994, estimated that the total number of people in DOD’s network was about 46,000. On the basis of this estimate, DFAS assumed control of 28,000 people, leaving about 18,000 people in the military services. To determine the number of people in the current military service network, the services (at our request) either issued another data call to their installations or prepared an estimate based on other available information. They reported to us that, as of September 30, 1996, approximately 17,300 people were performing finance and accounting activities in the military services. On the basis of a comparison of the original data call and the current estimate, about 700 fewer people are performing finance and accounting activities now than DOD officials believe were doing so when DFAS completed its transfer process in 1994. Figure 4 shows the number of finance and accounting personnel reported to us by DFAS and the military services as of September 30, 1996. This includes 589 personnel in the Marine Corps. The total budget for DOD finance and accounting activities is unknown but exceeds $2 billion. DFAS' 1996 budget was $1.64 billion. The military services estimate their personnel costs for fiscal year 1996 at $598 million. The vast majority of the funds come from operations and maintenance appropriations. Information that was provided by DFAS and the military services indicates that DOD budgeted at least $2 billion in fiscal year 1996 to support finance and accounting activities. This estimate includes all DFAS costs plus estimated personnel costs in the military services. Because military service finance and accounting activities are budgeted at local installations and bases in various appropriation accounts, the military services were unable to estimate other finance and accounting-related costs such as training, equipment, supplies, and overhead. As part of the new Defense-wide Working Capital Fund, DFAS does not receive an appropriation. Instead, it bills customers, primarily the military services, for the cost of operations. These bills include charges for direct labor costs related to the performance of finance and accounting functions; indirect costs, such as systems support and depreciation expenses; and overhead costs, such as management support and electricity bills. The bills may also include additional charges or reductions to make up for prior year losses or gains. The military services use their operations and maintenance appropriations to pay the bills. Figure 5 shows DFAS’ financial operations budget from fiscal years 1991 through 1996 and the projected budget for fiscal years 1997 through 2000—the numbers are in constant 1996 dollars. As shown in figure 5, DFAS’ budget for finance and accounting increased from $339 million (in 1996 dollars) in fiscal year 1991 to about $1.64 billion in fiscal year 1996, primarily as a result of an increase in its scope of operations. In fiscal year 1991, for example, DFAS was in operation for only 9 months and was only supporting the finance centers. In fiscal year 1992, DFAS became a DBOF entity and began to identify and charge the military services for the full cost of its operations. For example, system support (e.g., computer hardware and software) costs that had been part of the Defense Information Systems Agency budget in the past were included in the DFAS budget. In fiscal year 1993, DFAS began to assume control of the 332 installation-level finance and accounting offices, and in 1994, DFAS began renovating buildings at the new operating locations. Between fiscal years 1996 and 2000, DFAS estimates its budget will decrease by about 10 percent—from $1.64 billion in fiscal year 1996 to $1.47 billion in 2000 in constant 1996 dollars. According to DFAS officials, the decrease reflects a leveling off of depreciation expenses associated with capital expenditures (such as new computer systems), a drop in workload as DOD continues to downsize its military force structure, and the completion of personnel and workload consolidations from the small finance and accounting offices to DFAS centers and operating locations. The military services’ finance and accounting activities are funded through annual operation and maintenance appropriations. Because these appropriations are allocated to many different budget categories at the installation level, military service officials were not able to estimate the total amount budgeted to support their finance and accounting activities. On the basis of the estimated number of personnel that are currently performing finance and accounting activities, the services estimated that for fiscal year 1996 they budgeted about $598 million in personnel costs. Figure 6 shows the personnel costs each of the military services estimated it incurred during fiscal year 1996. DFAS is responsible for reducing the number of finance and accounting systems used throughout DOD. Since 1991, the number of DOD's reported finance and accounting systems has been reduced from 324 to 217. The military services continue to operate hundreds of feeder systems for which DFAS has no responsibility. As part of its mission, DFAS is responsible for standardizing the finance and accounting systems used throughout DOD. When it was established, for example, DFAS reported that it inherited 127 finance and 197 accounting systems that were in use throughout DOD. In general, DOD defines finance systems as those used to process payments to DOD personnel, retirees, annuitants, and contractors, and accounting systems as those relied on to track appropriations and record operating and capital expenses. In accordance with DOD Financial Management Regulations (DOD 7000.14-R, Volume 1), DFAS, however, does not recognize or include in its inventory several hundred “feeder systems”—systems used to initially record financial data, such as logistics, inventory, and personnel systems—as finance and accounting systems. Yet these feeder systems, which are under the control and operations of the military services and defense agencies, are the source of much of the information that is needed to adequately account for DOD’s assets and operations. DFAS embarked on what it calls a migration system strategy to reduce the number of DFAS finance and accounting systems. Under this strategy, which is depicted in figure 7, DFAS plans to gradually reduce the number of systems used in each functional area (e.g., civilian payroll, military payroll, and accounting) until it eventually arrives at systems that would be used DOD-wide for each finance and accounting area. While the completion of this strategy varies by system and functional area, DFAS estimates that about 49 percent of its current systems (107 of 217) will be eliminated by 2000. . . . . . . This migration strategy typically involves (1) selecting one of the legacy systems from each service, (2) implementing the system servicewide, (3) selecting the best interim migratory system to be DOD’s standard migratory system, and (4) enhancing the migratory system until it meets all DOD requirements. As shown in table 4, DFAS has reduced the reported number of finance systems from 127 to 67 (a 47-percent reduction) and accounting systems from 197 to 150 (a 24-percent reduction). By the year 2000, DFAS estimates that the number of systems will be further reduced to 110—43 finance and 67 accounting systems. Table 4 also shows the number of finance and accounting locations where these systems were used as of September 30, 1996. On the basis of the information presented in table 4, DFAS has been successful in reducing the number of systems in several areas, particularly those where the military services had already consolidated activities at a small number of locations. When DFAS was formed, for example, each of the military services was already operating standard retiree and annuitant pay systems at its respective finance centers. After evaluating the relative capabilities of these systems, DFAS selected the Navy’s retiree pay system and the Air Force’s annuitant pay system as DOD-wide migratory systems. DFAS subsequently integrated these two systems into one system and pays all retirees from the Cleveland center and all annuitants from the Denver center. DFAS and the military services account for monies from four primary sources. Finance and accounting operations are divided into nine functional areas. DOD’s $240-billion appropriation for fiscal year 1996 was used to pay about 6 million people and about 17 million invoices charged to nearly 12 million contracts. The appropriation also supported the operation of 13 DBOF (now working capital fund) business areas such as depot maintenance, commissaries, distribution depots, and DFAS. In addition, in fiscal year 1996, DOD received about $10 billion through its foreign military sales programs and about $12 billion through the operation of base activities such as child care facilities, golf courses, and the Armed Forces Exchanges. To process financial transactions and account for the receipt and expenditure of funds, DFAS and military services’ finance and accounting operations are generally divided into nine functional activities. Table 5 lists these activities, the reported number of DFAS personnel involved in the activity, and the reported total cost for DFAS to process the transactions in fiscal year 1996. The military services were unable to provide us with comparable information. A more detailed description of the sources and uses of DOD funds and the finance and accounting responsibilities of DFAS and the military services is presented in appendix I. We requested comments on a draft of this report from the Secretary of Defense. On January 15, 1997, officials from the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense Comptroller/Chief Financial Officer and representatives of DFAS, the Air Force, the Army, and the Navy met with us to discuss the report. In general, DOD officials agreed with our description of DOD’s finance and accounting structure and organization. They provided us with some suggested changes, which we have incorporated in our final report where appropriate. We performed our review from July 1996 through January 1997 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. Appendix II contains a description of our scope and methodology. We are sending copies of this report to the Chairmen and Ranking Minority Members of the Senate and House Committees on Appropriations; Senate Committee on Armed Services; House Committee on National Security; Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs; House Committee on Government Reform and Oversight; the Director, Office of Management and Budget; the Secretary of Defense; and other interested parties. We will make copies available to others on request. If you or your staff have any questions concerning this report, please contact either James E. Hatcher on (513) 258-7959 or Geoffrey B. Frank on (202) 512-9518. Major contributors to this report are listed in appendix III. This appendix provides an overview of the Department of Defense’s (DOD) finance and accounting operations. DOD has focused its accounting operations primarily on monitoring and controlling the obligation and expenditure of budgetary resources. As discussed in the following sections, DOD carries out these accounting operations for four types of funds —general, working capital, nonappropriated, and security assistance. With the enactment of the Chief Financial Officers Act (CFO) of 1990, the Congress called for audited agency financial statements that would more fully disclose a federal entity’s financial position and results of operations beginning with fiscal year 1996. Such statements are intended to provide for (1) better information for more informed decisions on allocation of budgetary resources and (2) an annual assessment of an agency’s financial performance, including the effectiveness of its execution of its stewardship responsibilities. DOD officials have forthrightly acknowledged that serious financial management problems severely hamper their ability to effectively carry out the full range of accounting and financial reporting responsibilities called for in the CFO Act. DOD has struggled to put in place the financial management operations and controls required to produce the information it needs to ensure adequate accountability and to support decision making. For example, few of DOD’s accounting systems are now integrated with its finance systems or with other systems or databases relied on to carry out its accounting and financial reporting responsibilities. Consequently, DOD prepares required financial reports to account for an estimated 80 percent of its physical assets based on management systems that were not intended for such accounting and financial reporting. The absence of a fully integrated general ledger-controlled system necessitates DOD’s reliance on labor-intensive, error-prone processes to ascertain whether all required items are accounted for and reported. Largely as a result of the CFO Act and other recent legislative initiatives directed at increasing financial management discipline throughout the federal government, DOD has recently begun efforts to broaden the focus of and to bring greater discipline to its accounting operations. DOD’s Chief Financial Officer stated that the CFO Act “has contributed to the recognition and understanding of the scope and depth of the financial management problems that DOD faces and has defined a standard by which the Department can measure its progress.” DOD has characterized its blueprint for financial management reform as the most comprehensive reform of financial management systems and practices in its history. In its efforts to improve its accounting activities, DOD is guided by a set of comprehensive standards that were developed by the Federal Accounting Standards Advisory Board. This Board, which was established in October 1990 by the Comptroller General of the United States, the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, and the Secretary of the Treasury Department, recommends accounting standards after considering the financial and budgetary information needs of the Congress, executive agencies, and other users and comments from the public. The Office of Management and Budget, Treasury, and GAO then decide whether to adopt the recommended standards; if they do, the standards are published by the Office of Management and Budget and GAO and become effective. Recently, a set of comprehensive accounting standards was approved by the three agencies. The new accounting standards and accompanying reporting concepts are central to effectively meeting the financial management improvement goals of the CFO Act of 1990, as amended. Also, improved financial information is necessary to support the strategic planning and performance measurement requirements of the Government Performance and Results Act of 1993. DOD accounting personnel are responsible for accounting for funds received through congressional appropriations, the sale of goods and services by working capital fund businesses, revenue generated through nonappropriated fund activities, and the sales of military systems and equipment to foreign governments or international organizations. Figure I.1 shows the types of funds and the sources and uses of the funds. General funds, the largest category of funds the Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS) must account for, involve monies provided to DOD through congressional appropriations for military personnel; operation and maintenance; military construction; procurement; and research, development, test and evaluation. The Congress appropriated over $240 billion to DOD for fiscal year 1996. Because some of these appropriations involve multiyear funds, DFAS accounted for $338.5 billion in obligated and unobligated balances in general funds monies during fiscal year 1996. As of September 30, 1996, DFAS was required to account for $74.6 billion in obligated and unobligated balances generated by 13 working capital fund (formally DBOF) business areas. These business areas include such activities as depot maintenance, commissaries, distribution depots, and DFAS. In general, these business activities are intended to operate by selling goods and services to the military services and defense agencies at the cost incurred in providing the good or service. Many of the services provided through these business areas, such as the overhaul of ships, tanks, and aircraft, are essential to maintaining the military readiness of our country’s weapon systems. Working capital fund customers pay for the goods and services, primarily, with operations and maintenance funds appropriated by the Congress. DOD’s nonappropriated funds result primarily from the sale of goods and services to DOD military personnel, their dependents, and other qualified persons. Nonappropriated fund activities are divided into two major types—morale, welfare, and recreation activities and the Armed Forces Exchanges. In fiscal year 1995, DOD reported morale, welfare, and recreation activities and Armed Forces Exchanges revenues of $2.5 billion and $9.4 billion, respectively (according to a DOD official, 1996 revenues are expected to be about the same). DFAS, however, has accounting responsibility for only a limited portion of the nonappropriated activities. In fiscal year 1996, DFAS accounted for about $500 million in nonappropriated funds. Morale, welfare, and recreation activities are essentially small businesses such as libraries, gyms, golf courses, child care centers, and officers’ clubs that operate at numerous military installations worldwide. Armed Forces Exchanges are located on military installations worldwide and operate similarly to commercial retail outlets. The exchanges offer a variety of goods and services from military uniforms to fast food. DFAS has accounting responsibility only for a portion of the Army morale, welfare, and recreation workload. The Air Force, the Navy, and the Marine Corps account for these activities through their own nonappropriated fund organizations that are not part of the military service finance and accounting offices. The Armed Forces Exchanges are not included in DFAS’ or the military services’ finance and accounting office workload. DOD also has responsibility for security assistance funds used for congressionally approved sales of military weapon systems and equipment to foreign governments. In some cases, funds accounted for in the security assistance program are received from foreign governments. In addition, the Congress appropriates funds that countries can use as loans or grants to make these purchases. In fiscal year 1996, DOD reported that the security assistance program generated almost $10 billion in new sales. Because many foreign military sales involve procurements over a number of years, in total, DFAS accounted for about $28 billion in obligated and unobligated balances in security assistance funds in fiscal year 1996. DOD’s finance activities generally involve paying the salaries of its employees, paying retirees and annuitants, reimbursing its employees for travel-related expenses, paying contractors and vendors for goods and services, and collecting debts owed to DOD. This section describes DFAS’ and the military services’ involvement in each of these activities. Includes 28 locations and 21 Foreign National Civilian pay systems. Currently, DFAS pays the salaries of 826,000 civilians and about 3 million military personnel. In order for DFAS to pay DOD personnel, it receives information from three sources—military and civilian personnel offices, customer service representatives, and field finance offices or timekeepers within the employee’s unit. Figure I.2 shows an overview of the process by which DFAS obtains information to disburse and account for salary payments made to all DOD employees. The civilian and military pay processes begin with the military service’s personnel office establishing a record in its personnel system for a new hire or recruit by entering personal data such as name, address, and salary. Since the majority of the military services’ personnel systems are not integrated with the payroll systems DFAS uses, entitlement data are sent to DFAS payroll systems through an electronic interface. This interface allows DFAS to establish a pay account for the civilian or military employee. Throughout a person’s employment with DOD, timekeepers, who are usually administrative support personnel or supervisors in a military unit or office, or field finance office staff, submit time and attendance information directly to DFAS. This information is used by DFAS to compute the amount each employee should be paid. After payments are made, the payroll system transmits disbursement information to DFAS accounting units where accounting records are updated and management and budgetary reports are distributed to DOD and external agencies. DFAS also receives information that affects civilian and military pay from customer service representatives. DFAS and the military services’ finance personnel share the responsibility of providing customer service to civilian employees and military members. Customer service duties include input of employee initiated transactions such as bonds, tax withholdings, and address changes; resolving pay-related problems; and responding to inquiries on all aspects of the payment process, such as pay computation and the recording and balancing of annual and sick leave. DFAS assumed retiree and annuitant pay responsibilities from the military services upon its establishment in 1991. In fiscal year 1996, DFAS processed payments to about 2 million retirees and annuitants. Figure I.3 provides an overview of the retiree and annuitant payroll process, identifying duties specific to DFAS and the military services. The military services’ personnel offices process the paperwork required for establishing a retiree pay account. This information is sent electronically to the DFAS Cleveland center where personnel in retired pay operations verify that the retiree’s account has been deleted from the military pay systems (to avoid dual payments to the retiree); compute the retiree’s pay; disburse payment to the retiree; and forward pay information to a DFAS accounting unit that updates accounting records and distributes management and budgetary reports. Upon receipt of a death notice, retired pay operations personnel in Cleveland will suspend or terminate the retirement pay account and electronically transfer the case to the Denver center. Denver personnel in the annuity pay office maintain the annuitant’s pay account, issue surviving annuity payment, provide customer service support, and update accounting records. These personnel also annually verify the annuitant’s eligibility status. Factors that affect entitlement eligibility include, but are not limited to, changes in Social Security benefits, remarriage, and age of children. The travel payment process for both DOD civilian and military employees can be broken down into three stages—travel authorization, actual travel, and travel settlement. Military service finance personnel are involved in the travel authorization process and, in some cases, the travel settlement process. DFAS performs the majority of the responsibilities in the travel settlement step in which the traveler is reimbursed. Annually, DFAS processes about 2.1 million travel settlements. Figure I.4 provides an overview of the travel payment process, distinguishing between activities performed by DFAS and the military services. The travel pay process begins when a DOD employee or supervisor identifies a need for travel. The employee prepares and submits a travel request and cost estimate to the appropriate superior for approval. The administrative support staff within the organization reviews the approved request, obligates funds, and issues a travel order. The administrative support staff includes personnel who have authority to input obligations into the record and may, for example, be personnel in the finance, resource management, or budget offices. At this time, the employee makes travel arrangements and may receive a travel advance through the use of an official government travel card or, when no other means is available, from the appropriate disbursement office. Upon completion of travel, the employee submits a travel voucher to his/her supervisor for reimbursement of expenses, attaching supporting documentation such as receipts. Once the supervisor approves the claim, it is sent to either a DFAS travel pay office or the military service’s finance office where the traveler’s entitlement is computed and an audit is conducted. After entitlement is computed, DFAS or the appropriate military disbursement office makes payment, and DFAS updates the accounting records to reflect the disbursement. DOD finance and accounting personnel are also responsible for making payments to contractors for goods and services such as the production of weapon systems, the purchase of computer equipment, and the shipment of freight and personal property. DFAS has the primary responsibility for processing the transactions, paying the contractor or vendor, and accounting for the disbursement of funds. Military service finance personnel are involved to the extent that they verify that funds are available for use and they enter information into accounting systems to show that funds have been committed or obligated for various goods and services. In fiscal year 1996, DFAS employees made payments on approximately 17 million invoices submitted by contractors and vendors. As shown in figure I.5, while variations exist, the process of acquiring goods and services starts outside of the finance and accounting community, usually with a program manager issuing a request for a procurement of an item or the shipment of freight. Once a requirement for a good or service has been identified, personnel from a military service finance office are contacted to ensure that funds are available for use. If funds are available, the finance personnel set up a commitment on their accounting system. If the supply office has the needed item, it is issued to the requestor. If it is not available through a supply office, the contracting office awards a contract for high-dollar value items or the military service finance office establishes a purchase order for lower value items. For the movement of freight and personal property, DOD either provides the service using its own resources or generates a government bill of lading for the service. Once a supply item is ordered or service has been contracted for, the vendor delivers or performs the service and sends an invoice to the appropriate DFAS office for payment. A receiving report is sent by the requestor to the same office to show that the delivery was received. Personnel at each DFAS location are responsible for matching contract, invoice, and receiving report information prior to making a payment to a contractor/vendor. After a payment is made, accounting personnel at the operating locations are responsible for activities such as matching payment information against obligations and providing status of funds information to the military services. $183 million Federal law requires that all government agencies pursue collection action against individuals or contractors that owe the government money. Within DOD, these debts can result from a wide variety of transactions such as defaulted loans (education or small business) or for various overpayments of pay and benefits. If an individual is employed by DOD or receiving any compensation payment, the military service finance offices attempt to collect the money or process an offset against the individual’s pay account. If the individual is no longer employed by DOD or is not receiving any compensation payment, it is considered an out-of-service debt and DFAS personnel are responsible for collecting the debt. DFAS is also responsible for collecting all debts owed by contractors. As of September 30, 1996, about 319,000 military and civilian debtors owed DOD $464 million and approximately 2,500 contractors owed DOD about $3.5 billion. DFAS personnel closed about 116,000 cases as of the end of fiscal year 1996 during which time they collected approximately $238 million. The military services perform debt management activities at each of their installations. However, we were unable to obtain information related to the number of cases that were processed during fiscal year 1996. Figure I.6 provides an overview of the process used by DOD to collect debts. Upon the initial identification of a debt, many military installation-level organizations, such as a hospital, attempt to collect the debt. If the debt is determined to be uncollectible and is owed by a contractor or someone no longer working for DOD, it is sent to a DFAS center for collection. DFAS is required to send three letters—30 days apart—to debtors in an attempt to collect the money. Then, if the money has not been collected, it can be turned over to a private agency for collection or to the Internal Revenue Service for a potential tax refund offset. The debt may also be sent to the Department of Justice for legal action if research shows the debtor has the ability to pay. If DFAS determines that an individual debtor is employed by another federal agency, it can obtain payment for the outstanding debt through payroll deductions. At any time during the process, the debt can be collected in full, compromised to a lesser amount with the remainder written off, or written off in total if the debt falls below established dollar thresholds. DFAS updates its accounting records to reflect any of these events and reports the information back to the military services. If any debt is collected, it is refunded to the military service that incurred the debt or deposited into the Treasury Miscellaneous Receipts Account. The Subcommittee on Defense, Senate Committee on Appropriations, asked us to provide an overview of DOD finance and accounting activities. We focused our work on describing how DOD is organized to perform finance and accounting, the size of the finance and accounting infrastructure, and the various activities that are performed by DFAS and the military services. To determine how DOD is organized to perform finance and accounting activities, we reviewed documents that discussed the rationale for centralizing accounting activities within DFAS and DFAS and military service finance and accounting organizational charts. We also discussed the organizational structure with officials at DFAS Headquarters and the military services’ Office of the Assistant Secretary for Financial Management. To determine the current size of DOD’s finance and accounting infrastructure, we obtained and reviewed budget, personnel, workload, and cost figures provided by DFAS. The military services did not have comparable information readily available. Therefore, officials from the Army’s and the Marine Corps’ financial management offices sent out a data call to their respective installations to obtain information on the number of personnel currently performing finance and accounting activities. The Air Force updated personnel figures obtained from DOD’s central personnel database. The Navy updated its personnel figures using a variety of Navy reports and DOD’s central personnel database. From these numbers, each of the services estimated the amount of money it spends on personnel costs to perform finance and accounting activities. Given our overall assignment objectives and the descriptive nature of our report, we did not verify the data provided to us by either DFAS or the military services. For purposes of this report, we did not obtain information from defense agencies related to how many personnel are currently performing finance and accounting activities. This decision was based on the lack of a single focal point within DOD that could provide us with the needed information from approximately 24 defense agencies and the small number of personnel involved with defense agency finance and accounting activities prior to the establishment of DFAS in 1991. To determine the type of activities DOD finance and accounting personnel are responsible for performing, we reviewed DOD’s Chief Financial Officer Financial Management 5-Year Plan, the DFAS Customer Service Plan, the responsibility matrices negotiated by DFAS with each of the military services, and work flow descriptions for each finance and accounting activity. To supplement information included in formal reports, we interviewed headquarters and field officials at the following locations: DFAS headquarters in Arlington, Virginia; DFAS centers in Cleveland, Ohio; Columbus, Ohio; Denver, Colorado; and Indianapolis, Indiana; the Army’s and the Navy’s Office of the Assistant Secretary for Financial Management in Arlington, Virginia; the Air Force’s Secretary of the Air Force (Financial Management and Plans) in Arlington, Virginia; and the Marine Corps’ Office of the Deputy Chief of Staff for Program and Resources in Arlington, Virginia.

GAO reported that: (1) Before fiscal year 1991, the military services and defense agencies independently managed their finance and accounting operations. Because these decentralized operations were highly inefficient and failed to produce reliable information for decision makers, DOD created DFAS to consolidate, standardize, and integrate finance and accounting operations. DFAS inherited 26,000 finance and accounting personnel but about 18,000 personnel remained with the military services to perform managerial accounting and customer service activities at local installations and bases. (2) By the end of fiscal year 1998, DFAS expects that all 332 installation-related finance and accounting offices will be closed and their operations transferred to 5 large centers and no more than 21 new operating locations. This consolidation will help DFAS, between fiscal years 1996 and 2000, reduce its budget from $1.64 billion to about $1.47 billion (in constant 1996 dollars); its personnel from 23,500 to about 20,000; and the number of finance and accounting systems from 217 to about 110. The military services reported that they still have close to 17,000 personnel in their finance and accounting network and are not planning any specific reductions. (3) DOD's finance and accounting activities are generally divided into 9 functional areas (accounting, payroll, contract payments, etc.). Improving these areas is an enormous task, involving the replacement of many antiquated systems and processes. The task is even move difficult considering the volume of transaction that must be continued while improvements are being made. Annually, for example, DOD disburses around $260 billion on 17 million invoices, 6 million payroll accounts, and 2 million travel vouchers.",govreport
"An enterprise architecture is a blueprint that describes the current and desired state of an organization or functional area in both logical and technical terms, as well as a plan for transitioning between the two states. Enterprise architectures are a recognized tenet of organizational transformation and IT management in public and private organizations. Without an enterprise architecture, it is unlikely that an organization will be able to transform business processes and modernize supporting systems to minimize overlap and maximize interoperability. The concept of enterprise architectures originated in the mid-1980s; various frameworks for defining the content of these architectures have been published by government agencies and OMB. Moreover, legislation and federal guidance requires agencies to develop and use architectures. For more than a decade, we have conducted work to improve agency architecture efforts. To this end, we developed an enterprise architecture management maturity framework that provides federal agencies with a common benchmarking tool for assessing the management of their enterprise architecture efforts and developing improvement plans. An enterprise can be viewed as either a single organization or a functional area that transcends more than one organization (e.g., financial management, homeland security). An architecture can be viewed as the structure (or structural description) of any activity. Thus, enterprise architectures are basically systematically derived and captured descriptions—in useful models, diagrams, and narrative. More specifically, an architecture describes the enterprise in logical terms (such as interrelated business processes and business rules, information needs and flows, and work locations and users) as well as in technical terms (such as hardware, software, data, communications, and security attributes and performance standards). It provides these perspectives both for the enterprise’s current or “as-is” environment and for its target or “to- be” environment, as well as a transition plan for moving from the “as-is” to the “to-be” environment. The importance of enterprise architectures is a basic tenet of both organizational transformation and IT management, and their effective use is a recognized hallmark of successful public and private organizations. For over a decade, we have promoted the use of architectures, recognizing them as a crucial means to a challenging end: optimized agency operations and performance. The alternative, as our work has shown, is the perpetuation of the kinds of operational environments that burden most agencies today, where a lack of integration among business operations and the IT resources supporting them leads to systems that are duplicative, poorly integrated, and unnecessarily costly to maintain and interface. Employed in concert with other important IT management controls (such as portfolio-based capital planning and investment control practices), architectures can greatly increase the chances that the organizations’ operational and IT environments will be configured so as to optimize mission performance. During the mid-1980s, John Zachman, widely recognized as a leader in the field of enterprise architecture, identified the need to use a logical construction blueprint (i.e., an architecture) for defining and controlling the integration of systems and their components. Accordingly, Zachman developed a structure or framework for defining and capturing an architecture, which provides for six perspectives or “windows” from which to view the enterprise. Zachman also proposed six abstractions or models associated with each of these perspectives. Zachman’s framework provides a way to identify and describe an entity’s existing and planned component parts and the parts’ relationships before the entity begins the costly and time-consuming efforts associated with developing or transforming itself. Since Zachman introduced his framework, a number of frameworks have emerged within the federal government, beginning with the publication of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) framework in 1989. Since that time, other federal entities have issued frameworks, including the Department of Defense (DOD) and the Department of the Treasury. In September 1999, the federal Chief Information Officers (CIO) Council published the Federal Enterprise Architecture Framework (FEAF), which was intended to provide federal agencies with a common construct for their architectures, thereby facilitating the coordination of common business processes, technology insertion, information flows, and system investments among federal agencies. The FEAF described an approach, including models and definitions, for developing and documenting architecture descriptions for multi-organizational functional segments of the federal government. More recently, OMB established the Federal Enterprise Architecture Program Management Office (FEAPMO) to develop a federal enterprise architecture according to a collection of five reference models (see table 1). These models are intended to facilitate governmentwide improvement through cross-agency analysis and the identification of duplicative investments, gaps, and opportunities for collaboration, interoperability, and integration within and across government agencies. OMB has identified multiple purposes for the Federal Enterprise Architecture, such as the following: informing agency enterprise architectures and facilitating their development by providing a common classification structure and vocabulary; providing a governmentwide framework that can increase agency awareness of IT capabilities that other agencies have or plan to acquire, so that they can explore opportunities for reuse; helping OMB decision makers identify opportunities for collaboration among agencies through the implementation of common, reusable, and interoperable solutions; and providing the Congress with information that it can use as it considers the authorization and appropriation of funding for federal programs. Although these post-Zachman frameworks differ in their nomenclatures and modeling approaches, each consistently provides for defining an enterprise’s operations in both logical and technical terms, provides for defining these perspectives for the enterprise’s current and target environments, and calls for a transition plan between the two. Several laws and regulations address enterprise architecture. For example, the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996 directs the CIOs of major departments and agencies to develop, maintain, and facilitate the implementation of information technology architectures as a means of integrating agency goals and business processes with information technology. Also, OMB Circular A-130, which implements the Clinger-Cohen Act, requires that agencies document and submit their initial enterprise architectures to OMB and that agencies submit updates when significant changes to their enterprise architectures occur. The circular also directs OMB to use various reviews to evaluate the adequacy and efficiency of each agency’s compliance with the circular. We began reviewing federal agencies’ use of enterprise architectures in 1994, initially focusing on those agencies that were pursuing major systems modernization programs that were high risk. These included the National Weather Service systems modernization, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) air traffic control modernization, and the Internal Revenue Service tax systems modernization. Generally, we reported that these agencies’ enterprise architectures were incomplete, and we made recommendations that they develop and implement complete enterprise architectures to guide their modernization efforts. Since then, we have reviewed enterprise architecture management at other federal agencies, including the Department of Education (Education), the Customs Service, the Immigration and Naturalization Service, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, FAA, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). We have also reviewed the use of enterprise architectures for critical agency functional areas, such as the integration and sharing of terrorist watch lists across key federal departments and DOD financial management, logistics management, combat identification, and business systems modernization. These reviews continued to identify the absence of complete and enforced enterprise architectures, which in turn has led to agency business operations, systems, and data that are duplicative, incompatible, and not integrated; these conditions have either prevented agencies from sharing data or forced them to depend on expensive, custom-developed system interfaces to do so. Accordingly, we made recommendations to improve the respective architecture efforts. In some cases progress has been made, such as at DOD and FBI. As a practical matter, however, considerable time is needed to completely address the kind of substantive issues that we have raised and to make progress in establishing more mature architecture programs. In 2002 and 2003, we also published reports on the status of enterprise architectures governmentwide. The first report (February 2002) showed that about 52 percent of federal agencies self-reported having at least the management foundation that is needed to successfully develop, implement, and maintain an enterprise architecture, and that about 48 percent of agencies had not yet advanced to that basic stage of maturity. We attributed this state of architecture management to four management challenges: (1) overcoming limited executive understanding, (2) inadequate funding, (3) insufficient number of skilled staff, and (4) organizational parochialism. Additionally, we recognized OMB’s efforts to promote and oversee agencies’ enterprise architecture efforts. Nevertheless, we determined that OMB’s leadership and oversight could be improved by, for example, using a more structured means of measuring agencies’ progress and by addressing the above management challenges. The second report (November 2003) showed the percentage of agencies that had established at least a foundation for enterprise architecture management was virtually unchanged. We attributed this to long-standing enterprise architecture challenges that had yet to be addressed. In particular, more agencies reported lack of agency executive understanding of enterprise architecture and the scarcity of skilled architecture staff as significant challenges. OMB generally agreed with our findings and the need for additional agency assessments. Further, it stated that fully implementing our recommendations would require sustained management attention, and that it had begun by working with the CIO Council to establish the Chief Architect Forum and to increase the information OMB reports on enterprise architecture to Congress. Since then, OMB has developed and implemented an enterprise architecture assessment tool. According to OMB, the tool helps better understand the current state of an agency’s architecture and assists agencies in integrating architectures into their decision-making processes. The latest version of the assessment tool (2.0) was released in December 2005 and includes three capability areas: (1) completion, (2) use, and (3) results. Table 2 describes each of these areas. The tool also includes criteria for scoring an agency’s architecture program on a scale of 0 to 5. In early 2006, the major departments and agencies were required by OMB to self assess their architecture programs using the tool. OMB then used the self assessment to develop its own assessment. These assessment results are to be used in determining the agency’s e- Government score within the President’s Management Agenda. In 2002, we developed version 1.0 of our Enterprise Architecture Management Maturity Framework (EAMMF) to provide federal agencies with a common benchmarking tool for planning and measuring their efforts to improve enterprise architecture management, as well as to provide OMB with a means for doing the same governmentwide. We issued an update of the framework (version 1.1) in 2003. This framework is an extension of A Practical Guide to Federal Enterprise Architecture, Version 1.0, published by the CIO Council. Version 1.1 of the framework arranges 31 core elements (practices or conditions that are needed for effective enterprise architecture management) into a matrix of five hierarchical maturity stages and four critical success attributes that apply to each stage. Within a given stage, each critical success attribute includes between one and four core elements. Based on the implicit dependencies among the core elements, the EAMMF associates each element with one of five maturity stages (see fig. 1). The core elements can be further categorized by four groups: architecture governance, content, use, and measurement. Stage 1: Creating EA awareness. At stage 1, either an organization does not have plans to develop and use an architecture, or it has plans that do not demonstrate an awareness of the value of having and using an architecture. While stage 1 agencies may have initiated some enterprise architecture activity, these agencies’ efforts are ad hoc and unstructured, lack institutional leadership and direction, and do not provide the management foundation necessary for successful enterprise architecture development as defined in stage 2. Stage 2: Building the EA management foundation. An organization at stage 2 recognizes that the enterprise architecture is a corporate asset by vesting accountability for it in an executive body that represents the entire enterprise. At this stage, an organization assigns enterprise architecture management roles and responsibilities and establishes plans for developing enterprise architecture products and for measuring program progress and product quality; it also commits the resources necessary for developing an architecture—people, processes, and tools. Specifically, a stage 2 organization has designated a chief architect and established and staffed a program office responsible for enterprise architecture development and maintenance. Further, it has established a committee or group that has responsibility for enterprise architecture governance (i.e., directing, overseeing, and approving architecture development and maintenance). This committee or group membership has enterprisewide representation. At stage 2, the organization either has plans for developing or has started developing at least some enterprise architecture products, and it has developed an enterprisewide awareness of the value of enterprise architecture and its intended use in managing its IT investments. The organization has also selected a framework and a methodology that will be the basis for developing the enterprise architecture products and has selected a tool for automating these activities. Stage 3: Developing the EA. An organization at stage 3 focuses on developing architecture products according to the selected framework, methodology, tool, and established management plans. Roles and responsibilities assigned in the previous stage are in place, and resources are being applied to develop actual enterprise architecture products. At this stage, the scope of the architecture has been defined to encompass the entire enterprise, whether organization-based or function-based. Although the products may not be complete, they are intended to describe the organization in terms of business, performance, information/data, service/application, and technology (including security explicitly in each) as provided for in the framework, methodology, tool, and management plans. Further, the products are to describe the current (as-is) and future (to-be) states and the plan for transitioning from the current to the future state (the sequencing plan). As the products are developed and evolve, they are subject to configuration management. Further, through the established enterprise architecture management foundation, the organization is tracking and measuring its progress against plans, identifying and addressing variances, as appropriate, and then reporting on its progress. Stage 4: Completing the EA. An organization at stage 4 has completed its enterprise architecture products, meaning that the products have been approved by the enterprise architecture steering committee (established in stage 2) or an investment review board, and by the CIO. The completed products collectively describe the enterprise in terms of business, performance, information/data, service/application, and technology for both its current and future operating states, and the products include a plan for transitioning from the current to the future state. Further, an independent agent has assessed the quality (i.e., completeness and accuracy) of the enterprise architecture products. Additionally, evolution of the approved products is governed by a written enterprise architecture maintenance policy approved by the head of the organization. Stage 5: Leveraging the EA to manage change. An organization at stage 5 has secured senior leadership approval of the enterprise architecture products and a written institutional policy stating that IT investments must comply with the architecture, unless granted an explicit compliance waiver. Further, decision makers are using the architecture to identify and address ongoing and proposed IT investments that are conflicting, overlapping, not strategically linked, or redundant. As a result, stage 5 entities avoid unwarranted overlap across investments and ensure maximum systems interoperability, which in turn ensures the selection and funding of IT investments with manageable risks and returns. Also, at stage 5, the organization tracks and measures enterprise architecture benefits or return on investment, and adjustments are continuously made to both the enterprise architecture management process and the enterprise architecture products. Attribute 1: Demonstrates commitment. Because the enterprise architecture is a corporate asset for systematically managing institutional change, the support and sponsorship of the head of the enterprise are essential to the success of the architecture effort. An approved enterprise policy statement provides such support and sponsorship, promoting institutional buy-in and encouraging resource commitment from participating components. Equally important in demonstrating commitment is vesting ownership of the architecture with an executive body that collectively owns the enterprise. Attribute 2: Provides capability to meet commitment. The success of the enterprise architecture effort depends largely on the organization’s capacity to develop, maintain, and implement the enterprise architecture. Consistent with any large IT project, these capabilities include providing adequate resources (i.e., people, processes, and technology), defining clear roles and responsibilities, and defining and implementing organizational structures and process management controls that promote accountability and effective project execution. Attribute 3: Demonstrates satisfaction of commitment. Satisfaction of the organization’s commitment to develop, maintain, and implement an enterprise architecture is demonstrated by the production of artifacts (e.g., the plans and products). Such artifacts demonstrate follow through—that is, actual enterprise architecture production. Satisfaction of commitment is further demonstrated by senior leadership approval of enterprise architecture documents and artifacts; such approval communicates institutional endorsement and ownership of the architecture and the change that it is intended to drive. Attribute 4: Verifies satisfaction of commitment. This attribute focuses on measuring and disclosing the extent to which efforts to develop, maintain, and implement the enterprise architecture have fulfilled stated goals or commitments of the enterprise architecture. Measuring such performance allows for tracking progress that has been made toward stated goals, allows appropriate actions to be taken when performance deviates significantly from goals, and creates incentives to influence both institutional and individual behaviors. The framework’s 31 core elements can also be placed in one of four groups of architecture related activities, processes, products, events, and structures. The groups are architecture governance, content, use, and measurement. These groups are generally consistent with the capability area descriptions in the previously discussed OMB enterprise architecture assessment tool. For example, OMB’s completion capability area addresses ensuring that architecture products describe the agency in terms of processes, services, data, technology, and performance and that the agency has developed a transition strategy. Similarly, our content group includes developing and completing these same enterprise architecture products. In addition, OMB’s results capability area addresses performance measurement as does our measurement group, and OMB’s use capability area addresses many of the same elements in our governance and use groups. Table 3 lists the core elements according to EAMMF group. Most of the 27 major departments and agencies have not fully satisfied all the core elements associated with stage 2 of our maturity framework. At the same time, however, most have satisfied a number of core elements at stages 3, 4, and 5. Specifically, although only seven have fully satisfied all the stage 2 elements, the 27 have on average fully satisfied 80, 78, 61, and 52 percent of the stage 2, 3, 4, and 5 elements, respectively. Of the core elements that have been fully satisfied, 77 percent of those related to architecture governance have been fully satisfied, while 68, 52, and 47 percent of those related to architecture content, use, and measurement, respectively, have been fully satisfied. Most of the 27 have also at least partially satisfied a number of additional core elements across all the stages. For example, all but 7 have at least partially satisfied all the elements required to achieve stage 3 or higher. Collectively, this means efforts are underway to mature the management of most agency enterprise architecture programs, but overall these efforts are uneven and still a work- in-progress and they face numerous challenges that departments and agencies identified. It also means that some architecture programs provide examples from which less mature programs could learn and improve. Without mature enterprise architecture programs, some departments and agencies will not realize the many benefits that they attributed to architectures, and they are at risk of investing in IT assets that are duplicative, not well-integrated, and do not optimally support mission operations. To qualify for a given stage of maturity under our architecture management framework, a department or agency had to fully satisfy all of the core elements at that stage. Using this criterion, three departments and agencies are at stage 2, meaning that they demonstrated to us through verifiable documentation that they have established the foundational commitments and capabilities needed to manage the development of an architecture. In addition, four are at stage 3, meaning that they similarly demonstrated that their architecture development efforts reflect employment of the basic control measures in our framework. Table 4 summarizes the maturity stage of each architecture program that we assessed. Appendix IV provides the detailed results of our assessment of each department and agency architecture program against our maturity framework. While using this criterion provides an important perspective on the state of department and agency architecture programs, it can mask the fact that the programs have met a number of core elements across higher stages of maturity. When the percentage of core elements that have been fully satisfied at each stage is considered, the state of the architecture efforts generally shows both a larger number of more robust architecture programs as well as more variability across the departments and agencies. Specifically, 16 departments and agencies have fully satisfied more than 70 percent of the core elements. Examples include Commerce, which has satisfied 87 percent of the core elements, including 75 percent of the stage 5 elements, even though it is at stage 1 because its enterprise architecture approval board does not have enterprisewide representation (a stage 2 core element). Similarly, SSA, which is also a stage 1 because the agency’s enterprise architecture methodology does not describe the steps for developing, maintaining, and validating the agency’s enterprise architecture (a stage 2 core element), has at the same time satisfied 87 percent of all the elements, including 63 percent of the stage 5 elements. In contrast, the Army, which is also in stage 1, has satisfied but 3 percent of all framework elements. Overall, 10 agency architecture programs fully satisfied more than 75 percent of the core elements, 14 between 50 and 75 percent, and 4 fewer than 50 percent. These four included the three military departments. Table 5 summarizes for each department and agency the percentage of core elements fully satisfied in total and by maturity stage. Notwithstanding the additional perspective that the percentage of core elements fully satisfied across all stages provides, it is important to note that the staged core elements in our framework represent a hierarchical or systematic progression to establishing a well-managed architecture program, meaning that core elements associated with lower framework stages generally support the effective execution of higher maturity stage core elements. For instance, if a program has developed its full suite of “as- is” and “to-be” architecture products, including a sequencing plan (stage 4 core elements), but the products are not under configuration management (stage 3 core element), then the integrity and consistency of the products will be not be assured. Our analysis showed that this was the case for a number of architecture programs. For example, State has developed certain “as-is” and “to-be” products for the Joint Enterprise Architecture, which is being developed in collaboration with USAID, but an enterprise architecture configuration management plan has not yet been finalized. Further, not satisfying even a single core element can have a significant impact on the effectiveness of an architecture program. For example, not having adequate human capital with the requisite knowledge and skills (stage 2 core element), not using a defined framework or methodology (stage 2 core element), or not using an independent verification and validation agent (stage 4 core element), could significantly limit the quality and utility of an architecture. The DOD’s experience between 2001 and 2005 in developing its BEA is a case in point. During this time, we identified the need for the department to have an enterprise architecture for its business operations, and we made a series of recommendations grounded in, among other things, our architecture management framework to ensure that it was successful in doing so. In 2005, we reported that the department had not implemented most of our recommendations. We further reported that despite developing multiple versions of a wide range of architecture products, and having invested hundreds of millions of dollars and 4 years in doing so, the department did not have a well-defined architecture and that what it had developed had limited utility. Among other things, we attributed the poor state of its architecture products to ineffective program governance, communications, program planning, human capital, and configuration management, most of which are stage 2 and 3 foundational core elements. To the department’s credit, we recently reported that it has since taken a number of actions to address these fundamental weaknesses and our related recommendations and that it is now producing architecture products that provide a basis upon which to build. The significance of not satisfying a single core element is also readily apparent for elements associated with the framework’s content group. In particular, the framework emphasizes the importance of planning for, developing, and completing an architecture that includes the “as-is” and the “to-be” environments as well as a plan for transitioning between the two. It also recognizes that the “as-is” and “to-be” should address the business, performance, information/data, application/service, technology, and security aspects of the enterprise. To the extent these aspects are not addressed in this way, the quality of the architecture and thus its utility will suffer. In this regard, we found examples of departments and agencies that were addressing some but not all of these aspects. For example, HUD has yet to adequately incorporate security into its architecture. This is significant because security is relevant to all the other aspects of its architecture, such as information/data and applications/services. As another example, NASA’s architecture does not include a plan for transitioning from the “as-is” to the “to-be” environments. According to the administration’s Chief Enterprise Architect, a transition plan has not yet been developed because of insufficient time and staff. Looking across all the departments and agencies at core elements that are fully satisfied, not by stage of maturity, but by related groupings of core elements, provides an additional perspective on the state of the federal government’s architecture efforts. As noted earlier, these groupings of core elements are architecture governance, content, use, and measurement. Overall, departments and agencies on average have fully satisfied 77 percent of the governance-related elements. In particular, 93 and 96 percent of the agencies have established an architecture program office and appointed a chief architect, respectively. In addition, 93 percent have plans that call for their respective architectures to describe the “as-is” and the “to-be” environments, and for having a plan for transitioning between the two (see fig. 2). In contrast, however, the core element associated with having a committee or group with representation from across the enterprise directing, overseeing, and approving the architecture was fully satisfied by only 57 percent of the agencies. This core element is important because the architecture is a corporate asset that needs to be enterprisewide in scope and accepted by senior leadership if it is to be leveraged for organizational change. In contrast to governance, the extent of full satisfaction of those core elements that are associated with what an architecture should contain varies widely (see fig. 3). For example, the three content elements that address prospectively what the architecture will contain, either in relation to plans or some provision for including needed content, were fully satisfied about 90 percent of the time. However, the core elements addressing whether the products now contain such content were fully satisfied much less frequently (between 54 and 68 percent of the time, depending on the core element), and the core elements associated with ensuring the quality of included content, such as employing configuration management and undergoing independent verification and validation, were also fully satisfied much less frequently (54 and 21 percent of the time, respectively). The state of these core elements raises important questions about the quality and utility of the department and agency architectures. The degree of full satisfaction of those core elements associated with the remaining two groups—use and measurement—is even lower (see figs. 4 and 5, respectively). For example, the architecture use-related core elements were fully satisfied between 39 and 64 percent of the time, while the measurement-related elements were satisfied between 14 and 71 percent. Of particular note is that only 39 percent of the departments and agencies could demonstrate that IT investments comply with their enterprise architectures, only 43 percent of the departments and agencies could demonstrate that compliance with the enterprise architecture is measured and reported, and only 14 percent were measuring and reporting on their respective architecture program’s return on investment. As our work and related best practices show, the value in having an architecture is using it to affect change and produce results. Such results, as reported by the departments and agencies include improved information sharing, increased consolidation, enhanced productivity, and lower costs, all of which contribute to improved agency performance. To realize these benefits, however, IT investments need to comply with the architecture and measurement of architecture activities, including accrual of expected benefits, needs to occur. In those instances where departments and agencies have not fully satisfied certain core elements in our framework, most have at least partially satisfied these elements. To illustrate, 4 agencies would improve to at least stage 4 if the criterion for being a given stage was relaxed to only partially satisfying a core element. Moreover, 11 of the remaining agencies would advance by two stages under such a less demanding criterion, and only 6 would not improve their stage of maturity under these circumstances. A case in point is Commerce, which could move from stage 1 to stage 5 under these circumstances because it has fully satisfied all but four core elements and these remaining four (one each at stages 2 and 4 and two at stage 5) are partially satisfied. Another case in point is the SSA, which has fully satisfied all but four core elements (one at stage 2 and three at stage 5) and has partially satisfied three of these remaining four. If the criterion used allowed advancement to the next stage by only partially satisfying core elements, the administration would be stage 4. (See fig. 6 for a comparison of department and agency program maturity stages under the two criteria.) As mentioned earlier, departments and agencies can require considerable time to completely address issues related to their respective enterprise architecture programs. It is thus important to note that even though certain core elements are partially satisfied, fully satisfying some of them may not be accomplished quickly and easily. It is also important to note the importance of fully, rather than partially, satisfying certain elements, such as those that fall within the architecture content group. In this regard, 18, 18, and 21 percent of the departments and agencies partially satisfied the following stage 4 content-related core elements, respectively: “EA products describe ‘as-is’ environment, ‘to-be’ environment and sequencing plan”; “Both ‘as-is’ and ‘to-be’ environments are described in terms of business, performance, information/data, application/service, and technology”; and “These descriptions fully address security.” Not fully satisfying these elements can have important implications for the quality of an architecture, and thus its usability and results. Seven departments or agencies would meet our criterion for stage 5 if each was to fully satisfy one to five additional core elements (see table 6). For example, Interior could achieve stage 5 by satisfying one additional element: “EA products and management processes undergo independent verification and validation.” In this regard, Interior officials have drafted a statement of work intended to ensure that independent verification and validation of enterprise architecture products and management processes is performed. The other six departments and agencies are HUD and OPM, which could achieve stage 5 by satisfying two additional elements; Commerce, Labor, and SSA, which could achieve the same by satisfying four additional elements; and Education which could be at stage 5 by satisfying five additional elements. Of these seven, five have not fully satisfied the independent verification and validation core element. Notwithstanding the fact that five or fewer core elements need to be satisfied by these agencies to be at stage 5, it is important to note that in some cases the core elements not being satisfied are not only very important, but also neither quickly nor easily satisfied. For example, one of the two elements that HUD needs to satisfy is having its architecture products address security. This is extremely important as security is an integral aspect of the architecture’s performance, business, information/data, application/service, and technical models, and needs to be reflected thoroughly and consistently across each of them. The challenges facing departments and agencies in developing and using enterprise architectures are formidable. The challenge that most departments and agencies cited as being experienced to the greatest extent is the one that having and using an architecture is intended to overcome— organizational parochialism and cultural resistance to adopting an enterprisewide mode of operation in which organizational parts are sub- optimized in order to optimize the performance and results of the enterprise as a whole. Specifically, 93 percent of the departments and agencies reported that they encountered this challenge to a significant (very great or great) or moderate extent. Other challenges reported to this same extent were ensuring that the architecture program had adequate funding (89 percent), obtaining staff skilled in the architecture discipline (86 percent), and having the department or agency senior leaders understand the importance and role of the enterprise architecture (82 percent). As we have previously reported, sustained top management leadership is the key to overcoming each of these challenges. In this regard, our enterprise architecture management maturity framework provides for such leadership and addressing these and other challenges through a number of core elements. These elements contain mechanisms aimed at, for example, establishing responsibility and accountability for the architecture with senior leaders and ensuring that the necessary institutional commitments are made to the architecture program, such as through issuance of architecture policy and provision of adequate resources (both funding and people). See table 7 for a listing of the reported challenges and the extent to which they are being experienced. A large percentage of the departments and agencies reported that they have already accrued numerous benefits from their respective architecture programs (see table 8). For example, 70 percent said that have already improved the alignment between their business operations and the IT that supports these operations to a significant extent. Such alignment is extremely important. According to our IT investment management maturity framework, alignment between business needs and IT investments is a critical process in building the foundation for an effective approach to IT investment management. In addition, 64 percent responded that they have also improved information/knowledge sharing to a significant or moderate extent. Such sharing is also very important. In 2005, for example, we added homeland security information sharing to our list of high-risk areas because despite the importance of information to fighting terrorism and maintaining the security of our nation, many aspects of homeland security information sharing remain ineffective and fragmented. Other examples of mission-effectiveness related benefits reported as already being achieved to a significant or moderate extent by roughly one-half of the departments and agencies included improved agency management and change management and improved system and application interoperability. Beyond these benefits, departments and agencies also reported already accruing, to a significant or moderate extent, a number of efficiency and productivity benefits. For example, 56 percent reported that they have increased the use of enterprise software licenses, which can permit cost savings through economies of scale purchases; 56 percent report that they have been able to consolidate their IT infrastructure environments, which can reduce the costs of operating and maintaining duplicative capabilities; 41 percent reported that they have been able to reduce the number of applications, which is a key to reducing expensive maintenance costs; and 37 percent report productivity improvements, which can free resources to focus on other high priority matters. Notwithstanding the number and extent of benefits that department and agency responses show have already been realized, these same responses also show even more benefits that they have yet to realize (see table 8). For example, 30 percent reported that they have thus far achieved, to little or no extent, better business and IT alignment. They similarly reported that they have largely untapped many other effectiveness and efficiency benefits, with between 36 and 70 percent saying these benefits have been achieved to little or no extent, depending on benefit. Moreover, for all the cited benefits, a far greater percentage of the departments and agencies (74 to 93 percent) reported that they expect to realize each of the benefits to a significant or moderate extent sometime in the future. What this suggests is that the real value in the federal government from developing and using enterprise architecture remains largely unrealized potential. Our architecture maturity framework recognizes that a key to realizing this potential is effectively managing department and agency enterprise architecture programs. However, knowing whether benefits and results are in fact being achieved requires having associated measures and metrics. In this regard, very few (21 percent) of the departments and agencies fully satisfied our stage 5 core element, “Return on EA investment is measured and reported.” Without satisfying this element, it is unlikely that the degree to which expected benefits are accrued will be known. If managed effectively, enterprise architectures can be a useful change management and organizational transformation tool. The conditions for effectively managing enterprise architecture programs are contained in our architecture management maturity framework. While a few of the federal government’s 27 major departments and agencies have fully satisfied all the conditions needed to be at stage 2 or above in our framework, many have fully satisfied a large percentage of the core elements across most of the stages, particularly those elements related to architecture governance. Nevertheless, most departments and agencies are not yet where they need to be relative to architecture content, use, and measurement and thus the federal government is not as well positioned as it should be to realize the significant benefits that a well-managed architecture program can provide. Moving beyond this status will require most departments and agencies to overcome some significant obstacles and challenges. The key to doing so continues to be sustained organizational leadership. Without such organizational leadership, the benefits of enterprise architecture will not be fully realized. To assist the 27 major departments and agencies in addressing enterprise architecture challenges, managing their architecture programs, and realizing architecture benefits, we recommend that the Administrators of the Environmental Protection Agency, General Services Administration, National Aeronautics and Space Administration, Small Business Administration, and U.S. Agency for International Development; the Attorney General; the Commissioners of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and Social Security Administration; the Directors of the National Science Foundation and the Office of Personnel Management; and the Secretaries of the Departments of Agriculture, Commerce, Defense, Education, Energy, Health and Human Services, Homeland Security, Housing and Urban Development, Interior, Labor, State, Transportation, Treasury, and Veterans Affairs ensure that their respective enterprise architecture programs develop and implement plans for fully satisfying each of the conditions in our enterprise architecture management maturity framework. We received written or oral comments on a draft of this report from 25 of the departments and agencies in our review. Of the 25 departments and agencies, all but one department fully agreed with our recommendation. Nineteen departments and agencies agreed and six partially agreed with our findings. Areas of disagreement for these six centered on (1) the adequacy of the documentation that they provided to demonstrate satisfaction of certain core elements and (2) recognition of steps that they reported taking to satisfy certain core elements after we concluded our review. For the most part, these isolated areas of disagreement did not result in any changes to our findings for two primary reasons. First, our findings across the departments and agencies were based on consistently applied evaluation criteria governing the adequacy of documentation, and were not adjusted to accommodate any one particular department or agency. Second, our findings represent the state of each architecture program as of March 2006, and thus to be consistent do not reflect activities that may have occurred after this time. Beyond these comments, several agencies offered suggestions for improving our framework, which we will consider prior to issuing the next version of the framework. The departments’ and agencies’ respective comments and our responses, as warranted, are as follows: Agriculture’s Associate CIO provided e-mail comments stating that the department will incorporate our recommendation into its enterprise architecture program plan. Commerce’s CIO stated in written comments that the department concurred with our findings and will consider actions to address our recommendation. Commerce’s written comments are reproduced in appendix V. DOD’s Director, Architecture and Interoperability, stated in written comments that the department generally concurred with our recommendation to the five DOD architecture programs included in our review. However, the department stated that it did not concur with the one aspect of the recommendation directed at the GIG architecture concerning independent verification and validation (IV&V) because it believes that its current internal verification and validation activities are sufficient. We do not agree for two reasons. First, these internal processes are not independently performed. As we have previously reported, IV&V is a recognized hallmark of well managed programs, including architecture programs, and to be effective, it must be performed by an entity that is independent of the processes and products that are being reviewed. Second, the scope of the internal verification and validation activities only extends to a subset of the architecture products and management processes. The department also stated that it did not concur with one aspect of our finding directed at BEA addressing security. According to DOD, because GIG addresses security and the GIG states that it extends to all defense mission areas, including the business mission area, the BEA in effect addresses security. We do not fully agree. While we acknowledge that GIG addresses security and states that it is to extend to all DOD mission areas, including the business mission area, it does not describe how this will be accomplished for BEA. Moreover, nowhere in the BEA is security addressed, either through statement or reference, relative to the architecture’s performance, business, information/data, application/service, and technology products. DOD’s written comments, along with our responses, are reproduced in appendix VI. Education’s Assistant Secretary for Management and Acting CIO stated in written comments that the department plans to address our findings. Education’s written comments are reproduced in appendix VII. Energy’s Acting Associate CIO for Information Technology Reform stated in written comments that the department concurs with our report. Energy’s written comments are reproduced in appendix VIII. DHS’s Director, Departmental GAO/OIG Liaison Office, stated in written comments that the department has taken, and plans to take, steps to address our recommendation. DHS’s written comments, along with our responses to its suggestions for improving our framework, are reproduced in appendix IX. DHS also provided technical comments via e-mail, which we have incorporated, as appropriate, in the report. HUD’s CIO stated in written comments that the department generally concurs with our findings and is developing a plan to address our recommendation. The CIO also provided updated information about activities that the department is taking to address security in its architecture. HUD’s written comments are reproduced in appendix X. Interior’s Assistant Secretary, Policy, Management and Budget, stated in written comments that the department agrees with our findings and recommendation and that it has recently taken action to address them. Interior’s written comments are reproduced in appendix XI. DOJ’s CIO stated in written comments that our findings accurately reflect the state of the department’s enterprise architecture program and the areas that it needs to address. The CIO added that our report will help guide the department’s architecture program and provided suggestions for improving our framework and its application. DOJ’s written comments, along with our responses to its suggestions, are reproduced in appendix XII. Labor’s Deputy CIO provided e-mail comments stating that the department concurs with our findings. The Deputy CIO also provided technical comments that we have incorporated, as appropriate, in the report. State’s Assistant Secretary for Resource Management and Chief Financial Officer provided written comments that summarize actions that the department will take to fully satisfy certain core elements and that suggest some degree of disagreement with our findings relative to three other core elements. First, the department stated that its architecture configuration management plan has been approved by both the State and USAID CIOs. However, it provided no evidence to demonstrate that this was the case as of March 2006 when we concluded our review, and thus we did not change our finding relative to architecture products being under configuration management. Second, the department stated that its enterprise architecture has been approved by State and USAID executive offices. However, it did not provide any documentation showing such approval. Moreover, it did not identify which executive offices it was referring to so as to allow a determination of whether they were collectively representative of the enterprise. As a result, we did not change our finding relative to whether a committee or group representing the enterprise or an investment review board has approved the current version of the architecture. Third, the department stated that it provided us with IT investment score sheets during our review that demonstrate that investment compliance with the architecture is measured and reported. However, no such score sheets were provided to us. Therefore, we did not change our finding. The department’s written comments, along with more detailed responses, are reproduced in appendix XIII. Treasury’s Associate CIO for E-Government stated in written comments that the department concurs with our findings and discussed steps being taken to mature its enterprise architecture program. The Associate CIO also stated that our findings confirm the department’s need to provide executive leadership in developing its architecture program and to codify the program into department policy. Treasury’s written comments are reproduced in appendix XIV. VA’s Deputy Secretary stated in written comments that the department concurred with our recommendation and that it will provide a detailed plan to implement our recommendation. VA’s written comments are reproduced in appendix XV. EPA’s Acting Assistant Administrator and CIO stated in written comments that the agency generally agreed with our findings and that our assessment is a valuable benchmarking exercise that will help improve agency performance. The agency also provided comments on our findings relative to five core elements. For one of these core elements, the comments directed us to information previously provided about the agency’s architecture committee that corrected our understanding and resulted in us changing our finding about this core element. With respect to the other four core elements concerning use of an architecture methodology, measurement of progress against program plans, integration of the architecture into investment decision making, and management of architecture change, the comments also directed us to information previously provided but this did not result in any changes to our findings because evidence demonstrating full satisfaction of each core element was not apparent. EPA’s written comments, along with more detailed responses to each, are reproduced in appendix XVI. GSA’s Administrator stated in written comments that the agency concurs with our recommendation. The Administrator added that our findings will be critical as the agency works towards further implementing our framework’s core elements. GSA’s written comments are reproduced in appendix XVII. NASA’s Deputy Administrator stated in written comments that the agency concurs with our recommendation. NASA’s written comments are reproduced in appendix XVIII. NASA’s GAO Liaison also provided technical comments via e-mail, which we have incorporated, as appropriate, in the report. NSF’s CIO provided e-mail comments stating that the agency will use the information in our report, where applicable, for future planning and investment in its architecture program. The CIO also provided technical comments that we have incorporated, as appropriate, in the report. NRC’s GAO liaison provided e-mail comments stating that the agency substantially agrees with our findings and describing activities it has recently taken to address them. OPM’s CIO provided e-mail comments stating that the agency agrees with our findings and describing actions it is taking to address them. SBA’s GAO liaison provided e-mail comments in which the agency disagreed with our findings on two core elements. First, and notwithstanding agency officials’ statements that its architecture program did not have adequate resources, the liaison did not agree with our “partially satisfied” assessment for this core element because, according to the liaison, the agency has limited discretionary funds and competing, but unfunded, federal mandates to comply with that limit discretionary funding for an agency of its size. While we acknowledge SBA’s challenges, we would note that they are not unlike the resource constraints and competing priority decisions that face most agencies, and that while the reasons why an architecture program may not be adequately resourced may be justified, the fact remains that any assessment of the architecture program’s maturity, and thus its likelihood of success, needs to recognize whether adequate resources exist. Therefore, we did not change our finding on this core element. Second, the liaison did not agree with our finding that the agency did not have plans for developing metrics for measuring architecture progress, quality, compliance, and return on investment. However, our review of documentation provided by SBA and cited by the liaison showed that while such plans address metric development for architecture progress, quality, and compliance, they do not address architecture return on investment. Therefore, we did not change our finding that this core element was partially satisfied. SSA’s Commissioner stated in written comments that the report is both informative and useful, and that the agency agrees with our recommendation and generally agrees with our findings. Nevertheless, the agency disagreed with our findings on two core elements. First, the agency stated that documentation provided to us showed that it has a methodology for developing, maintaining, and validating its architecture. We do not agree. In particular, our review of SSA provided documentation showed that it did not adequately describe the steps to be followed relative to development, maintenance, or validation. Second, the agency stated that having the head of the agency approve the current version of the architecture is satisfied in SSA’s case because the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996 vests its CIO with enterprise architecture approval authority and the CIO has approved the architecture. We do not agree. The core element in our framework concerning enterprise architecture approval by the agency head is derived from federal guidance and best practices upon which our framework is based. This guidance and related practices, and thus our framework, recognize that an enterprise architecture is a corporate asset that is to be owned and implemented by senior management across the enterprise, and that a key characteristic of a mature architecture program is having the architecture approved by the department or agency head. Because the Clinger-Cohen Act does not address approval of an enterprise architecture, our framework’s core element for agency head approval of an enterprise architecture is not inconsistent with, and is not superseded by, that act. SSA’s written comments, along with more detailed responses, are reproduced in appendix XIX. USAID’s Acting Chief Financial Officer stated in written comments stated that the agency will work with State to implement our recommendation. USAID’s written comments are reproduced in appendix XX. As agreed with your offices, unless you publicly announce the contents of this report earlier, we plan no further distribution until 30 days from the report date. At that time, we will send copies of this report to the Administrators of the Environmental Protection Agency, General Services Administration, National Aeronautics and Space Administration, Small Business Administration, and U.S. Agency for International Development; the Attorney General; the Commissioners of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and Social Security Administration; the Directors of the National Science Foundation and the Office of Personnel Management; and the Secretaries of the Departments of Agriculture, Commerce, Defense, Education, Energy, Health and Human Services, Homeland Security, Housing and Urban Development, Interior, Labor, State, Transportation, Treasury, and Veterans Affairs. We will also make copies available to others upon request. In addition, the report will be available at no charge on the GAO Web site at http://www.gao.gov.

Department- and agency-reported data show wide variability in their costs to develop and maintain their enterprise architectures. Generally, the costs could be allocated to several categories with the majority of costs attributable to contractor support and agency personnel. As we have previously reported, the depth and detail of the architecture to be developed and maintained is dictated by the scope and nature of the enterprise and the extent of enterprise transformation and modernization envisioned. Therefore, the architecture should be tailored to the individual enterprise and that enterprise’s intended use of the architecture. Accordingly, the level of resources that a given department or agency invests in its architecture is likely to vary. Departments and agencies reported that they have collectively invested a total of $836 million to date on enterprise architecture development. Across the 27 departments and agencies, these development costs ranged from a low of $2 million by the Department of the Navy to a high of $433 million by the Department of Defense (DOD) on its Business Enterprise Architecture (BEA). Department and agency estimates of the costs to complete their planned architecture development efforts collectively total about $328 million. The department and agencies combined estimates of annual architecture maintenance costs is about $146 million. These development and maintenance estimates, however, do not include the Departments of the Army and Justice because neither provided these cost estimates. Figures 7 through 9 depict the variability of cost data reported by the departments and agencies. All of the departments and agencies reported developing their architecture in-house using contractor support. All but two of the departments and agencies allocated their respective architecture development costs to the following cost categories: contractor support, agency personnel, tools, methodologies, training, and other. These 26 agencies accounted for about $741 million of the $836 million total development costs cited above. The vast majority (84 percent) of the $741 million were allocated to contractor services ($621 million), followed next by agency personnel (13 percent or $94 million). The remaining $26 million were allocated as follows: $12 million (2 percent) to architecture tools; $9 million (1 percent) to “other” costs; $4 million (1 percent) to architecture methodologies; and $2 million (less than 1 percent) to training. (See fig. 10.) The departments and agencies allocated the reported $621 million in contractor-related costs to the following five contractor cost categories: architecture development, independent verification and validation, methodology, support services, and other. Of these categories, architecture development activities accounted for the majority of costs— about $594 million (87 percent). The remaining $85 million was allocated as follows: $51 million (7 percent) to support services, $13 million (2 percent) to “other” costs, $11 million (2 percent) to independent verification and validation, and $10 million (1 percent) to methodologies. (See fig. 11.) Departments and agencies reported additional information related to the implementation of their enterprise architectures. This information includes architecture tools and frameworks. As stated in our enterprise architecture management maturity framework, an automated architecture tool serves as the repository of architecture artifacts, which are the work products that are produced and used to capture and convey architectural information. An agency’s choice of tool should be based on a number of considerations, including agency needs and the size and complexity of the architecture. The departments and agencies reported that they use various automated tools to develop and maintain their enterprise architectures, with 12 reporting that they use more than one tool. In descending order of frequency, the architecture tools identified were System Architect (18 instances), Microsoft Visio (17), Metis (12), Rational Rose (8), and Enterprise Architecture Management System (EAMS) (4). In addition, 21 departments and agencies reported using one or more other architecture tools. Figure 12 shows the number of departments and agencies using each architecture tool, including the other tools. The departments and agencies also reported various levels of satisfaction with the different enterprise architecture tools. Specifically, about 75 percent of those using Microsoft Visio were either very or somewhat satisfied with the tool, as compared to about 67 percent of those using Metis, about 63 percent of those using Rational Rose, about 59 percent of those using System Architect, and 25 percent of those using EAMS. This means that the percentage of departments and agencies that were dissatisfied, either somewhat or very, with their respective tools ranged from a high of 75 percent of those using EAMS, to a low of about 6 percent of those using System Architect. No departments or agencies that used Metis, Rational Rose, or Microsoft Visio reported any dissatisfaction. See table 9 for a summary of department and agency reported satisfaction with their respective tools. As we have previously stated, an enterprise architecture framework provides a formal structure for representing the architecture’s content and serves as the basis for the specific architecture products and artifacts that the department or agency develops and maintains. As such, a framework helps ensure the consistent representation of information from across the organization and supports orderly capture and maintenance of architecture content. The departments and agencies reported using various frameworks to develop and maintain their enterprise architectures. The most frequently cited frameworks were the Federal Enterprise Architecture Program Management Office (FEAPMO) Reference Models (25 departments and agencies), the Federal Enterprise Architecture Framework (FEAF) (19 departments and agencies), and the Zachman Framework (17 departments and agencies), with 24 reporting using more than one framework. Other, less frequently reported frameworks were the Department of Defense Architecture Framework (DODAF), the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) framework, and The Open Group Architecture Framework (TOGAF). See figure 13 for a summary of the number of departments and agencies that reported using each framework. Departments and agencies also reported varying levels of satisfaction with their respective architecture. Specifically, about 72 percent of those using the FEAF indicated that they were either very or somewhat satisfied, and about 67 and 61 percent of those using the Zachman framework and the FEAPMO reference models, respectively, reported that they were similarly satisfied. As table 10 shows, few of the agencies that responded to our survey reported being dissatisfied with any of the frameworks. Our objective was to determine the current status of federal department and agency enterprise architecture efforts. To accomplish this objective, we focused on 28 enterprise architecture programs relating to 27 major departments and agencies. These 27 included the 24 departments and agencies included in the Chief Financial Officers Act. In addition, we included the three military services (the Departments of the Army, Air Force, and Navy) at the request of Department of Defense (DOD) officials. For the DOD, we also included both of its departmentwide enterprise architecture programs—the Global Information Grid and the Business Enterprise Architecture. The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), which is developing a USAID enterprise architecture and working with the Department of State (State) to develop a Joint Enterprise Architecture, asked that we evaluate its efforts to develop the USAID enterprise architecture. State officials asked that we evaluate their agency’s enterprise architecture effort based the Joint Enterprise Architecture being developed with USAID. We honored both of these requests. Table 11 lists the 28 department and agency enterprise architecture programs that formed the scope of our review. To determine the status of each of these architecture programs, we developed a data collection instrument based on our Enterprise Architecture Management Maturity Framework (EAMMF), and related guidance, such as OMB Circular A-130 and guidance published by the federal Chief Information Officers (CIO) Council, and our past reports and guidance on the management and content of enterprise architectures. We pretested this instrument at one department and one agency. Based on the results of the pretest, we modified our instrument as appropriate to ensure that our areas of inquiry were complete and clear. Next, we identified the Chief Architect or comparable official at each of the 27 departments and agencies, and met with them to discuss our scope and methodology, share our data collection instrument, and discuss the type and nature of supporting documentation needed to verify responses to our instrument questions. On the basis of department and agency provided documentation to support their respective responses to our data collection instrument, we analyzed the extent to which each satisfied the 31 core elements in our architecture maturity framework. To guide our analysis, we defined detailed evaluation criteria for determining whether a given core element was fully satisfied, partially satisfied, or not satisfied. The criteria for the stage 2, 3, 4, and 5 core elements are contained in tables 12, 13, 14, and 15 respectively. To fully satisfy a core element, sufficient documentation had to be provided to permit us to verify that all aspects of the core element were met. To partially satisfy a core element, sufficient documentation had to be provided to permit us to verify that at least some aspects of the core element were met. Core elements that were neither fully nor partially satisfied were judged to be not satisfied. Our evaluation included first analyzing the extent to which each department and agency satisfied the core elements in our framework, and then meeting with department and agency representatives to discuss core elements that were not fully satisfied and why. As part of this interaction, we sought, and in some cases were provided, additional supporting documentation. We then considered this documentation in arriving at our final determinations about the degree to which each department and agency satisfied each core element in our framework. In applying our evaluation criteria, we analyzed the results of our analysis across different core elements to determine patterns and issues. Our analysis made use of computer programs that were developed by an experienced staff; these programs were independently verified. Through our data collection instrument, we also solicited from each department and agency information on enterprise architecture challenges and benefits, including the extent to which they had been or were expected to be experienced. In addition, we solicited information on architecture costs, including costs to date and estimated costs to complete and maintain each architecture. We also solicited other information, such as use of and satisfaction with architecture tools and frameworks. We analyzed these additional data to determine relevant patterns. We did not independently verify these data. The results presented in this report reflect the state of department and agency architecture programs as of March 8, 2006. We conducted our work in the Washington, D.C., metropolitan area, from May 2005 to June 2006, in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.

We do not agree for two reasons. First, DOD’s internal processes for reviewing and validating the Global Information Grid (GIG), while important and valuable to ensuring architecture quality, are not independently performed. As we have previously reported, independent verification and validation is a recognized hallmark of well-managed programs, including architecture programs. To be effective, it should be performed by an entity that is independent of the processes and products that are being reviewed to help ensure that it is done in an unbiased manner and that is based on objective evidence. Second, the scope of these internal review and validation efforts only extends to a subset of GIG products and management processes. According to our framework, independent verification and validation should address both the architecture products and the processes used to develop them. 2. While we acknowledge that GIG program plans provide for addressing security, and our findings relative to the GIG reflect this, this is not the case for DOD’s Business Enterprise Architecture (BEA). More specifically, how security will be addressed in the BEA performance, business, information/data, application/service, and technology products is not addressed in the BEA either by explicit statement or reference. This finding relative to the BEA is consistent with our recent report on DOD’s Business System Modernization. 1. We acknowledge this recommendation and offer three comments in response. First, we have taken a number of steps over the last 5 years to coordinate our framework with OMB. For example, in 2002, we based version 1.0 of our framework on the OMB-sponsored CIO Council Practical Guide to Federal Enterprise Architecture, and we obtained concurrence on the framework from the practical guide’s principal authors. Further, we provided a draft of this version to OMB for comment, and in our 2002 report in which we assessed federal departments and agencies against this version, we recommended that OMB use the framework to guide and assess agency architecture efforts. In addition, in developing the second version of our framework in 2003, we solicited comments from OMB as well as federal departments and agencies. We also reiterated our recommendation to OMB to use the framework in our 2003 report in which we assessed federal departments and agencies against the second version of the framework. Second, we have discussed alignment of our framework and OMB’s architecture assessment tool with OMB officials. For example, after OMB developed the first version of its architecture assessment tool in 2004, we met with OMB officials to discuss our respective tools and periodic agency assessments. We also discussed OMB’s plans for issuing the next version of its assessment tool and how this next version would align with our framework. At that time, we advocated the development of comprehensive federal standards governing all aspects of architecture development, maintenance, and use. In our view, neither our framework nor OMB’s assessment tool provide such comprehensive standards, and in the case of our framework, it is not intended to provide such standards. Nevertheless, we plan to continue to evolve, refine, and improve our framework, and will be issuing an updated version that incorporates lessons learned from the results of this review. In doing so, we will continue to solicit comments from federal departments and agencies, including OMB. Third, we believe that while our framework and OMB’s assessment tool are not identical, they nevertheless consist of a common cadre of best practices and characteristics, as well as other relevant criteria that, taken together, are complementary and provide greater direction to, and visibility into, agency architecture programs than either does alone. 1. See DHS comment 1 in appendix IX. Also, while we do not have a basis for commenting on the content of the department’s OMB evaluation submission package because we did not receive it, we would note that the information that we solicit to evaluate a department or agency against our framework includes only information that should be readily available as part of any well-managed architecture program. 2. We understand the principles of federated and segmented architectures, but would emphasize that our framework is intentionally neutral with respect to these and other architecture approaches (e.g., service-oriented). That is, the scope of the framework, by design, does not extend to defining how various architecture approaches should specifically be pursued, although we recognize that supplemental guidance on this approach would be useful. Our framework was created to organize fundamental (core) architecture management practices and characteristics (elements) into a logical progression. As such, it was intended to fill an architecture management void that existed in 2001 and thereby provide the context for more detailed standards and guidance in a variety of areas. It was not intended to be the single source of all relevant architecture guidance. 3. We agree, and believe that this report, by clearly identifying those departments and agencies that have fully satisfied each core element, serves as the only readily available reference tool of which we are aware for gaining such best practice insights. 1. We acknowledge the comment that both CIOs approved the configuration management plan. However, the department did not provide us with any documentation to support this statement. 2. We acknowledge the comment that the architecture has been approved by State and USAID executive offices. However, the department did not provide any documentation describing to which executive offices the department is referring to allow a determination of whether they were collectively representative of the enterprise. Moreover, as we state in the report, the chief architect told us that a body representative of the enterprise has not approved the current version of the architecture, and according to documentation provided, the Joint Management Council is to be responsible for approving the architecture. 3. We acknowledge that steps have been taken and are planned to treat the enterprise architecture as an integral part of the investment management process, as our report findings reflect. However, our point with respect to this core element is whether the department’s investment portfolio compliance with the architecture is being measured and reported to senior leadership. In this regard, State did not provide the score sheets referred to in its comments, nor did it provide any other evidence that such reporting is occurring. 1. We agree and have modified our report to recognize evidence contained in the documents. 2. We do not agree. The 2002 documents do not contain steps for architecture maintenance. Further, evidence was not provided demonstrating that the recently prepared methodology documents were approved prior to the completion of our evaluation. 3. We do not agree. While we do not question whether EPA’s EA Transition Strategy and Sequencing Plan illustrates how annual progress in achieving the target architectural environment is measured and reported, this is not the focus of this core element. Rather, this core element addresses whether progress against the architecture program management plan is tracked and reported. While we acknowledge EPA’s comment that it tracks and reports such progress against plans on a monthly basis, neither a program plan nor reports of progress against this plan were provided as documentary evidence to support this statement. 4. We do not agree. First, while EPA’s IT investment management process provides for consideration of the enterprise architecture in investment selection and control activities, no evidence was provided demonstrating that the process has been implemented. Second, while EPA provided a description of its architecture change management process, no evidence was provided that this process has been approved and implemented. 1. We do not agree. Neither the governance committee charter nor the configuration management plan explicitly describe a methodology that includes detailed steps to be followed for developing, maintaining, and validating the architecture. Rather, these documents describe, for example, the responsibilities of the architecture governance committee and architecture configuration management procedures. 2. We do not agree. The core element in our framework concerning enterprise architecture approval by the agency head is derived from federal guidance and best practices upon which our framework is based. This guidance and related practices, and thus our framework, recognize that an enterprise architecture is a corporate asset that is to be owned and implemented by senior management across the enterprise, and that a key characteristic of a mature architecture program is having the architecture approved by the department or agency head. Because the Clinger-Cohen Act does not address approval of an enterprise architecture, our framework’s core element for agency head approval of an enterprise architecture is not inconsistent with, and is not superseded by, that act.

GAO's experience has shown that attempting to modernize and evolve IT environments without an architecture to guide and constrain investments results in operations and systems that are duplicative, not well integrated, costly to maintain, and ineffective in supporting mission goals. In light of the importance of enterprise architectures, GAO developed a five stage architecture management maturity framework that defines what needs to be done to effectively manage an architecture program. Under GAO's framework, a fully mature architecture program is one that satisfies all elements of all stages of the framework. As agreed, GAO's objective was to determine the status of major federal department and agency enterprise architecture efforts. The state of the enterprise architecture programs at the 27 major federal departments and agencies is mixed, with several having very immature programs, several having more mature programs, and most being somewhere in between. Collectively, the majority of these architecture efforts can be viewed as a work-in-progress with much remaining to be accomplished before the federal government as a whole fully realizes their transformational value. More specifically, seven architecture programs have advanced beyond the initial stage of the GAO framework, meaning that they have fully satisfied all core elements associated with the framework's second stage (establishing the management foundation for developing, using, and maintaining the architecture). Of these seven, three have also fully satisfied all the core elements associated with the third stage (developing the architecture). None have fully satisfied all of the core elements associated with the fourth (completing the architecture) and fifth (leveraging the architecture for organizational change) stages. Nevertheless, most have fully satisfied a number of the core elements across the stages higher than the stage in which they have met all core elements, with all 27 collectively satisfying about 80, 78, 61, and 52 percent of the stage two through five core elements, respectively. Further, most have partially satisfied additional elements across all the stages, and seven need to fully satisfy five or fewer elements to achieve the fifth stage. The key to these departments and agencies building upon their current status, and ultimately realizing the benefits that they cited architectures providing, is sustained executive leadership, as virtually all the challenges that they reported can be addressed by such leadership. Examples of the challenges are organizational parochialism and cultural resistance, adequate resources (human capital and funding), and top management understanding; examples of benefits cited are better information sharing, consolidation, improved productivity, and reduced costs.",govreport
"China's economy is heavily dependent on global trade and investment flows. In 2007, China overtook the United States to become the world's second-largest merchandise exporter after the European Union (EU). China's net exports (exports minus imports) contributed to one-third of its GDP growth in 2007. China's exports of goods and services as a share of GDP rose from 9.1% in 1985 to 37.8% in 2008 (see Figure 1 ). The Chinese government estimates that the foreign trade sector employs more than 80 million people, of which 28 million work in foreign-invested enterprises. Foreign direct investment (FDI) flows to China have been a major factor behind its productivity gains and rapid economic growth. FDI flows to China in 2007 totaled $75 billion, making it the largest FDI recipient among developing countries and the third largest overall, after the EU and the United States; FDI flows to China in 2008 were $92 billion. The current global economic slowdown (especially among its major export markets—the United States, the EU, and Japan) is having a significant negative impact on China's export sector and industries that depend on FDI flows. The Chinese economy slowed sharply in 2008 and early 2009. China's fourth-quarter 2008 real GDP growth (year-on-year basis) was 6.8%, and its 1 st quarter 2009 growth (year-on-year basis) was 6.1% (reportedly, the slowest quarterly growth in 10 years). Some analysts contend annual economic growth of less than 8% could lead to social unrest in China, given that an estimated 20 million people seek jobs every year (including migrant workers who move to urban centers and high school and college graduates). According to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), China was the single most important contributor to world economic growth in 2007. Thus, a Chinese economic slowdown (or recovery) could also have significant global implications. The extent of China's exposure to the current global financial crisis, in particular from the fallout of the U.S. sub-prime mortgage problem, is unclear. On the one hand, China places numerous restrictions on capital flows, particularly outflows, in part so that it can maintain its managed float currency policy. These restrictions limit the ability of Chinese citizens and many firms to invest their savings overseas, compelling them to invest those savings domestically, (such as in banks, the stock markets, real estate, and business ventures), although some Chinese attempt to shift funds overseas illegally. Thus, the exposure of Chinese private sector firms and individual Chinese investors to sub-prime U.S. mortgages is likely to be small. Moreover, Chinese government entities, such as the State Administration of Foreign Exchange, the China Investment Corporation (a $200 billion sovereign wealth fund created in 2007), state banks, and state-owned enterprises, may have been more exposed to troubled U.S. mortgage securities. Chinese government entities account for the lion's share of China's (legal) capital outflows, much of which derives from China's large and growing foreign exchange reserves. These reserves rose from $403 billion in 2003 (year end) to $2.1 trillion as of June 2009. In order to earn interest on these holdings, the Chinese government invests in overseas assets. A large portion of China's reserves are believed to be invested in U.S. securities, such as long-term (LT) Treasury debt (used to finance the federal deficit), LT U.S. agency debt (such as Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae mortgage-backed securities), LT U.S. corporate debt, LT U.S. equities, and short-term (ST) debt. The Treasury Department estimates that, as of June 2008, China's holdings of U.S. securities totaled $1,205 billion (up from $922 billion in June 2007), making it the second-largest foreign holder of such securities (after Japan). Of this total, $527 billion were in LT U.S. agency securities, $522 billion were in LT Treasury securities, $100 billion in LT equities, $26 billion in LT corporate securities, and $30 billion in ST debt. If China held troubled sub-prime mortgage backed securities, they would likely be included in the corporate securities category and certain U.S. equities (which include investment company share funds, such as open-end funds, closed-end funds, money market mutual funds, and hedge funds) which may have been invested in real estate. However, these were a relatively small share of China's total U.S. securities holdings. China's holdings of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac securities (though not their stock) were likely to have been more substantial, but less risky (compared to other mortgage-backed securities), especially after these two institutions were placed in conservatorship by the Federal Government in September 2008 and thus have government backing. The Chinese government generally does not release detailed information on the holdings of its financial entities, although some of its banks have reported on their level of exposure to sub-prime U.S. mortgages. Such entities have generally reported that their exposure to troubled sub-prime U.S. mortgages has been minor relative to their total investments, that they have liquidated such assets and/or have written off losses, and that they (the banks) continue to earn high profit margins. For example, the Bank of China (one of China's largest state-owned commercial banks) reported in March 2008 that its investment in asset-backed securities supported by U.S. sub-prime mortgages totaled $10.6 billion in 2006 (accounting for 3.5% of its investment securities portfolio). In October 2008, it reported that it had reduced holdings of such securities to $3.3 billion (1.4% of its total securities investments) by the end of September 2008, while its holdings of debt securities issued or backed by Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae were at $10 billion. Fitch Ratings service reported that the Bank of China's exposure to U.S. sub-prime-related investments was the largest among Asian financial institutions, and that further losses from these investments were likely, but went on to state that the Bank of China would be able to absorb any related losses ""without undue strain."" However, China's economy has not been immune to effects of the global financial crisis, given its heavy reliance on trade and foreign direct investment (FDI) for its economic growth. Numerous sectors were hard hit. To illustrate: The real estate market in several Chinese cities experienced a sharp slowdown in construction, falling prices and growing levels of unoccupied buildings. This increased pressure on the banks to lower interest rates further to stabilize the market. The value of China's main stock market index, the Shanghai Stock Exchange Composite Index, lost nearly two-thirds of its value from December 31, 2007, to December 31, 2008. China's trade and FDI plummeted sharply, as indicated in Figure 2 . Exports and imports from January-July 2009 were down 22.0% and 23.6%, respectively on a year-on-year basis; they declined 10 straight months beginning in November 2008. FDI flows to China from January-July 2009 were down 20.4%; they declined for 10 consecutive months beginning in October 2008 (year-on-year basis). The Chinese government in January 2009 estimated that 20 million migrant workers alone had lost their jobs in 2008 because of the global economic slowdown. During the first four months of 2009, industrial output rose by 5.5% year-on-year, well below the 12.9% growth rate in 2008. China has taken a number of steps to respond to the global financial crisis. On September 27, 2008, Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao reportedly stated that ""what we can do now is to maintain the steady and fast growth of the national economy, and ensure that no major fluctuations will happen. That will be our greatest contribution to the world economy under the current circumstances."" In addition to cutting interest rates and boosting bank lending, China has implemented a number of policies to stimulate and rebalance the economy, increase consumer spending, restructure and subsidize certain industries, and boost incomes for farmers and rural poor. On November 9, 2008, the Chinese government announced it would implement a two-year, 4 trillion yuan ($586 billion) stimulus package (equivalent to 13.3% of China's 2008 GDP), largely dedicated to infrastructure projects. The package would finance public transport infrastructure (including railways, highways, airports, and ports) affordable housing, rural infrastructure (including irrigation, drinking water, electricity, and transport), environmental projects, technological innovation, health and education, and rebuilding areas hit by disasters (such as areas that were hit by the May 12, 2008 earthquake, primarily in Sichuan province). China's stimulus, if fully implemented, would likely constitute one of the largest economic stimulus packages (both in spending levels and as a percent of GDP) that have been announced by the world's major economies to date, although it is unclear to what extent the stimulus package represents new spending versus projects that were already in the works before the economic downturn hit China. Table 1 provides a breakdown of the stimulus program spending priorities. The Chinese stimulus program includes steps the government intends to take to assist 10 pillar industries (i.e., industries deemed by the government to be vital to China's economic growth) to promote their long-term competitiveness. These industries include autos, steel, shipbuilding, textiles, machinery, electronics and information, light industry (such as consumer products), petrochemicals, non-ferrous metals, and logistics. Government support policies for the 10 industries are expected to include tax cuts and incentives (including export tax rebates), industry subsidies and subsidies to consumers to purchase certain products (such as consumer goods and autos), fiscal support, directives to banks to provide financing, direct funds to support technology upgrades and the development of domestic brands, government procurement policies, the extension of export credits, and funding to help firms invest overseas. On April 7, 2009, the Chinese government announced plans to spend $124 billion over the next three years to create a universal health care system. The plan would attempt to extend basic coverage to most of the population by 2011, and would invest in public hospitals and training for village and community doctors. A number of efforts have been made to boost rural incomes and spending levels and to narrow the gap in living standards between rural and urban citizens (as well as between coastal and western regions of the country). For example, since February 2009, an estimated 900 million Chinese rural residents have been eligible to receive a 13% rebate for purchase of home appliances. Public housing projects, education, and infrastructure projects are largely targeted to rural areas. The government has also announced plans to boost agricultural subsidies to farmers. On June 24, 2009, China's State Council launched a new pilot rural pension program that will initially cover 10 percent of China's counties beginning in October 2009 (Currently most rural farmers are not covered by pension system). Chinese officials contend that their economic policy efforts are beginning to produce results. They note a number of positive developments: GDP in the second quarter of 2009 grew by 7.9%, compared to 6.1% growth in the first quarter 2009, on a year-on-year basis. Several economic forecasting firms have recently predicted a strong Chinese economic recovery. For example, Global Insight in August 2009, predicted China's real GDP would grow 8.0% in 2009 and 10.1% in 2010, while the Economist Intelligence Unit projected real growth at 8.0% for both years. China's Shanghai Stock Exchange Composite Index has risen by 67.3% since the beginning of the year (through August 14, 2009. A number of sectors have enjoyed healthy growth during the first seven months of 2009. Although they have not achieved levels that occurred before the global economic crisis, they could signify that a recovery is taking place. For example, retail sales were up 15% (6.7 percentage points lower than in the previous, urban fixed-asset investment rose 32.9% (0.7% percentage points lower), and industrial output rose by 7.5% (8.6 percentage points lower). Real estate prices in major cities have also begun to rise over the past few months. Although there are many indicators of a Chinese economic recovery (with the exception of trade and FDI flows), there are numerous concerns over long-term growth prospects. Many analysts note that much of the recent economic growth that has occurred has resulted from large-scale bank lending and infrastructure spending projects, rather than consumer spending. In addition, many analysts have raised concerns that the large level of borrowing by local governments and state-owned enterprises could lead to a sharp rise in non-performing loans on the balance sheets of China's major banks, and could cause local governments to be become heavily indebted. Many analysts are also concerned that the stimulus policies that China has implemented to date could slow efforts to further reform the economy, especially in regards to state-owned enterprises and the banking system. Some have charged that China has rolled backed some it its economic reforms by boosting industrial subsidies and increasing trade and investment barriers, in order to assist firms deemed by the government to be vital to future development. China has also imposed ""buy China"" regulations to prevent participation by foreign firms and ensure that stimulus money benefit only Chinese firms. Many economists contend that China's long-term economic growth prospects will likely depend on the ability of the government to rebalance the economy by promoting greater domestic consumption and to deepen market-oriented economic reforms. Thus, China's current economic recovery could be short-lived. Analysts debate what role China might play in responding to the global financial crisis, given its huge foreign exchange reserves (at over $2 trillion) but its relative reluctance to become a major player in global economic affairs and its tendency to be cautious with its reserves. Some have speculated that China may, in order to help stabilize its most important trading partner (the United States), boost purchases of U.S. securities (especially Treasury securities) in order to help fund the hundreds of billions of dollars that are expected to be spent by the U.S. government to purchase troubled assets and stimulate the economy. Additionally, China might try to shore up the U.S. economy by buying U.S. stocks (or might do so to take advantage of relatively low prices). During her visit to China on February 21, 2009, Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton stated that she appreciated ""greatly the Chinese government's continuing confidence in the United States Treasuries,"" and she urged the government to continue to buy U.S. debt. Some contend that taking an active role to help the United States (and other troubled economies) would boost China's image as a positive contributor to world economic stability, similar to what occurred during the 1997-1998 Asian financial crisis when it offered financial aid to Thailand and pledged not to devalue its currency. On the other hand, there are a number of reasons why China might be reluctant to significantly increase its investments of U.S. assets. One concern could be whether increased Chinese investments in the U.S. economy would produce long-term economic benefits for China. Some Chinese investments in U.S. financial companies have fared poorly, and Chinese officials could be reluctant to put additional money into investments that were deemed to be too risky. Secondly, a sharp economic downturn of the Chinese economy would likely increase pressure to invest money at home, rather than overseas. Many analysts (including some in China) have questioned the wisdom of China's policy of investing a large volume of foreign exchange reserves in U.S. government securities (which offer a relatively low rate of return) when China has such huge development needs at home. China's holdings of U.S. securities at the end of 2008 are estimated to have been roughly equivalent to over $1,000 per person in China, a significant figure for a country with a per capita GDP of about $3,190 (2008). On March 13, 2009, Wen Jiabao at a news conference stated that he was ""a little bit worried"" about the safety of Chinese assets in the United States On March 24, 2009, the governor of the People's Bank of China, Zhou Xiaochuan, published a paper calling for the replacing the U.S. dollar as the international reserve currency with a new global system controlled by the International Monetary Fund. Many analysts (including some in China) have questioned the wisdom of China's policy of investing a large level of foreign exchange reserves in U.S. government securities, which offer a relatively low rate of return when China has such huge development needs at home. While additional large-scale Chinese purchases of U.S. securities might provide short-term benefits to the U.S. economy and may be welcomed by some policymakers, they could also raise a number of issues and concerns. Some U.S. policymakers have expressed concern that China might try to use its large holdings of U.S. securities as leverage against U.S. policies it opposes. For example, various Chinese government officials reportedly suggested on a number of occasions in the past that China could dump (or threaten to dump) a large share of its holdings in order to counter U.S. pressure (such as threats of trade sanctions) on various trade issues (such as China's currency policy). In exchange for new purchases of U.S. debt, China would likely want U.S. policymakers to lower expectations that China will move more rapidly to reform its financial sector and/or allow its currency to appreciate more substantially against the dollar. Some analysts have suggested that China could choose to utilize its reserves to buy stakes in various distressed U.S. industries. However, this could also raise concerns in the United States that China was being allowed to buy equity or ownership in U.S. firms at rock bottom prices, that technology and intellectual property from acquired firms could be transferred to Chinese business entities (boosting their competitiveness vis-a-vis U.S. firms), and that becoming a large stakeholder in major U.S. companies could give the Chinese government increased political influence in the United States. U.S. policymakers in the past have sometimes opposed attempts by Chinese firms to acquire shares or ownership of U.S. firms. While attending the G-20 summit in London on the global financial crisis on April 1, 2009, President Obama and President Hu met and pledged ""to work together to resolutely support global trade and investment flows, ""resist protectionism,"" and to resume high-level cooperation on long-term economic issues under the Strategic and Economic Dialogue (S&ED). The first round of the S&ED was held in Washington, D.C. on July 27-28, 2009. The two sides agreed to continue cooperation on a number of economic fronts, including promoting balanced economic growth and financial reforms. It is unclear to what extent the global financial crisis will affect U.S.-Chinese economic ties. Prior to the crisis, U.S. officials urged China to adopt economic reforms, especially in terms of the financial system, in ways that would emulate the U.S. economic model. Once the economic crisis hit, China was quick to blame U.S. economic policies for the crisis, and thus, U.S. influence with China on economic issues may have waned somewhat. China's increased use of subsides, ""buy China"" procurement regulations, and trade and investment barriers could increase pressure in the United States to utilize U.S. trade laws against unfair trade practices and/or to provide temporary relief to U.S. firms and workers injured by import surges from China. Chinese officials have countered with their own complaints over rising U.S. ""protectionism."" Although China has attempted to diversify its large foreign exchange holdings and to make its currency more convertible in international exchange markets (such as through currency swap arrangements with various countries), it is unlikely ( at least in the near term) to make major changes to its heavy reliance on the dollar as its main source of foreign exchange reserves (and investments in dollar-denominated assets), nor is China in a position to make its currency fully convertible in international exchange rate markets (due to the relative weakness of its banking system). However, Chinese officials are deeply concerned over the security of their dollar holdings if the dollar undergoes a sharp depreciation against major currencies in the future (possibly arising from rising U.S. public debt). Such concerns may also spur the Chinese government to take more steps to promote domestic consumption, and lessen dependence on trade and FDI flows, as a source of economic growth.","Over the past several years, China has enjoyed one of the world's fastest-growing economies and has been a major contributor to world economic growth. However, the current global financial crisis has significantly slowed China's economy; real gross domestic product (GDP) fell from 13.0% in 2007 to 8.0% in 2008. Several Chinese industries, particularly the export sector, have been hit hard by crisis, and millions of workers have reportedly been laid off. This situation is of great concern to the Chinese government, which views rapid economic growth as critical to maintaining social stability. China is a major economic power and holds huge amounts of foreign exchange reserves, and thus its policies could have a major impact on the global economy. The Chinese government has stated that it plans to rebalance the economy by lessening its dependence on exports for economic growth while boosting domestic demand. In November 2008, the Chinese government announced a $586 billion spending package to help stimulate the domestic economy, largely geared towards new infrastructure projects. In addition, the government ordered banks to sharply expand loans to local governments and businesses to expand investment. The government has also offered a number of programs to stimulate domestic consumption of consumer products (such as cars and appliances), especially in the rural areas. As a result, China's economy has shown some improvement. For example, its GDP in the second quarter of 2009 grew by 7.9%, compared to 6.1% growth in the first quarter 2009, on a year-on-year basis. However, from January to July 2009, China's trade was down 23% over the same period in 2008, while foreign direct investment fell 18%. Some analysts have criticized various aspects of China's economic stimulus policies. Some contend that China, in an effort to assist firms impacted by the global economic slowdown, has imposed numerous new trade-distorting policies, such as extensive industrial subsidies and trade and investment restrictions on foreign firms. In addition, many analysts warn that the easy lending policies of Chinese state-owned banks may later lead to a sharp increase in the level of non-performing loans by these banks if loans go to investments that fail to produce long-term returns. China's efforts to stabilize its economy are of major concern to U.S. policy makers. If successful, such policies could boost Chinese demand for U.S. products. In addition, China is a major purchaser of U.S. Treasury securities, which help fund the Federal Government's borrowing needs, and thus its decision whether or not to continue to purchase U.S. debt could impact the U.S. economy. U.S. policy makers also want to ensure that, despite the sharp downturn in the Chinese economy from the effects of current global economic downturn, China will continue to reform its economy and liberalizes its trade regime and refrain from imposing policies that restrict or distort trade.",govreport
"Banks play a central role in the financial system by connecting borrowers to savers and allocating capital across the economy. As a result, banking is vital to the health and growth of the U.S. economy. In addition, banking is an inherently risky activity involving extending credit and taking on liabilities. Therefore, banking can generate tremendous societal and economic benefits, but banking panics and failures can create devastating losses. Over time, a regulatory system designed to foster the benefits of banking while limiting risks has developed, and both banks and regulation have coevolved as market conditions have changed and different risks have emerged. For these reasons, Congress often considers policies related to the banking industry. Recent years have been a particularly transformative period for banking. The 2008-2009 financial crisis threatened the total collapse of the financial system and the real economy. Many assert only huge and unprecedented government interventions staved off this collapse. Others argue that government interventions were unnecessary or potentially exacerbated the crisis. In addition, many argue the crisis revealed that the financial system was excessively risky and the regulatory system had serious weaknesses. Many regulatory changes were made in response to perceived weaknesses in the financial regulatory system, including to bank regulation. Congress enacted the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act ( P.L. 111-203 ; Dodd-Frank Act) in 2010 with the intention of strengthening regulation and addressing risks. In addition, U.S. and international bank regulators agreed to the Basel III Accords—an international framework for bank regulation—which called for making certain bank regulations more stringent. In the ensuing years, some observers have raised concerns that the potential benefits of the regulatory changes (better-managed risks, increased consumer protection, greater systemic stability, etc.) are outweighed by the potential costs (e.g., reduced credit availability for consumers and businesses, and slower economic growth). Meanwhile, market forces and economic conditions continue to affect the banking industry coincident with the implementation of new regulation. This report provides a broad overview of selected banking-related issues, including prudential regulation, consumer protection, ""too big to fail"" (TBTF) banks, community banking, regulatory agency structures and independence, and recent market and economic trends. It is not an exhaustive look at all bank policy issues, nor is it a detailed examination of any one issue. Rather, it provides concise background and analyses of certain prominent issues that have been the subject of recent discussion and debate. In addition, this report provides a list of Congressional Research Service reports that examine specific bills—including the Financial CHOICE Act ( H.R. 10 ) and the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act ( S. 2155 ). Bank failures can inflict large losses on stakeholders, including taxpayers via government ""safety nets"" such as deposit insurance and Federal Reserve lending facilities. Furthermore, some argue that in the presence of deposit insurance, commercial banks may be subject to moral hazard —a willingness to take on excessive risk because of external protection against losses. In addition, failures can cause systemic stress and sharp contraction in economic activity if they are large or widespread. To make such failures less likely—and to reduce losses when they do occur—regulators utilize prudential regulation. These ""safety and soundness"" regulations are designed to ensure banks are safely profitable and to reduce the risk of failure. This section provides background on these regulations and analyzes selected issues related to them, including regulatory requirements related to capital ratios, including leverage ratios and risk-weighted capital ratios; and restrictions on permissible activities, such as the Volcker Rule (which restricts proprietary trading). A bank's balance sheet is divided into assets, liabilities, and capital. Assets are largely the value of loans owed to the bank and securities owned by the bank. To make loans and buy securities, a bank secures funding by either issuing liabilities or raising capital. A bank's liabilities are largely the value of deposits and borrowings the bank owes savers and creditors. Capital is raised through various methods, including issuing equity to shareholders or issuing special types of bonds that can be converted into equity. Capital—unlike liabilities—does not require repayment of a specified amount of money, and so its value can fluctuate. Banks profit in part because many of their assets are generally riskier, longer-term, and more illiquid than their liabilities, which allows the banks to earn more interest on their assets than they pay on their liabilities. The practice is usually profitable, but does expose banks to risks that can potentially lead to failure. While the value of bank assets can decrease, liabilities generally cannot. Capital, though, gives the bank the ability to absorb losses. When asset value declines, capital value does as well, allowing the bank to meet its rigid liability obligations and avoid failure. Based on these balance sheet characteristics, failures can be reduced if (1) banks are better able to absorb losses or (2) they are less likely to experience unsustainably large losses. To increase the ability to absorb losses, regulators can require banks to hold a minimum level of capital, liquidity, or stable funding. These levels are expressed as ratios between items on bank balance sheets and are called regulatory ratio requirements . To reduce the likelihood and size of potential losses, regulators prohibit banks from activities that could create excessive risks, implementing permissible activity restrictions . Banks have been subject to ratio requirements for decades. U.S. bank regulators first established explicit numerical ratio requirements in 1981. In 1988, they adopted the Basel Capital Accords proposed by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS)—an international group of bank regulators that sets international standards—which were the precursor to the ratio requirement regime used in the United States today. Those requirements—now known as ""Basel I""—were revised in 2004, establishing the ""Basel II"" requirements that were in effect at the onset of the crisis in 2008. In 2010, the BCBS agreed to the ""Basel III"" standards. Pursuant to this agreement, U.S. regulators finalized new capital requirements in 2013, with full implementation expected by 2019; finalized a liquidity requirement for large banks in 2014, with full implementation expected in 2017; and proposed a funding ratio for large banks in 2016. Restrictions on permissible activities have also evolved over time and generally were made more stringent following the crisis to address potential weaknesses. Historical examples of such restrictions are found in Sections 16, 20, 21, and 32 of the Banking Act of 1933 (P.L. 73-66)—commonly referred to as the Glass-Steagall Act. Glass-Steagall generally prohibited certain deposit-taking banks from engaging in certain securities markets activities associated with investment banks, such as speculative investment in equity securities. Over time, regulators became more permissive in their interpretation of Glass-Steagall, allowing banks to participate in more securities market activities, directly or through affiliations. In 1999, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act repealed two provisions of Glass-Steagall, further expanding permissible activities for certain banks. The financial crisis elevated the debate over what activities banks should be allowed to engage in. Certain provisions in Dodd-Frank placed restrictions on permissible activities to reduce banks' riskiness. Section 619 of Dodd-Frank—often referred to as the ""Volcker Rule""—differs from Glass-Steagall provisions in important ways. However, it was generally designed to achieve a similar goal of separating proprietary trading —owning and trading securities for the bank's own portfolio with the aim of profiting from price changes—from depository banking. Banks are required to satisfy several different regulatory ratio requirements. A detailed examination of how these ratios are calculated is beyond the scope of this report. This examination of the policy issue only requires noting that capital ratios fall into one of two main types—a leverage ratio or a risk-weighted ratio. A leverage ratio treats all assets the same, requiring banks to hold the same amount of capital against the asset regardless of how risky each asset is. A risk-weighted ratio assigns a risk weight—a number based on the riskiness of the asset that the asset value is multiplied by—to account for the fact that some assets are more likely to lose value than others. Riskier assets receive a higher risk weight, which requires banks to hold more capital—to better enable them to absorb losses—to meet the ratio requirement. In regard to the simple leverage ratio, most banks are required to meet a 4% leverage ratio. The required risk-weighted ratios depend on bank size and capital quality (some types of capital are considered to be less effective at absorbing losses than other types, and thus considered lower quality). Most banks are required to meet a 4.5% risk-weighted ratio for the highest-quality capital and a ratio of between 6% and 8% for lower-quality capital. Banks are then required to have an additional 2.5% of high-quality capital on top of those levels as part of the ""capital conservation buffer."" The largest banks are required to hold more capital than smaller, less complex banks. These ratios for large banks will be covered in the "" Enhanced Prudential Regulation "" section below. Some observers argue that it is important to have both a risk-weighted ratio and a leverage ratio because the two complement each other. Riskier assets generally offer a greater rate of return to compensate the investor for bearing more risk. Without risk weighting, banks would have an incentive to hold riskier assets because the same amount of capital must be held against risky and safe assets. Therefore, a leverage ratio alone may not fully account for a bank's riskiness because a bank with a high concentration of very risky assets could have a similar ratio to a bank with a high concentration of very safe assets. However, others assert the use of risk-weighted ratios should be limited. Risk weights assigned to particular classes of assets could potentially be an inaccurate estimation of some assets' true risk, especially since they cannot be adjusted as quickly as asset risk might change. Banks may have an incentive to overly invest in assets with risk weights that are set too low (they would receive the high potential rate of return of a risky asset, but have to hold only enough capital to protect against losses of a safe asset), or inversely to underinvest in assets with risk weights that are set too high. Some observers believe that the risk weights in place prior to the financial crisis were poorly calibrated and ""encouraged financial firms to crowd into"" risky assets, exacerbating the downturn. For example, banks held highly rated mortgage-backed securities (MBSs) before the crisis, in part because those assets offered a higher rate of return than other assets with the same risk weight. MBSs then suffered unexpectedly large losses during the crisis. Another criticism is that the risk-weighted system involves ""needless complexity"" and is an example of regulator micromanagement. The complexity could benefit the largest banks that have the resources to absorb the added regulatory cost compared to small banks that could find compliance costs more burdensome. Community bank compliance issues will be covered in more detail in the "" Regulatory Burden on Community Banks "" section later in the report. In addition to the specific issue of whether to use both leverage and risk-weighted ratios or just a leverage ratio, the role regulatory ratios in general play in bank regulation is a broader issue. Prudential regulation involves requirements besides capital ratios, such as liquidity requirements, asset concentration guidelines, and counterparty limits. Some argue that capital is essential to absorbing losses and, as long as sufficient capital is in place, banks should not be subject to some of these additional regulatory restrictions. However, others believe that the different components of prudential regulation each play an important role in ensuring the safety and soundness of financial institutions and are essential complements to bank capital. Finally, whether the benefits of prudential regulation—such as the increase in bank safety and the increase in financial system stability—are outweighed by the potential costs of reduced credit availability and economic growth is an issue subject to much debate. Capital is typically a more expensive source of funding for banks than liabilities. Thus, requiring banks to hold higher levels of capital may make funding more expensive, and so banks may choose to reduce the amount of credit available. Some studies indicate this could slow economic growth. However, no economic consensus exists on this issue, because a more stable banking system with fewer crises and failures may lead to higher long-run economic growth. In addition, estimating the value of regulatory costs and benefits is subject to considerable uncertainty, due to difficulties and assumptions involved in complex economic modeling and estimation. Therefore, this issue is unlikely to be conclusively resolved quickly or easily. If Congress decides to reduce regulatory reliance on risk-weighted ratios, it could provide a statutory exemption for banks that otherwise demonstrate they are operating in a safe manner from being subject to risk-weighted ratios. These banks' regulatory burden could be further reduced by exempting them from other prudential regulation, such as liquidity requirements, stress-testing, and dividend limitations. Exempted banks could include those that satisfy a higher simple leverage ratio, or receive a high safety and soundness rating from the bank's prudential regulator. Another possible set of changes would be to change the risk weights assigned to specific asset classes. For example, in the case that an asset type was assigned a risk weight that was too high and would likely cause unwanted market distortions, Congress could mandate that asset type be assigned a lower weight. The Volcker Rule generally prohibits depository banks from engaging in proprietary trading or sponsoring a hedge fund or private equity fund. Proponents argue that proprietary trading would add further risk to the inherently risky business of commercial banking. Furthermore, because other types of institutions are very active in proprietary trading and better suited for it, bank involvement is unnecessary for the financial system. Finally, proponents assert moral hazard is problematic for banks in these risky activities. Because deposits—an important source of bank funding—are insured by the government, a bank could potentially take on excessive risk without concern about losing this funding. Thus, support for the Volcker Rule has often been posed as preventing banks from ""gambling"" in securities markets with taxpayer-backed deposits. Some observers doubt the necessity of the Volcker Rule. They assert that proprietary trading at commercial banks did not play a role in the financial crisis, noting that issues that played a direct role in the crisis—including failures of large investment banks and insurers and losses on loans held by commercial banks—would not have been prevented by the rule. The effectiveness of the Volcker Rule in reducing bank risk is also disputed. While the activities prohibited under the Volcker Rule pose risks, it is not clear whether they pose greater risks to bank solvency and financial stability than ""traditional"" banking activities, such as mortgage lending. Furthermore, taking on additional risks in different markets might diversify a bank's risk profile, making it less likely to fail. Some suggest that restricting certain activities only at depository bank subsidiaries and allowing them at completely separate nonbank subsidiaries may appropriately protect deposits while allowing diversification in the larger organization. Some contend that the Volcker Rule imposes a regulatory burden that could affect banks' involvement in beneficial trading activities and reduce financial market efficiency. The rule includes exceptions for when bank trading is deemed appropriate—such as when a bank is hedging against risks and market-making. This poses practical supervisory problems. For example, how can regulators determine whether a broker-dealer is holding a security for market-making, as a hedge against another risk, or as a speculative investment? Differentiating among these motives creates regulatory complexity and compliance costs that could affect bank trading behavior. In addition, whether relatively small banks should be exempt from the rule is a debated issue. Some observers contend that the vast majority of community banks do not face compliance obligations under the rule and do not face an excessive burden by being subject to it. They argue that community banks subject to compliance requirements, those with traditional hedging activities, can comply simply by having clear policies and procedures in place that can be reviewed during the normal examination process. In addition, they assert the community banks that are engaged in complex trading should have the expertise to comply with the Volcker Rule. Others argue that the act of evaluating the Volcker Rule to ensure banks' compliance is burdensome in and of itself. They support a community bank exemption so that community banks and supervisors would not have to dedicate resources to complying with and enforcing a regulation whose rationale is unlikely to apply to smaller banks. Several different approaches are available if Congress decided to amend the prohibitions mandated by the Volcker Rule. If it is determined that any ban on proprietary trading by commercial banks is unnecessary, unduly burdensome, or too difficult to enforce, then Congress could repeal the rule and not replace it with different prohibitions. If instead the issue is that the rule as currently formulated is problematic, then Congress could repeal the rule and replace it with different provisions, perhaps similar to those in the Glass-Steagall Act. Finally, if it is only the rule's applicability to small banks that is problematic, Congress could enact an exemption for a certain class of banks. Financial products can be complex and potentially difficult for consumers to fully understand. Also, consumers seeking loans or financial services could be vulnerable to deceptive or unfair practices. To reduce the occurrence of bad outcomes, laws and regulations have been put in place to protect consumers. This section provides background on consumer protection and analyzes issues related to it, including the degree to which the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's (CFPB's) authorities, structure, regulations, and enforcement actions have struck the appropriate balance between protecting consumers and the availability of credit; and whether certain mortgage lending rules have struck the appropriate balance between protecting consumers and the availability of credit. Financial transactions are subject to various state and federal laws designed to protect consumers and ensure that lenders use fair lending practices. Federal laws and regulations take a variety of approaches and address different areas of concern. Disclosure requirements are intended to ensure consumers adequately understand the costs and other features and terms of financial products. Unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts and practices are prohibited. Fair lending laws prohibit discrimination in credit transactions based upon certain borrower characteristics, including sex, race, religion, or age, among others. In addition, banks are subject to consumer compliance regulation, intended to ensure that banks are in compliance with relevant consumer-protection and fair-lending laws. For many observers, the onset of the financial crisis revealed weaknesses in the regulatory system as it related to consumer protection. In particular, many observers assert mortgages that were made using weak underwriting standards and arguably deceptive practices precipitated the crisis when the borrowers defaulted at increasingly high rates. In response, the Dodd-Frank Act established the CFPB—a new regulatory agency focused on consumer protection in financial transactions with wide-reaching authorities to regulate consumer financial products such as mortgages. In addition, other Dodd-Frank provisions directed agencies—including banking regulators and the CFPB—to implement new mortgage lending rules and amend existing ones. Prior to the Dodd-Frank Act, federal banking regulators—the Federal Reserve Board, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation—were charged with the two-pronged mandate of regulating for both safety and soundness (prudential regulation, discussed in previous sections) as well as consumer compliance. The CFPB was established with the single mandate to implement and enforce federal consumer financial law while ensuring consumers can access financial products and services. The CFPB also works to ensure the markets for consumer financial services and products are fair, transparent, and competitive. To achieve these outcomes, the CFPB was granted certain regulatory authorities over banks, as well as certain other nonbank providers of consumer products and services. Those powers vary based on whether a bank holds more or less than $10 billion in assets. Regulatory authorities related to consumer compliance fall into three broad categories: supervisory , which includes the power to examine and impose reporting requirements on financial institutions; enforcement of various consumer-protection laws and regulations; and rulemaking , which includes the power to prescribe regulations pursuant to federal consumer-protection laws that govern a broad and diverse set of consumer financial activities and services. For banks with more than $10 billion in assets, the CFPB is the primary regulator for consumer compliance, whereas safety and soundness regulation continues to be performed by the prudential regulator. As a regulator of larger banks, the CFPB has rulemaking, supervisory, and enforcement authorities. A large bank, therefore, has different regulators for consumer protection and safety and soundness. For banks with $10 billion or less in assets, the rulemaking, supervisory, and enforcement authorities for consumer protection are divided between the CFPB and a prudential regulator. The CFPB may issue rules that apply to smaller banks, but the prudential regulators maintain primary supervisory and enforcement authority for consumer protection. The CFPB has limited supervisory and enforcement powers over small banks. It can participate in examinations performed by the prudential regulator on a sampling basis. Also, the CFPB may refer potential enforcement actions against small banks to the banks' prudential regulators, but the prudential regulators are not bound to take any substantive steps beyond responding to the referral. The CFPB has been a controversial product of the Dodd-Frank Act. Some observers question if the CFPB as an institution is structured appropriately to achieve the correct balance between independence on the one hand and transparency and accountability on the other. The CFPB is led by a director rather than a board and is funded by the Federal Reserve rather than the traditional appropriations process. Some argue that a single director leads to a lack of diversity of viewpoints, and that funding outside the traditional appropriations process could result in a lack of accountability at an agency. The CFPB's relatively narrow mandate and the ""for cause"" removal protection for its director are also contentious issues. However, supporters of the CFPB argue other aspects of its structure provide sufficient transparency and accountability, including the director's biannual testimony before Congress and the cap on CFPB funding. They further argue it is important to ensure the CFPB is somewhat insulated from political pressures and can focus on the technical aspect of policymaking. This issue as it relates to all financial regulators is further examined in the section entitled "" Regulatory Agency Design and Independence "" found later in this report. Another policy issue is whether the CFPB's rulemaking and enforcement have struck an appropriate balance between protecting consumers and ensuring that consumers have access to financial products. The CFPB has implemented rules mandated by the Dodd-Frank Act, but regulations it has promulgated under its general authorities—such as oversight of auto lending and a rule that extends credit card-like protections to prepaid cards—are at the center of this debate. Some observers assert lenders have been subject to unduly burdensome regulations and overzealous enforcement by the CFPB in recent years, resulting in costs that outweigh the benefits. They argue that CFPB regulation increases the cost of providing certain financial products to the point that institutions reduce the availability of needed credit sources. However, the CFPB came under new leadership on November 27, 2017, and has indicated it will review aspects of its regulation and enforcement. Some observers have since asserted that certain alterations in CFPB regulation and enforcement since the leadership change have made the agency too lenient toward certain financial service providers and unduly weakened consumer protections. Other observers believe the CFPB has struck an appropriate balance in its rulemaking between protecting consumers and ensuring that credit availability is not restricted due to overly burdensome regulations on financial institutions. Analysis of whether or the degree to which recent rulemakings have restricted the availability of credit is complicated by the concurrent effects of economic conditions and the financial crisis on credit conditions. Also, many significant CFPB rulemakings have been in effect only since early 2014 or later, and the lack of a track record and data is an additional barrier to conclusive examination of the issue. A third issue is whether the $10 billion asset threshold at which the CFPB becomes a bank's primary regulator for consumer compliance is set at an appropriate level. Many think having two separate agencies handle supervision for prudential regulation and consumer protection compliance would be unnecessarily burdensome for small banks. However, there is disagreement over the size at which that becomes the case. Supporters of raising the threshold argue it would appropriately reduce the regulatory burden on banks that are still relatively small, and ""would still be examined by their primary regulators who are required by law to enforce the CFPB rules and regulations,"" and the change would only mean banks ""wouldn't have to go through yet another exam with the CFPB in addition to the ones they already have to go through with their primary regulators."" Critics of raising the threshold argue it exempts large institutions that warrant closer supervision. They note that banks that were ""some of the worst violators of consumer protections"" in the housing bubble were fairly close to that threshold, with IndyMac at approximately $30 billion in assets being a highlighted example. Broadly, if Congress decided to restrict the CFPB's regulatory authority in financial markets, it could alter its mandate, structure, or authorities. If it is determined that the CFPB is overly focused on consumer protection to the extent that it is restricting credit availability, the agency's mandate could be expanded to a dual mandate that includes the goal of expanding consumer credit availability. Agency accountability could be increased by bringing it into the appropriations process or altering features of its leadership (e.g., by removing the director's ""for cause"" protections or replacing the directorship with a commission or board). In addition, CFPB rulemaking, supervisory, or enforcement authorities could be altered or removed. During the early 2000s, housing prices and sales—and the origination of home mortgages to finance the sales—increased rapidly. However, the housing boom subsequently was revealed to be a ""bubble""—the real economic forces that should underpin the housing market did not warrant the rapid expansion. In 2007, home prices began falling resulting in reduced household wealth, which in turn resulted in a surge in mortgage defaults, delinquencies, and foreclosures. Ultimately, the bursting of the bubble would play a significant role in the cascade of events that culminated in the financial crisis. Many factors contributed to the housing bubble and its collapse, and there is significant debate about the underlying causes even a decade later. Many observers, however, point to relaxed mortgage underwriting standards, an expansion of nontraditional mortgage products, and misaligned incentives among various participants as underlying causes. These features arguably led to too many mortgages being made imprudently by lenders to borrowers who would not repay them. Mortgage lending has long been subject to regulations intended to protect homeowners and to prevent risky loans, but the issues evident in the financial crisis spurred calls for reform. The Dodd-Frank Act made a number of changes to the mortgage system. For example, the law required lenders to use certain documented and verified information to determine whether a prospective borrower had the ability to repay the loan and increased the amount of data lenders would have to report under the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act ( P.L. 94-200 ). A long-standing issue in the regulation of mortgages and other consumer financial services is the perceived trade-off between protecting consumers and the availability of credit. Providers of financial goods and services may incur costs to ensure they are complying with all applicable laws and regulations. If regulation intended to protect consumers increases the cost of providing a financial product, a company may—depending on market factors and business considerations—reduce how much of that product it is willing to provide, and may provide it more selectively. Those who still receive the product may benefit from the enhanced disclosure or added legal protections of the regulation, but that benefit may result in a higher price for the product. Some policymakers generally believe that the postcrisis mortgage rules have struck the appropriate balance between protecting consumers and ensuring that credit availability is not restricted due to overly burdensome regulations. They contend that the regulations are intended to prevent those unable to repay their loans from receiving credit and have been appropriately tailored to ensure that those who can repay are able to receive credit. Critics counter that some rules have imposed compliance costs on lenders of all sizes, resulting in less credit available to consumers and restricting the types of products available to them. Some assert this is especially true for certain types of mortgages, such as mortgages for homes in rural areas or for manufactured housing. They further argue that the rules for certain types of lenders, usually small lenders, are unduly burdensome. No consensus exists on whether or to what degree mortgage rules have unduly restricted the availability of mortgages, in part because it is difficult to isolate the effects of rules and the effects of broader economic and market forces. A variety of experts and organizations attempt to measure the availability of mortgage credit, and although their methods vary, it is generally agreed that mortgage credit is tighter than it was in the years prior to the housing bubble and subsequent housing market turmoil. However, whether this should be interpreted as a desirable correction to precrisis excesses or an unnecessary restriction on credit availability is subject to debate. If Congress finds that certain mortgage lending rules limit mortgage availability more than is justified by the realized benefits of consumer protection, it could amend certain provisions in Dodd-Frank that mandate those rules or otherwise direct regulators to relax certain rules. Some bank holding companies (BHCs) have hundreds of billions or trillions of dollars in assets and are deeply interconnected with other financial institutions. A bank may be so large that the leadership of the bank and market participants may believe that the government would save it if it became distressed. This belief could arise from the determination that the institution is so important to the country's financial system—and that its failure would be so costly to the economy and society—that the government would feel compelled to avoid that outcome. An institution of this size and complexity is said to be ""too big to fail"" (TBTF). TBTF institutions may have incentives to be excessively risky, gain unfair advantages in the market for funding, and expose taxpayers to losses. This section provides background on TBTF institutions and analyzes some prominent issues related to them, including enhanced prudential regulation for large banks, including enhanced cap i tal requirements , liquidity requirements , living wills , and stress-testing ; and measures taken to reduce market expectation of government support for failing institutions, such as the Orderly Liquidation Authority (OLA). Several market forces likely drive banks and other financial institutions to grow in size and complexity, thereby potentially increasing efficiency and improving financial and economic outcomes. For example, marginal costs can be reduced through economies of scale; consumers could be offered convenient ""one-stop shopping"" for a variety of financial products and services; and bank risk can be diversified by spreading exposures over multiple business lines and geographic markets. These market forces—along with the relaxation of certain regulations—likely drove some banks to become very large and complex in the years preceding the crisis. At the end of 1997, two insured depository institutions held more than $250 billion in assets, and together accounted for about 9.3% of total industry assets. By the end of 2007, six banks held 40.9% of industry assets. The trend has generally continued, and at the end of 2016, nine banks held more than $250 billion in assets, accounting for 50.3% of industry assets. However, many observers assert that when a financial institution exceeds a certain size, complexity, or interconnectedness, the institution—as well as its creditors and investors—may be incented to take on excessive risk. Companies in a market economy are generally restrained in their risk-taking by market discipline —market forces create incentives to carefully assess and appropriately manage potential losses. Shareholders and creditors want the likelihood of loss to be appropriately balanced with potential returns. However, banks of a certain size or complexity may create moral hazard —a situation in which a person or company is willing to take on outsized risks, because it believes it can profit from the potential gains while being protected from the potential losses. In the case of large banks, this perceived protection against loss comes from a belief that a large bank will receive government support in the event it becomes distressed. Very large institutions may be deeply interconnected with other financial institutions, and stress at one institution could quickly spread throughout the financial system. The resultant contagion effects could potentially cause devastating economic and social outcomes. If a TBTF bank believed government would intervene in such an event, the TBTF bank may take on excessive risks. Also, a TBTF institution could enjoy lower funding costs than competitors, as investors and creditors also may have expectations of government support for the institution. Many assert that certain events of the financial crisis of 2008-2009 were a demonstration of TBTF-related problems. Large institutions had taken on large risks, and when they resulted in large losses, the institutions came under threat of failure. In some cases, the U.S. government took actions to stabilize the financial system and individual institutions. Large bank-related actions included capital injections to nine of the largest banks conducted by the Treasury under the Troubled Asset Relief Program, and the government-assisted acquisition of Wachovia by Wells Fargo. In general, two approaches have been used through Dodd-Frank provisions and the Basel III Accords to reduce or eliminate the problem of TBTF. One is to reduce potentially excessive risk-taking at large, complex, and interconnected financial institutions—including banks—through enhanced prudential regulation . Another is to reduce the need for and market expectations of government support in the event such an institution were failing. Aspects of both of these measures are subject to policy debate. Enhanced prudential regulation is intended to reduce the likelihood of large bank failure through measures that include higher capital ratios, enhanced liquidity standards, and Federal Reserve stress-testing for the nation's largest banks. As explained in the "" Regulatory Ratio Requirements "" section, capital ratios are a measure of a bank's ability to absorb losses. Generally, U.S. banks and BHCs holding more than $50 billion in assets are required to hold more capital than other banks. Enhanced liquidity standards require certain large BHCs to maintain enough liquid assets—assets that can be easily converted into cash at low cost—sufficient to cover net cash outflows that might occur during a 30-day period during a time of financial stress. Federal Reserve stress-testing involves the Federal Reserve evaluating the ability of large banks to remain adequately capitalized during hypothetical economic and financial downturns. Living will requirements involve periodically preparing resolution plans for review by the Federal Reserve and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). Enhanced prudential regulation is a rules-based approach to addressing TBTF problems. One's assessment of the efficacy and efficiency of a rules-based approach is likely to largely depend on one's assessment of whether rules-based or market-discipline-based risk assessments—to whatever degree they may or may not be distorted by TBTF incentives—can more accurately identify risk and incent firms to appropriately react to and manage those risks. Proponents of enhanced prudential regulation note that market forces failed to restrain large institutions from taking risks leading up to the financial crisis that would ultimately result in the institutions facing failure. Furthermore, proponents argue that even if market participants are better able to identify risk accurately than are regulators, market participants have a higher tolerance for risk than society as a whole because they are unlikely to internalize the systemic risks associated with a TBTF firm's failure. In addition, regulators potentially have greater access to relevant information on risk than creditors and counterparties of large, complex, and potentially opaque firms. Finally, proponents assert that the practices required by the enhanced prudential regulation are ""best practices"" that any sophisticated, well-managed bank should follow to prudently manage risk. Opponents argue that regulators are not effective in curtailing risk-taking, and point to several potential shortcomings. They cite regulator inability or unwillingness to prevent excessive risk-taking at certain firms leading up to the crisis. In addition, they argue that regulators may have adapted to weaknesses raised by the last crisis, whereas the next crisis is likely to pose a novel set of problems. Some argue that large firms are ""too complex to regulate,"" meaning regulators are incapable of identifying or understanding the risks inherent in complicated transactions and corporate structures. This has implications for whether simple or complex rules would be more effective. One response to addressing this complexity is to make the regulatory regime more sophisticated, but some critics argue that this approach is likely to backfire and simple regulations are more likely to be robust. Others have argued that large firms are ""too big to jail,"" meaning regulators cannot take effective supervisory actions against firms if those actions would undermine the firm's financial health, and thus its financial stability. Furthermore, critics argue that creating a special prudential regulatory regime is counterproductive. They contend that placing a bank in the regime is signaling to market participants that the bank has a protected status and would not be allowed to fail. Thus, the government is in effect making TBTF status explicit, which potentially exacerbates the moral hazard problem. Instead of increasing the cost of being TBTF, firms in the special regulatory regime could end up borrowing at a lower cost than other firms (because, in effect, these firms would enjoy a lower risk of default). Even if an enhanced prudential regime worked at reducing large bank risk-taking as planned, from a systemic risk perspective it could partly backfire in other ways. If financial intermediation and risky financial activities are pushed out of banks that are regulated for safety and soundness, the activity may simply migrate to more lightly regulated institutions and markets. The result could be a less regulated, less systemically stable financial system. This issue is discussed in more detail in the "" Potential Migration to Shadow Banking "" section. Enhanced prudential regulation of large banks may face similar questions concerning cost and benefit trade-offs covered in the "" Regulatory Ratio Requirements "" section: the benefits of safer banks and a more stable system may come at the cost of credit availability and economic growth. The issue is further complicated in relation to TBTF banks because if their funding costs are too low in the absence of enhanced regulation, then increasing costs for these institutions may correct a TBTF market distortion. Finally, observers debate what the appropriate thresholds that trigger enhanced regulation should be. Critics of the $50 billion asset threshold argue that many banks above that range are not systemically important. In particular, critics distinguish between regional banks (which tend to be at the lower end of the asset range and, it is claimed, have a traditional banking business model comparable to community banks) and Wall Street banks (a term applied to the largest, most complex organizations that tend to have significant nonbank financial activities). Others dispute this characterization, arguing that some regional banks are involved in sophisticated activities, such as being swap dealers, and have large off-balance-sheet exposures. If critics are correct that some banks that are currently subject to enhanced prudential regulation are not systemically important, then there may be little societal benefit from subjecting them to enhanced regulation, making that regulation unduly burdensome to them. Opponents of enhanced prudential regulation for large banks offer a variety of alternative policy approaches. Congress could create exemptions from certain enhanced prudential regulations to reduce regulatory burden and increase reliance on market discipline. Some have proposed breaking up big banks, either by establishing asset limits or imposing capital requirements so stringent on banks that reach a certain size that they would have a strong incentive to break up into separate businesses. Another proposed alternative is to impose restrictions on mixing commercial banking and certain investment activities—perhaps similar to those previously required under the Glass-Steagall Act—and so limit how complex an institution can become. Other proposals are based on the assessment that the enhanced regulation is not problematic per se; rather, that it has been applied too broadly and includes institutions that are not large or complex enough to be considered TBTF. If so, Congress could raise the threshold above $50 billion or switch to a designation process in which banks of a certain size had an opportunity to be assessed more on a case-by-case basis. In addition, some think the regulations as currently formulated are more burdensome than is necessary, in which case Congress could alter certain regulations to provide regulatory relief, such as by reducing the frequency with which banks are subject to stress tests or must submit living wills—plans to resolve the bank—to the Federal Reserve. The TBTF problem can also be addressed by credibly reducing or eliminating the possibility that government will save a failing institution, and ensuring that losses resulting from a failure would be borne by shareholders and creditors. Other industries generally resolve failing firms through bankruptcy. However, some observers assert that part of what makes some financial firms too big to fail is that the bankruptcy process is not amenable to resolving a large financial institution without disrupting the financial system. They argue a firm that dominates important financial market segments cannot be liquidated without disrupting the availability of credit, and the deliberate pace of the bankruptcy process is not equipped to avoid the runs and contagion inherent in the failure of a financial firm. Also, the effects on systemic risk are not taken into account when decisions are made in the bankruptcy process. Government commitments to let financial firms fail may not be credible if that failure is likely to be disruptive and destabilizing to the financial system and the economy. Another Dodd-Frank reform was the creation of an alternative resolution regime for certain financial firms outside of bankruptcy. An example of such a regime existed prior to the crisis in which the FDIC had the authority to resolve deposit-taking institutions that failed. However, the pre-Dodd-Frank Act authority may not be sufficient to resolve very large banking organizations due to their complex nature. Many of the largest financial institutions are organized as bank-holding companies (BHCs)—parent companies that own many (sometimes thousands) of subsidiary companies that include at least one deposit-taking commercial bank as well as other subsidiaries, such as broker-dealers, asset managers, and investment advisors. A BHC could possibly become distressed at the holding-company level, or distress at a nondeposit-taking subsidiary could spread to the holding-company level. In these cases, it is not clear if the authority to resolve deposit-taking subsidiaries could prevent a chaotic, disruptive failure with systemic implications. The Orderly Liquidation Authority (OLA) created by the Dodd-Frank Act gives the FDIC authority to resolve large BHCs, as well as certain nonbank financial institutions. Proponents argue that such a resolution regime offers an alternative to propping up a failing BHC with government assistance or suffering the systemic consequences of a protracted and messy bankruptcy. They point to the similarities between the OLA and the FDIC's resolution regime, and note the successes of the FDIC's resolution process of large depositories—such as Wachovia and Washington Mutual—during the crisis. Those failures arguably were less disruptive to the financial system than the failure of Lehman Brothers—a nondepository that went through the bankruptcy process—even though Wachovia and Lehman Brothers were similar in size. Neither FDIC resolution involved government assistance. Losses were imposed on stockholders and unsecured creditors in the resolution of Washington Mutual. In the case of Wachovia, the FDIC arranged for Wells Fargo to acquire the failing bank. Critics argue that the resolution of a depository—even a large one—is substantially different from the resolution of a very large, very complex BHC and its affiliated subsidiaries, and voice doubts that the OLA could be used to smoothly resolve such an institution. In addition, critics assert that the OLA gives policymakers too much discretionary power, which could result in higher costs to the government and preferential treatment of favored creditors during the resolution. In other words, it could enable ""backdoor bailouts"" that could allow government assistance to be funneled to the firm or its creditors beyond what would be available in bankruptcy, perpetuating the moral hazard problem. The normal FDIC resolution regime minimizes the potential for these problems through statutory requirements of least-cost resolution and prompt corrective action, but some expect that a resolution regime for TBTF firms would at times be required to subordinate a least-cost principle to systemic risk considerations. Therefore, a resolution could be more beneficial to creditors than the bankruptcy process. As an alternative to a special resolution regime, some observers call for amending the bankruptcy code to create a special chapter for complex financial firms to address problems that have been identified, such as a speedier process and the ability to reorganize. To some extent, these concerns are addressed in the bankruptcy code. But unlike Title II, the bankruptcy process cannot—for better or worse—base decisions on financial stability concerns or ensure that a financial firm has access to the significant sources of liquidity it needs. Until a TBTF firm fails, it is an open question as to whether a special resolution regime could successfully achieve what it is intended to do—shut down a failing firm without triggering systemic disruption or exposing taxpayers to losses. Given the size of the firms involved and the unanticipated transmission of systemic risk, it is not clear if the government could impose losses on creditors via OLA without triggering contagion. Acting as receiver in a future failure, the FDIC could face the same short-term incentives to limit creditor losses in order to contain systemic risk that caused policymakers to rescue firms in the recent crisis. If those short-term incentives spur the receiver to avoid creditor losses, the only difference between a resolution regime and a ""bailout"" might be that shareholder equity is wiped out, which may not generate enough savings to avoid costs to the government. The Federal Reserve imposes a ""total loss absorbing capacity"" (TLAC) requirement—a minimum level of capital and long-term debt—on certain large banks in part to create the expectation that shareholders and creditors will bear the losses in a failure. In addition, a mandatory funding mechanism exists in Title II to recoup losses to taxpayers. However, because that mechanism is not ""prefunded,"" there could be at least temporary taxpayer losses. Opponents to the OLA assert that large BHCs should be resolved through bankruptcies to instill market discipline in TBTF banks and protect the taxpayers from potential losses, especially if weaknesses related to large BHCs in the bankruptcy process are addressed. If Congress decides to take this approach, it could repeal the FDIC's OLA authorities and amend the Bankruptcy Code. While some banks hold a very large amount of assets, are complex, and operate on a national or international scale, the vast majority of U.S. banks are relatively small, have simple business models, and operate within a local area. This section provides background on these smaller, simpler banks—often called community bank s —and analyzes issues related to them, including regulatory relief for community banks, and the long-term decline in the number of community banks. Banks are often classified as community banks based on their total asset size—the value of the loans, securities, and other assets they hold. However, many have observed that most small banks are generally different from large banks in a variety of ways besides asset size. Smaller institutions often are more concentrated in core bank businesses of making loans and taking deposits and less involved in other, more complex activities and products more typically performed by large banks. Small banks also tend to operate within a smaller geographic area. In addition, small banks are generally more likely to practice relationship lending wherein loan officers and other bank employees have a longer-standing and perhaps more personal relationship with borrowers. Due in part to these characteristics, proponents of community banks assert that these banks are particularly important credit sources to local communities and otherwise underserved groups, as big banks may be unwilling to fulfill the credit needs of a small market of which they have little knowledge. Finally, relative to large banks, small banks are likely to have fewer employees, to have less resources to dedicate to regulatory compliance, and to individually pose less of a systemic risk to the broader financial system. There is no standard, commonly accepted definition or asset size threshold of what constitutes a small bank or a community bank. Statutes and regulations identify exempted banks by various asset size thresholds, such as those with under $10 billion or $50 billion in assets. The Federal Reserve defines community banks as those banks with less than $10 billion in assets. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) defines community banks as generally having $1 billion or less in assets. Others define community banks by combining size with a focus on relationship-based services, such as lending, with the local community. The FDIC has a research definition of community banking organizations, which it defines as (1) banks with less than $1 billion in assets as long as the bank makes loans and takes deposits, does not hold a large share of foreign assets, and is not a specialty bank; or (2) banks with more than $1 billion in assets that meet certain criteria, such as having more than one-third of their assets in loans, core deposits equal to at least half of their assets, and a limited geographic presence. By this definition, not all community banks are small banks, although the two are closely related. Because there is no widely accepted definition, this report uses the terms ""small bank"" and ""community bank"" interchangeably, generally referring to relatively small banks focused on serving the credit needs of people and businesses within a particular area using simple financial products. A central question about the regulation of banks in general is whether an appropriate trade-off has been struck between the benefits and costs of regulation. The costs associated with government regulation and its implementation are referred to as regulatory burden . A regulation could be a net positive for society if the benefits of the regulation exceed the cost. In contrast, regulation could be a net negative if costs exceed benefits—sometimes referred to as unduly burdensome regulation. Critics of recent regulation assert that when applied to community banks, certain realized benefits (such as increased systemic stability) are likely to be relatively small, whereas certain realized costs (such as compliance expenses for banks with limited resources and reduced credit for certain communities) are likely to be relatively large. Other observers assert that the regulatory burden facing small banks is appropriate, and note that small banks are given special regulatory consideration to minimize their regulatory burden. Many regulations, including some regulations resulting from Dodd-Frank, include an exemption for small banks or are tailored to reduce the cost for small banks to comply. In addition, during the rulemaking process, bank regulators are required to consider the effect of rules on small banks under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) of 1980 ( P.L. 96-354 ) and the Riegle Community Development and Regulatory Improvement Act ( P.L. 103-325 ). Supervision is also structured to pose less of a burden on small banks than larger banks, such as by requiring less-frequent bank examinations for certain small banks. One argument for easing the regulatory burden for community banks is that regulation intended to increase systemic stability need not be applied to community banks. Due to the role of large institutions in the crisis, policymakers have been particularly focused on the systemic risk posed by large banks and ensuring that they are not ""too big to fail."" As previously noted, the Dodd-Frank Act attempted to address this problem by imposing heightened prudential regulatory standards on the largest banks relative to small and medium-sized banks. Sometimes the argument is extended to assert that because small banks did not cause the crisis and pose less systemic risk, they need not be subject to new regulations. Opponents of these arguments note that systemic risk is only one of the goals of regulation, along with prudential regulation and consumer protection. They contend that precrisis prudential regulation for small banks was not stringent enough, as hundreds of small banks failed during and after the crisis. Another potential rationale for easing regulations on small banks would be if there are economies of scale to regulatory compliance costs. While regulatory compliance costs are likely to rise with size, those costs as a percentage of overall costs or revenues are likely to fall. In particular, as regulatory complexity increases, compliance may become relatively more costly for small firms. To give a simplified example, imagine a bank with $100 million in assets and 25 employees and a bank with $10 billion in assets and 1,250 employees each determine they must hire an extra employee to ensure compliance with new regulations. The relative burden is larger on the small institution that expands its workforce by 4% than on the large bank that expands by less than 0.1%. From a cost-benefit perspective, if regulatory compliance costs are subject to economies of scale, then the balance of costs and benefits of a particular regulation will differ depending on the size of the bank. For the same regulatory proposal, economies of scale could potentially result in costs outweighing benefits for smaller banks. Empirical evidence on whether compliance costs are subject to economies of scale is mixed. Some argue for reducing the regulatory burden on small banks on the grounds that they provide greater access to credit or offer credit at lower prices than large banks for certain groups of borrowers. These arguments tend to emphasize potential market niches small banks occupy that larger banks may be unwilling to fill, such as low-income or rural communities and other underserved markets. Empirical evidence is also mixed. Data that support these arguments include the fact that community banks held 71% of total deposits in rural counties in 2011, compared with 19% of overall deposits nationwide. Similarly, it is argued that small banks are better situated to engage in types of transactions that depend on ""relationship banking"" (i.e., personalized knowledge of risks), and that rigid regulations with standardized criteria are not well suited for the relationship banking model. Due to a lack of a clear, consensus definition, setting exemption thresholds and criteria is an issue of calibration. Should they be set so that regulations apply only to the very largest, most complex banks, as well as internationally active banks with substantial nonbank subsidiaries? Should the thresholds be set relatively low, so that only very small banks are exempt? Often at issue in this debate are the so-called regional banks —banks that are larger and operate across a greater geographic market than the community banks that have less than $10 billion or $1 billion in assets, but also smaller and less complex than the largest, most complex organizations with hundreds of billions or trillions of dollars in assets. If Congress decides that additional regulatory relief should be provided for small banks, it could continue to be provided under the current system of ad hoc exemptions. As new laws and regulations are adopted, policymakers can decide to use size-based exemptions or tailoring more often and at higher size thresholds. In addition, exemptions can be retroactively added, or thresholds of existing exemptions could be raised. An alternative to the current system would be a single, consistent exemption based on size or other criteria set by statute. Another would be setting criteria that automatically exempt certain institutions, and granting regulators discretion to exempt any other institutions they deem appropriate. Small banks, under almost any common definition, have seen their numbers decline and their collective share of banking industry assets fall in the United States in recent decades. Overall, the number of FDIC-insured institutions fell from a peak of 18,083 in the first quarter of 1986 to 5,913 in 2016. The number of institutions with less than $1 billion in assets fell from 18,045 to 5,799 in that time period, and the share of industry assets held by those banks fell from 72% to 18%. Meanwhile, the number of banks with more than $10 billion in assets rose from 36 to 114 from 1986 to 2016, and the share of total banking industry assets held by those banks increased from 28% to 82%. The decrease in the number of banks occurred through three main methods. Most of the decline in the number of institutions in the last 30 years was due to mergers, which averaged over 400 a year from 1990 to 2016. Failures were minimal from 1999 to 2007, but played a larger role in the decline during the financial crisis and recession. As economic conditions have improved more recently, failures have declined, but the number of n ew r eporters —new chartered institutions providing information to the FDIC for the first time—has been extraordinarily small in recent years and was zero in 2016. Observers have cited several possible causes for this industry consolidation. As covered in more detail in the previous section, "" Regulatory Burden on Community Banks ,"" some argue it indicates that the regulatory burden on small banks is too onerous, driving smaller banks to merge to create or join larger institutions. However, mergers—the largest factor in consolidation—could occur for a variety of reasons. For example, a bank that is struggling financially may look to merge with a stronger bank in order to stay in business. Alternatively, a small bank that has been outperforming its peers may be bought by a larger bank that wants to benefit from its success. In addition, other fundamental changes besides regulatory burden in the banking system could be driving consolidation, making it difficult to isolate the effects of regulation. Through much of the 20 th century, federal and state laws restricted banks' ability to open new branches and banking across state lines was restricted; branching and banking across state lines was not substantially deregulated at the federal level until 1997 through the Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking and Branching Efficiency Act of 1994 ( P.L. 103-328 ). These restrictions meant many individual, small banks were needed to serve every community. When these restrictions were relaxed, it became easier for small banks to consolidate or for mid-size and large banks to spread operations to other markets. In addition, there may be economies of scale (cost advantages due to size or volume of output) to banking, and they may be growing over time, which would also drive industry consolidation. For example, information technology has become more important in banking (e.g., cybersecurity and mobile banking), and certain information technology systems may be subject to economies of scale. Finally, the slow growth coming out of the most recent recession, and macroeconomic conditions more generally (such as low interest rates), may make it less appealing for new firms to enter the banking market. To the degree that regulatory burden is causing consolidation in the bank industry, regulatory relief for community bank policies such as those discussed in "" Legislative Alternatives "" found in the section above could potentially address the decline in the number of community banks. Financial regulatory agencies are invested with the authority to regulate, and most of them are referred to as independent regulatory agencies , allowing them to operate with a relatively high degree of independence from the President and Congress. This raises the issue of how they should be held accountable for the regulations they implement and the actions they take. This section provides background on the issue of agency independence and issues related to creating an appropriate degree of accountability, including whether the agency is self-funding or funded through appropriations; whether the agency is led by an individual or a bipartisan commission; what regulatory analysis requirements the agency faces in the rulemaking process; and to what extent agency rulemaking is subject to congressional review. Financial regulators conduct rulemaking, supervision, and enforcement to implement law and supervise financial institutions. A list of federal financial regulators is provided in Table 1 . These agencies—along with certain other regulatory agencies—have been given certain characteristics that generally make them more independent from the President and Congress than most executive agencies. Their independence results from characteristics including their leadership structure, ability to self-fund outside the appropriations process, and rulemaking requirements. While this independence allows technical rules to be designed by experts who are to some degree insulated from political considerations, it also results in rules being implemented by individuals who arguably are not directly accountable to the electorate. Whether an appropriate balance between independence and accountability of these agencies has been achieved is a matter of debate. Some observers argue that better regulatory outcomes would be achieved if agencies were more accountable. Others feel that independence is necessary for agencies to effectively regulate and should not be reduced. Self-funding is one characteristic that provides certain financial regulators with a relatively high degree of independence. The annual appropriations process and periodic reauthorization legislation provide Congress with opportunities to influence the size, scope, priorities, and activities of an agency. However, most federal bank regulators generate income from other sources, such as the collection of fees or assessments from the entities that they oversee, and are not subject to the appropriations process. Those who believe financial regulator independence has become excessive often assert that ending self-funding and bringing financial regulators into the appropriations and authorization processes would result in a more appropriate level of accountability. Doing so would provide Congress with regular opportunities to evaluate an agency's performance. During these processes, Congress also might influence the activities of these agencies by legislating provisions that reallocate resources or place limitations on the use of appropriated funds to better reflect congressional priorities. Through line-item funding, bill text, or accompanying committee report text, Congress could encourage, discourage, require, or forbid specific activities at the agency, including rulemaking. Alternatively, Congress could adjust an agency's overall funding level if Congress is supportive or unsupportive of the agency's mission or conduct. Thus, congressional control over an agency's funding reduces its independence from (and increases its accountability to) Congress. However, opponents argue that reduced independence would produce worse regulatory outcomes, because—as mentioned previously—it may politicize regulators' policymaking at the expense of allowing experts to write technical rules. Congress could end financial regulatory agency self-funding or bring the regulators into the appropriations and authorization processes if it seeks to reduce agency independence and increase accountability to Congress. Each bank regulatory agency was created at a different time and in a different policy context, and so each agency's leadership has different structural features, as shown in Table 2 . Currently, some regulatory agencies are led by a single leader and some are led by multimember boards. In each case where there is a board structure, the board has a chairman, whose powers vis-à-vis other members vary by agency. Different arguments are made in favor of which leadership structure would be most appropriate for the various agencies. Vesting power in a board arguably encourages a diversity of views to be represented, which may lead to more durable policy decisions. On the other hand, vesting power in one individual arguably could create stronger, more unified leadership and a single point of accountability, perhaps leading to faster and more numerous decisions. Different leadership structures also raise issues related to the independence versus accountability trade-off. Where an agency is headed by a single individual, the appointee's views are more likely to reflect the views of the appointing President and his or her party; the leadership is unitary and no consensus is necessary. In contrast, the collegial structure is thought to increase the independence of an agency from the President. Therefore, observers who believe agencies should have more independence from the President are often proponents of replacing the leadership structure at agencies headed by a director with multimember commissions. Other characteristics of leadership positions may enhance independence from Congress and the President. For example, independence is thought to increase when leadership term length exceeds the length of a presidential term and is staggered and nonrenewable; when nominees are required to have issue expertise; and when agency heads can be removed only ""for cause."" The leadership of financial regulatory agencies generally has such features, although notably the Comptroller of the Currency does not have ""for cause"" removal protections. Congress could change financial regulatory agencies' structures in various ways to alter the balance between agency independence and accountability. For example, Congress could make agencies headed by a director more accountable by eliminating ""for cause"" removal protections or replacing the director with a multimember board or commission. One method of maintaining accountability is statutorily requiring agencies to perform a cost-benefit analysis (CBA) —a systematic examination, estimation, and comparison of the economic costs and benefits potentially resulting from the implementation of a proposed new rule—as part of the rulemaking process. In this way, the agency demonstrates that it has given reasoned consideration to the necessity and efficacy of a rule and the effects it will have on society. However, a fully quantified and monetized analysis with results that have a high degree of precision is not always feasible. Predicting future outcomes requires making assumptions that are subject to a degree of uncertainty. Accounting for human behavioral responses to a regulation poses challenges. Some effects are difficult to quantify and monetize. Relevant data are not always available and accurate. This raises questions about the appropriate scope, level of detail, and degree of quantification that should be required of analyses performed in the rulemaking process. Overly lenient requirements could risk overly burdensome regulation with limited benefit being implemented by an unaccountable agency without due consideration of consequences. On the other hand, overly onerous analytic requirements could risk impeding the implementation of necessary, beneficial regulation because performing the analysis would be too time-consuming, too costly, or simply not possible. Debate over appropriate CBA requirements for financial regulators involves an additional complication. Currently, most financial regulators, as independent regulatory agencies, are not subject to certain executive orders, such as E.O. 12866, which directs the CBA performed by most executive departments and agencies. This exemption generally gives financial regulators a relatively high degree of discretion in the parameters of the CBAs they perform. However, experts disagree over whether greater discretion for financial regulators is appropriate. Some observers assert financial regulators should not be subject to a rigid legal structure when performing CBA. They claim that attempts to quantify the effects of financial regulation are imprecise and unreliable. These attempts entail making causal assumptions that are contestable and uncertain, and often face issues concerning data availability and accuracy. Also, financial regulation intends to induce behavioral, microeconomic, and macroeconomic responses, and these effects may be harder to quantify than regulations in other industries that lead to more measurable effects. Others assert that financial regulators should be subject to stricter CBA requirements than they are now. They argue that requisite, quantitative CBA—when it might yield a wide range of estimates or disagreements over accuracy between technical experts—is necessary because it disciplines agencies in regard to what rules they implement, and allows for an objective assessment of whether a regulation is likely to achieve its goals and at what cost. Some claim that the challenges of performing CBA for financial regulations are not greater than for regulations for other industries, arguing that estimations of benefits and costs—although challenging—are possible. Congress has several alternatives available if it decided to change CBA requirements for financial regulators. Congress could require that certain effects—such as those on financial product cost or national employment—be examined as part of the analyses. Similarly, Congress could require a certain degree of quantification be part of the analysis. In addition, certain findings in these CBAs could trigger a requirement to get a waiver from Congress before the rule can go forward. Another alternative would be to authorize the President to extend executive orders related to CBA to independent regulatory agencies, including subjecting the CBAs to review by the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs. The Congressional Review Act (CRA) provides a mechanism to increase banking regulatory agencies' accountability. CRA is an oversight tool that Congress can use to invalidate a final rule issued by a federal agency. It was enacted in response to concerns expressed by Members of both parties about Congress's ability to control what many viewed as a rapidly growing body of administrative rules. Many felt that as Congress delegated more power to agencies to implement law, the traditional oversight tools Congress possessed were not adequate. The CRA requires agencies to report to Congress on their rulemaking activities and provides Congress with a special set of expedited parliamentary procedures that can be used to consider legislation striking down agency rules it opposes. These ""fast track"" parliamentary procedures, which are available primarily in the Senate, limit debate and amendment on a joint resolution disapproving a rule and ensure that a simple majority can reach a final up-or-down vote on the measure. Members of Congress have specified time periods in which to submit and act on a joint resolution of disapproval invalidating the rule. If both houses agree to such a joint resolution, it is sent to the President for his signature or veto. If a CRA joint resolution of disapproval is enacted, either by being signed by the President or by being enacted over his veto, the agency final rule in question ""shall not take effect (or continue)."" The act also provides that if a joint resolution of disapproval is enacted, a new rule may not be issued in ""substantially the same form"" as the disapproved rule unless the rule is specifically authorized by a subsequent law. The CRA prohibits judicial review of any ""determination, finding, action, or omission under"" the act. Observers have argued that the structure of the CRA disapproval process often renders the CRA largely unworkable as an oversight mechanism. A President is most likely to veto a joint resolution that attempts to strike down a final rule proposed by his or her own Administration or by a like-minded independent agency, and a supermajority is necessary to override a presidential veto—something that has been historically rare. Therefor e, Congress typically has the opportunity to successfully block rules from taking effect only in period s between the start of a new Admin i stration —and only when the new Administration's regulatory policy positions are more aligned with those of the sitting Congress than those of the previous A dministration—and the expiration of the specified time period Congress has to act on a CRA resolution. The beginning of the 115 th Congress generally meets those criteria, and 14 disapproval resolutions had been enacted as of May 18th, 2017, but only one disapproval resolution had been enacted in the preceding 20 years. If Congress decided to alter the CRA disapproval mechanism, it could change it from a resolution of disapproval to a resolution of approval . Such a change would mean that instead of rules automatically going into force unless Congress enacted a measure stopping them, some or all rules would become effective only upon the enactment of a law approving them. This mechanism would increase congressional oversight of which regulations would go into effect, but may politicize or unduly slow the promulgation of technical rules that would, on net, benefit society. In addition to issues related to regulation, banking is also continually affected by market and economic conditions and trends. This section analyzes certain issues related to trends that may concern banks, including migration of financial activity from banks into nonbanks or the ""shadow banking"" system; increasing capabilities and market presence of financial technology (""fintech""); increasing interest rates in the future; and competitive and regulatory issues related to institutions with different charters but similar business models—such as banks, thrifts, and credit unions. Because these issues involve the interactions between several broad market forces, specific legislative alternatives will not be examined in this section. Credit intermediation is a core banking activity and involves transforming short-term, liquid, safe liabilities into relatively long-term, illiquid, higher-risk assets. In the context of traditional banking, credit intermediation is done by taking deposits from savers and using them to fund loans to borrowers. Because bank assets are illiquid, an otherwise-solvent bank might experience difficulty meeting short-term obligations without having to sell assets, possibly at ""fire sale"" prices. Also, if depositors begin to feel their deposits are not safe, many of them may choose to withdraw their funds at the same time. Such a ""run"" on a bank could cause it to fail. Long-established government programs mitigate liquidity- and run-risk. The Federal Reserve is authorized to act as a ""lender of last resort"" for a bank experiencing liquidity problems, and the FDIC insures depositors against losses. Banks are also subject to prudential regulation—as discussed in the "" Prudential Regulation "" section—to ensure that risks are well managed and kept at reasonable levels. However, certain financial markets and instruments allow nonbank institutions to also perform similar credit intermediation to banks. Some observers are concerned that this nonbank credit intermediation—sometimes called shadow banking —poses significant risks, because it can be performed without the government ""safety nets"" available to banks or the prudential regulation required of them. The lack of an explicit government safety net in shadow banking means that taxpayers are less explicitly or directly exposed to risk, but also means that shadow banking may be more vulnerable to a panic that could trigger a financial crisis. Furthermore, some argue that the increased regulatory burden placed on banks in response to the financial crisis—such as the changes in bank regulation mandated by Dodd-Frank or agreed to in Basel III—could result in a decreasing role for banks in credit intermediation and an increased role for relatively lightly regulated nonbanks. Many contend the financial crisis demonstrated how these risks in the shadow banking sector can create or exacerbate systemic distress. Money market mutual funds are deposit-like instruments that are managed with the goal of never losing principal and that investors can convert to cash on demand. Institutions can also access deposit-like funding by borrowing through short-term funding markets—such as by issuing commercial paper and entering repurchase agreements. These instruments can be continually rolled over as long as funding providers have confidence in the solvency of the borrowers. During the crisis, all these instruments—which investors had previously viewed as safe and unlikely to suffer losses—experienced run-like events as funding providers withdrew from markets. Also, nonbanks can take on exposure to long-term loans through investing in mortgage-backed securities (MBS) or other asset-backed securities (ABS). During the crisis as firms faced liquidity problems, the value of these assets decreased quickly, possibly in part as a result of fire sales. Since the crisis, many regulatory changes have been made related to certain money market, commercial paper, and repurchase agreement markets and practices. However, some observers are still concerned that shadow banking poses risks. Furthermore, because banks now face more stringent prudential regulation, certain credit intermediation activities may ""migrate"" to nonbanks and the shadow banking system, where institutions are less burdened by regulation. Fintech usually refers to technologies with the potential to alter the way certain financial services are performed. Banks are affected by technological developments in two ways: (1) they face choices over how much to invest in emerging technologies and to what extent they want to alter their business models in adopting technologies, and (2) they potentially face new competition from new technology-focused companies. Such technologies include online marketplace lending, crowdfunding, blockchain and distributed ledgers, and robo-advising, among many others. Certain financial innovations may create opportunities to improve social and economic outcomes, but there is also potential to create risks or unexpected financial losses. Potential benefits from fintech are greater efficiency in financial markets that creates lower prices and increased customer and small business access to financial services. These can be achieved as innovative technology replaces traditional processes that have become outdated. For example, automation may be able to replace employees, and digital technology can replace physical systems and infrastructure. Cost savings from removing inefficiencies may lead to reduced prices, making certain services affordable to new customers. Some customers that previously did not have access to services—due to such things as lack of information about creditworthiness, or geographic remoteness—could also potentially gain access. Increased accessibility may be especially beneficial to traditionally underserved groups, such as low-income, minority, and rural populations. Fintech could also create or increase risks. Many fintech products have only a brief history of operation, so it can be difficult to predict outcomes and assess risk. It is possible certain technologies may not in the end function as efficiently and accurately as intended. Also, the stated aim of a new technology is often to bring a product directly to consumers and eliminate a ""middle-man."" However, that middle-man could be an experienced financial institution or professional that can advise consumers on financial products and their risks. In these ways, fintech could increase the likelihood that consumers engage in a financial activity and take on risks that they do not fully understand. Certain innovations can likely be integrated into the financial system with little regulatory or policy action. Technology in finance largely involves reducing the cost of producing existing products and services, and the existing regulatory structure was developed to address risks from these financial activities. Existing regulation may be able to accommodate new technologies while adequately protecting against risks. However, there are two other possibilities. One is that some regulations may be stifling beneficial innovation. Another is that existing regulation does not adequately address risks created by new technologies. Some observers argue that regulation could potentially impede the development and introduction of beneficial innovation. Companies incur costs to comply with regulations. In addition, companies are sometimes unsure how regulators will treat the innovation once it is brought to market. A potential solution being used in other countries is to establish a regulatory ""sandbox"" or ""greenhouse"" wherein companies that meet certain requirements work with regulators as products are brought to market. Some are concerned that existing regulations may not adequately address certain risks posed by new technologies. Regulatory arbitrage—conducting business in a way that circumvents unfavorable regulations—may be a concern in this area. Fintech potentially could provide an opportunity for companies to claim they are not subject to certain regulations because of a superficial difference between how they operate compared to traditional companies. Another group of issues posed by fintech relates to cybersecurity. As activity increasingly utilizes digital technology, sensitive data are generated. Data can be used to accurately assess risks and ensure customers receive the best products and services. However, data can be stolen and used inappropriately, and there are concerns over privacy issues. This raises questions over ownership and control of the data—including the rights of consumers and the responsibilities of companies in accessing and using data—and whether companies that use and collect data face appropriate cybersecurity requirements. The Federal Reserve's monetary policy response to the financial crisis, the ensuing recession, and subsequent slow economic growth was to keep interest rates unusually low for an extraordinarily long time. It accomplished this in part using unprecedented monetary policy tools such as quantitative easing —large-scale asset purchases that significantly increased the size of the Federal Reserve's balance sheet. Recently, as economic conditions have improved, the Federal Reserve has begun to raise its target rate, and increased attention has been given to how and when the Federal Reserve will normalize monetary policy. A rising interest rate environment—especially following an extended period of unusually low rates achieved with unprecedented monetary policy tools—is an issue for banks because they are exposed to interest rate risk . A portion of bank assets have fixed interest rates with long terms until maturity, such as mortgages, and the rates of return on these assets do not increase as current market rates do. However, many bank liabilities are short-term, such as deposits, and can be repriced quickly. So although certain interest revenue being collected by banks is slow to rise, the interest costs paid out by banks can rise quickly. In addition to putting stress on net income, rising interest rates can cause the market value of fixed-rate assets to fall. Finally, banks incur an opportunity cost when resources are tied up in long-term assets with low interest rates rather than being used to make new loans at higher interest rates. The magnitude of interest rate risks should not be overstated, as rising rates can increase bank profitability if they result in a greater difference between long-term rates banks receive and short-term rates they pay—referred to as net interest margin . Nonetheless, banks and regulators recognize the importance of managing interest rate risk, carefully examine the composition of bank balance sheets, and plan for different interest rate change scenarios. While banks are well practiced at interest rate risk management through normal economic and monetary policy cycles, managing bank risk through the next period of interest rate growth could be more challenging because rates have been so low for so long and achieved through unprecedented monetary policy tools. Because rates have been low for so long, many loans made in different interest rate environments that preceded the crisis have matured. Meanwhile, all new loans made in the last eight years have been made in a low interest rate environment. This presents challenges to getting a mix of loans with different rates. In addition, because the Federal Reserve has used new monetary policy tools and grown its balance sheet to unprecedented levels, accurately controlling the pace of interest rate growth may be challenging. An institution that makes loans and takes deposits—the core activities of traditional commercial banking—can have one of several types of charters, including a national bank charter, a state bank charter, a federal savings association (also called a ""thrift"") charter, or a credit union charter. Each charter type determines what activities are permissible for the institution, what activities are restricted, and which agency will be the institution's primary regulator (see Table 3 ). A rationale for this system is that it gives institutions with different business models and ownership arrangements the ability to choose a regulatory regime appropriately suited to the institution's business needs and risks. The differences between institution business models and the attendant regulations are numerous, varied, and beyond the scope of this report. This examination of the issue only requires noting that (1) under each charter, an institution is subject to regulatory treatment and restrictions that differ from other charter types in certain ways and (2) these various institutions are to some degree in competition with each other for business, because although the business models may vary, all involve taking deposits and making loans. As a result, each type of institution has a stake in proposed changes to regulation related to all charter types. Institutions may assert some regulation that they are subject to puts them at a competitive disadvantage, whereas the other types of institutions oppose these assertions. Often, an effort by institutions of one type to relax their regulations will be resisted by institutions of other types. The friction between credit unions and community banks is an illustrative example. The two types of institutions are similar in certain ways—notably, they typically serve a small group of customers and engage in relationship banking, which involves familiarity with customers and local market conditions. However, there are key differences. For example, credit unions are not-for-profit cooperatives with the purpose of serving the financial needs of members. Banks provide services to the general public for profit. On the basis of the differences, regulation of credit unions and banks differs. For example, credit unions face limits on the amount of member business lending they can do, whereas banks have no equivalent limitation. Meanwhile, banks are subject to regulatory evaluation under the Community Reinvestment Act ( P.L. 95-128 ) to determine how well they are meeting the credit needs of the community in which they operate. When credit unions advocate for easing business lending restrictions, banks object, arguing that it would allow credit unions to engage in activity beyond their mandate and expand into a business line more appropriate to banks. When banks argue that the Community Reinvestment Act should be extended to other types of institutions, credit unions object, arguing they already serve the credit needs of the community. These regulatory differences between these institutions are just two of many examples of institutions with different charter types disagreeing on what appropriate regulation should be. A broader and long-standing issue underlying these debates is to what degree the government should offer different charters—with different benefits and responsibilities—for businesses that engage in similar activities and whether the difference between the charters should be narrowed. The banking regulators try to minimize their regulatory differences through joint rulemaking and coordination through the Federal Financial Institutions Examinations Council—an interagency body that prescribes uniform principles, standards, and report forms—and commercial banks and thrifts no longer have separate regulators. However, differences remain between their regulations that Congress has considered addressing. A comprehensive listing and analysis of all proposed legislation related to bank issues is beyond the scope of this report. However, such information can be found in other CRS products, including the following: CRS Report R44839, The Financial CHOICE Act in the 115th Congress: Selected Policy Issues , by [author name scrubbed] et al. This report examines H.R. 10 introduced in the 115 th Congress. H.R. 10 proposes wide-ranging changes to the financial regulatory system, and it contains provisions related to banking issues, including provisions found in Titles I, III, V, VI, VII, and IX. Many of these provisions are similar to those found in other bills. CRS Report R45073, Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act (S. 2155) and Selected Policy Issues , coordinated by [author name scrubbed]. This report examines S. 2155 , which was reported by the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs on December 18, 2017. S. 2155 proposes wide-ranging changes to the financial regulatory system, and it contains provisions related to banking issues, including provisions found in Titles I, II, and IV. Many of these provisions are similar to those found in other bills. CRS Report R44035, ""Regulatory Relief"" for Banking: Selected Legislation in the 114th Congress , coordinated by [author name scrubbed]. This report examines numerous bills related to regulatory relief for banks introduced in the 114 th Congress. CRS Report R41350, The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act: Background and Summary , coordinated by [author name scrubbed]. This report examines provisions enacted into law in the Dodd-Frank Act, and it provides background and analysis of these reforms to the financial regulatory system that are in place today. Provisions related to banking are found in Title I, II, III, VI, X, and XIV.","The financial crisis and the ensuing legislative and regulatory responses greatly affected the banking industry. Many new regulations—mandated or authorized by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (P.L. 111-203) or promulgated under the authority of bank regulators—have been implemented in recent years. In addition, economic and technological trends continue to affect banks. As a result, Congress is faced with many issues related to the bank industry, including issues concerning prudential regulation, consumer protection, ""too big to fail"" (TBTF) banks, community banks, regulatory agency design and independence, and market and economic trends. For example, the Financial CHOICE Act (H.R. 10) and the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act (S. 2155) propose wide-ranging changes to the financial regulatory system, and include provisions related to many of these banking issues. Prudential Regulation. This type of regulation is designed to ensure banks are safely profitable and unlikely to fail. Regulatory ratio requirements agreed to in the international agreement known as the Basel III Accords and the Volcker Rule are examples. Ratio requirements require banks to hold a certain amount of capital on their balance sheets to better enable them to avoid failure. The Volcker Rule prohibits certain trading activities and affiliations at banks. Proponents argue the rules appropriately balance the need for safety and soundness with regulatory burden. Opponents argue that current rules are overly complex, unduly burdensome, and difficult to enforce. Consumer Protection. Certain laws and regulations protect consumers from unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts and practices. Regulations promulgated by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) and certain mortgage lending rules are contentious issues in this area. Observers disagree over whether CFPB authorities, structure, regulations, and enforcement actions appropriately balance the benefit of protecting consumers and the potential costs of unnecessarily burdening banks and restricting credit availability. A similar debate is about whether mortgage rules appropriately protect consumers and effectively align certain market incentives or unnecessarily reduce the availability of mortgages. ""Too Big To Fail"" Banks. Regulators also regulate for systemic risks, such as those associated with TBTF financial institutions that may contribute to systemic instability. Dodd-Frank Act provisions include enhanced prudential regulation for TBTF banks and changes to resolution processes in the event one failed. Proponents of these changes assert they will eliminate or reduce excessive risk-taking at, and bailouts for, these large banks. Opponents assert that market forces and bankruptcy law are more effective and less distortionary than the new regulations and resolution authorities. Community Banks. The number of relatively small banks has declined substantially in recent decades. Some analysts assert market forces and removal of regulatory barriers to interstate branching and banking are having a large effect, given that small banks are exempt from many recent regulations and have been consolidating for decades. Others assert small institutions have limited resources and are being unnecessarily burdened by regulation, especially because such banks are unlikely to contribute to systemic risk. Regulatory Agency Design and Independence. How regulatory agencies are structured and promulgate rules are also issues. Some assert that financial agencies' relatively high degree of independence from the President and Congress results in too little accountability in rulemaking; thus, their leadership structures, funding, and rulemaking procedures should be altered. Opponents of such measures maintain that financial regulator independence should be maintained because it allows regulations to be promulgated by technical experts with some insulation from political considerations. Recent Market and Economic Trends. Changing economic forces may also pose issues to the banking industry. Increases in regulation could drive certain financial activities into a relatively lightly regulated ""shadow banking"" sector. Innovative financial technology may alter the way certain financial services are delivered. Interest rates are likely to begin rising soon after a long period of low rates, which could present risks to banks. Competition and regulatory differences between banks and nonbanks with different charter types is an ongoing issue.",govreport
"The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) is Southeast Asia's primary multilateral organization, a 10-member grouping of nations with a combined population of 580 million and an annual gross domestic product (GDP) of around $1.5 trillion. Established in 1967 to foster regional dialogue during the turbulent post-colonial, Cold War period, it has grown into one of the world's largest regional fora, representing a strategically and economically important region that spans some of the world's most critical sea lanes and accounted for around 5% of the United States' total trade in 2008. The Obama Administration is pursuing a policy of expanding and upgrading U.S. relations with Southeast Asia, and with ASEAN itself. Although the Bush Administration took steps to develop ties with the region, it was widely perceived among members of ASEAN as narrowly focused on terrorism, neglectful of other issues, and not sufficiently committed to multilateral dialogue. By contrast, the Obama Administration has explicitly expressed an intent to pay greater attention to Southeast Asia, listen more carefully to regional concerns, and work with multilateral organizations, particularly ASEAN, to cooperate on issues of mutual interest. The United States has deep-seated interests in Southeast Asia, such as maritime security, the promotion of democracy and human rights, the encouragement of liberal trade and investment regimes, counterterrorism, the combating of illegal trafficking of narcotics and human trafficking, and many others. As China has deepened its economic and cultural ties in Southeast Asia, and even taken some steps to build security ties, some analysts believe the region has also become an important site of ""soft power"" rivalry, in which the long-standing leadership role of the United States could be challenged by a rising China. Other external powers also have shown renewed or greater interest in the region, including Japan, the EU, and India. Engagement with ASEAN has presented the United States with an important foreign policy dilemma. Despite considerable U.S. security, economic, and foreign assistance initiatives in the region, particularly at the bilateral level, in recent years a perception has developed among Southeast Asian elites that the United States has placed relatively little priority on ASEAN itself and has, thereby, demonstrated a lack of commitment to Southeast Asia as a whole. Southeast Asian diplomats frequently note that other nations, including China and Japan, have given ASEAN meetings a considerably higher diplomatic commitment than has the United States. Indeed, in some ASEAN countries, one of the largest irritants to bilateral relations with the United States is the fact that it is perceived as insufficiently engaged with the multilateral body of ASEAN. The United States has long had close bilateral relations with many of Southeast Asia's nations. Two ASEAN members, Thailand and the Philippines, are U.S. treaty allies, and a third, Singapore, is a close security partner. Indonesia and Malaysia have long had strong ties with Washington, and both are seen as important models of progressive governance and economic development in majority Muslim nations. In recent years, Vietnam has also become an increasingly important voice in regional affairs, and the United States has moved to normalize and deepen ties with its one-time adversary. Some feel that these strong sets of bilateral ties are sufficient to anchor the U.S. role in the region, arguing moreover that ASEAN's consensus-based decision-making makes it difficult for the organization to accomplish much, given its broad membership, which includes highly developed financial centers, vibrant developing-nation democracies, and impoverished military dictatorships. Still, symbolic commitment is particularly important in a region that places a heavy emphasis on process and informal networking. Many observers argue that the United States needs to ""show up"" more frequently and at higher official levels, lest it lose influence in the region and risk being cut out of emerging Asian diplomatic and economic architectures. Recent actions by the Obama Administration suggest that it accepts this argument, at least on a symbolic level. The United States has been steadily expanding and deepening its relations with ASEAN since the middle of the decade. A common goal of both the Bush and the Obama Administrations appears to be to increase the multilateral dimension of U.S. policy in Southeast Asia, which traditionally has been organized along bilateral lines. However, many of the Bush Administration's initiatives—which included becoming the first country to appoint an ambassador to ASEAN, providing assistance to the ASEAN Secretariat to upgrade its capabilities, and launching the US-ASEAN Trade and Investment Framework Agreement (TIFA)—were undermined by a belief among Southeast Asian elites that the United States lacked a strong commitment to ASEAN and Southeast Asia. The piece of evidence cited most often by critics was former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice's decision to not attend two of the four ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF) Foreign Ministerial meetings during her tenure. Considerable attention was focused on President Bush's decision to cancel the scheduled US-ASEAN Summit in September 2007 to focus on the security situation in Iraq. A number of countries have regular summits with ASEAN leaders, including China, Japan, South Korea, and India. The Obama Administration has taken steps with ASEAN that some see as explicitly designed with symbolic diplomacy in mind. In February 2009, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton visited the ASEAN Secretariat in Jakarta, a first for a U.S. Secretary of State. In July 2009, during Clinton's second visit to Southeast Asia to participate in the ARF Foreign Ministerial in Thailand, the United States acceded to ASEAN's Treaty of Amity and Cooperation (TAC), which promotes the settlement of regional differences or disputes by peaceful means and is one of the organization's core documents. President Obama attended a first-ever U.S.-ASEAN leaders meeting on the sidelines of the November 2009 Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum summit in Singapore. In a joint statement, the leaders pledged continued or enhanced dialogue and cooperation in many areas, including engagement with the government of Burma (Myanmar), human rights, trade, regional security, nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament, counterterrorism, energy, climate change, educational exchanges, and support for the Lower Mekong Basin countries (Cambodia, Laos, and Vietnam). They agreed to hold a second meeting in 2010. The Obama Administration has taken other potentially noteworthy steps. Divergent U.S. and ASEAN approaches to Burma have also been an irritant to U.S.-ASEAN relations since Burma became a member of the organization in 1997. The United States has pursued a policy of diplomatically shunning the Burmese military regime and imposing stringent economic sanctions against the country—creating difficulties in engaging both politically and economically with a grouping that includes it. In the fall of 2009, the State Department announced a new Burma policy, in which the United States would hold dialogues with the Burmese leadership while still maintaining U.S. sanctions. This move, which brings Washington closer to ASEAN policy, could help to improve U.S.-ASEAN ties. Additionally, on the sidelines of the July 2009 ARF meeting, Secretary Clinton met with the foreign ministers of the lower Mekong countries, excluding Burma (i.e., Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos, and Thailand), in the first-ever U.S.-Lower Mekong Ministerial Meeting. The ministers issued a joint statement outlining the wide-ranging areas of discussion, which included responses to climate change, fighting infectious disease, and education policy. President Obama plans to visit Indonesia and Australia in March 2010. His talks with Indonesian President Yudhoyono will likely focus on trade and security ties as well as raise the profile of the region's largest and arguably most democratic nation. Taken together, the message of the Administration's symbolic and substantive moves appears to be that the United States intends to engage with ASEAN and Southeast Asian countries at a higher level, and do so more persistently. There remain questions about how far this change in approach will persist, particularly as it raises expectations in Southeast Asia. For instance, will the U.S.-ASEAN leaders' meeting be regularized, as many Southeast Asian leaders hope? On the other hand, by raising the profile of U.S.-ASEAN ties, the United States likely will place new pressures on ASEAN to increase its own utility in resolving regional crises and addressing security and economic issues in a more concerted manner, lest a more activist United States eventually bypass it. The Association of Southeast Asian Nations was founded on August 8, 1967, with the adoption of the ASEAN Declaration in Bangkok, Thailand. Originally, the association had five members—Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, and Thailand—and expanded to its current 10 members during the 1980s and 1990s with the addition of Brunei Darussalam, Vietnam, Laos, Burma, and Cambodia. Colonial experiences led to a strong desire by the original members to prevent the domination of the region by any single power. Furthermore, the formation of the organization reflected an attempt to forge independent foreign policies in the context of Cold War pressures. As stated in the ASEAN Declaration, the association was created to achieve joint goals including those related to economic growth; regional peace and security; collaboration and mutual assistance in a number of development areas; trade promotion; and linkages with other regional organizations. On February 24, 1976, ASEAN created the ASEAN Secretariat, located in Jakarta, Indonesia, an administrative body consisting of representatives of each ASEAN member nation. The Secretariat is headed by a secretary-general, who serves a term of five years. Since its creation, the structure and the duties of the Secretariat have been changed on several occasions. As of 2009, the secretary-general's main responsibilities are to organize the annual foreign ministers' meeting; initiate, advise, coordinate, and implement ASEAN activities; serve as spokesman and representative of ASEAN on all matters; and oversee the operations of the ASEAN Secretariat. ASEAN remains, to a large degree, an informal organization. The ASEAN Secretariat is lightly staffed, without the deep administrative resources and responsibilities of some multilateral organizations such as the European Union. Its current secretary-general is Surin Pitsuwan, a former Thai foreign minister, who has sought to institutionalize many of ASEAN's practices and has pushed the introduction of the ASEAN Charter. Still, much of the diplomatic activity that occurs at meetings of ASEAN leaders and senior officials occurs on the sidelines rather than at the formal level. ASEAN has traditionally operated on principles of consensus and non-interference in the internal affairs of members, which has led to considerable difficulty in the group operating in formal concert. Many analysts note that ASEAN's expansion to include underdeveloped nations such as Laos, Cambodia, and Burma has created a wide range of interests within the group that make formal security and economic moves difficult to agree upon. Although ASEAN is starting to play a more active role in dealing with its members' differences—most notably over Burma's human rights record—much of what the group does is still done through informal channels. A new ASEAN Charter went into effect on December 15, 2007, superseding the ASEAN Declaration as the organizing document for the organization. The charter is effectively a constitution for ASEAN, committing the member nations to the formation of an ""ASEAN Community in furtherance of peace, progress and prosperity of its peoples."" Some aspects of the charter may signal a greater willingness to discuss and comment on the internal affairs of the organization's members. Such a potential institutional development may help the organization to deal with members such as Burma that have caused troublesome policy issues both within the region and with ASEAN's relations with outside states. The new charter establishes a number of goals for ASEAN, including: Maintenance of peace, stability, and security in the region; Promotion of greater political, security, economic; and socio-cultural cooperation; Preservation of Southeast Asia as an area free of weapons of mass destruction, including nuclear weapons; Creation of a just, democratic, and harmonious environment in the region; Formation of a single market and production base in which there is free flow of goods, services, and investment, as well as facilitated movement of business persons, professionals, talents and labor, and the freer flow of capital; Alleviation of poverty and the narrowing of the development gap in the region; and Promotion of sustainable development so as to ensure the protection of the region's environment. According to the new charter, there are to be two ASEAN summits each year, attended by the members' heads of state or their designated representatives. In addition, the foreign ministers of the ASEAN members are to meet at least twice a year. The ASEAN Charter also creates three Community Councils, dealing with political and security, economic, and socio-cultural issues, respectively, plus preserves the institutions of the ASEAN Secretary-General and the ASEAN Secretariat as the administrative bodies for the association. Article 14 of the charter calls for the establishment of an ASEAN human rights body, a new development for ASEAN, which has traditionally refrained from commenting on the human rights situation in member nations. The first meeting of the ASEAN human rights body—formally called the ASEAN Intergovernmental Commission on Human Rights (AICHR)—took place on October 23, 2009, in Cham-Am, Thailand, following an ASEAN summit. ASEAN is at the center of several other security- and trade-related groupings in the Asia-Pacific region. The ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF), established in 1994 with 26 Asian and Pacific states plus the European Union, was formed to facilitate dialogue on political and security matters in the region. The ASEAN + 3 (China, Japan, and South Korea) was created in 1997, partly as a response to the Asian financial crisis, and partly as a way to balance the northeast Asian powers in the security dialogue process with ASEAN. Created in 2005, the East Asia Summit (EAS) which, in addition to the ASEAN + 3 members, includes Australia, New Zealand, and India, represented an effort by some countries in the region, particularly Japan, to balance China's influence in the region through the inclusion of additional, non-East Asian powers. More recently, the geopolitical discussion in Asia has turned to the issue of the formation of an EU-style association of Asian nations. While this discussion is in its early stages, there are already advocates for the creation of a pan-Asian entity—the East Asian Community (EAC)—that would include closer economic and trade relations among its members, possibly even the creation of a single Asian currency. At the same time, there has been a separate ongoing discussion about greater regional economic and trade integration in Asia taking place in various fora. The Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum was formed in 1989 with the express mission of accelerating regional economic integration and fostering greater trade and investment liberalization through a process known as ""open regionalism."" ASEAN has also formed the core at periodic meetings of ASEAN + 3 and the EAS to consider ways and means of fostering closer economic and trade ties. For its own part, ASEAN has been pursuing ways to expedite closer economic ties amongst its 10 member nations with the goal of creating an ASEAN Economic Community. While security concerns were downplayed in the original ASEAN Declaration, the importance of regional peace and security was a major purpose behind ASEAN's formation. ASEAN has sought to maximize its security interests by developing a set of norms for its members, and beyond that has increasingly relied on consensus building and discussion as the preferred means of conflict resolution. That said, all is not tranquil among ASEAN members or between ASEAN states and external powers. There continue to be bilateral tensions among ASEAN states, as recently demonstrated by the border clashes between Cambodia and Thailand near the 11 th -century Preah Vihear Temple, and maritime disputes between Indonesia and Malaysia over the energy-rich Ambalat sea bloc in the Sulawesi Sea. Nevertheless, it does appear that ASEAN has played a key role in promoting a normative order that has minimized interstate conflict in Southeast Asia since the group's formation during the Cold War. ASEAN's key strategic value emanates from its geographic position as well as its economic development. ASEAN is situated astride the key sea lanes that link the energy-rich Persian Gulf and the economic power centers of East Asia. Maintaining the free flow of goods and energy through the strategically vital Malacca, Sunda, and Lombok Straits is a key geostrategic interest for ASEAN members, as well as the United States, Japan, China, and South Korea. Energy reserves in and around the South China Sea, Indonesia, and Burma also give the region added strategic importance. While ASEAN has been a key player in the creation of emerging economic and strategic architectures in Asia, such as the ASEAN + 3 and the East Asia Summit, it faces the increasingly challenging task of maintaining strategic balance and its pivotal role in this process. The emergence of China and India as great powers in an increasingly multi-polar world, and the continued engagement of the United States, present diplomatic challenges for ASEAN as it seeks to shape an international order that will promote peace and stability for the region. The United States and ASEAN share a mutual interest in preventing conflict and maintaining the independence of regional states. ASEAN as an organization will likely seek to balance external actors in the region while seeking to avoid antagonizing great powers. America's military posture in Asia supports ASEAN's goal of ensuring that no hegemon can arise that could dominate the region. As such, America is generally a valued offshore balancer relative to the perceived rising influence of China, though some ASEAN members—Laos, Cambodia, and Burma, in particular—are relatively closer to China than others. China also acts as a balancer to American presence in the region. While securing sea lanes of communication and trade that transit maritime Southeast Asia is of mutual importance among all interested states, there is the potential that increasingly intense competition for energy resources could lead to increased tensions. This could be the case should Chinese efforts to secure energy resources and routes entangle China and India in a security dilemma where ""defensive"" moves by one party are viewed as ""offensive,"" or threatening, by the other. This could also be the case should Chinese activity in Burma intensify. China is interested in developing an energy and trade corridor from Sittwe, Burma, to Kunming, China, which could be viewed as a means of lessening China's strategic vulnerability at the Strait of Malacca. Some in India are increasingly concerned that this move by China in Southeast Asia could be part of a larger strategy to encircle India. Territorial disputes in the South China Sea have been at the center of some of ASEAN's most active security-related diplomacy in recent decades—but also serve as an illustration of the difficulty of marshaling the group's diverse membership to act in concert. For decades, the Paracel and Spratly Islands have been the site of regional competition for control of the South China Sea among ASEAN members and China, and between individual ASEAN members themselves. The source of competition over this region is the desire to extend sovereignty over sea beds by establishing claims to the islands and thereby control important fishing areas and what are thought to be rich energy reserves beneath the sea. In the late 1990s and early 2000s, ASEAN's push for a Code of Conduct on the South China Sea to promote the norms of peaceful resolution of conflict—which resulted in the Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea signed by ASEAN's members and China in November 2002—can be viewed as one of the group's successes in acting in concert to promote common security interests of organization members. In 1992, following a series of incidents including China's sinking of three Vietnamese vessels near Fiery Cross Reef in the Paracels in 1988, ASEAN issued a declaration on the South China Sea, calling for a mutual code of conduct for nations navigating in the waters. This led to a decade of active diplomacy in which the organization's members largely held together to promote multilateral security in the area. By acting as a group, ASEAN states arguably have collectively more weight when dealing with any outside actor than they do when acting individually. However, the continuation of flare-ups in these waters is also an illustration of the limits of ASEAN's ability or willingness to act in concert to deal with external powers. In recent years, continued Chinese disputes with Vietnam and the Philippines have been kept largely bilateral, with ASEAN as a grouping opting not to lend formal support to its members in their disputes with China. This has had an effect on U.S. interests. In 2008, for instance, China warned international oil firms, including ExxonMobil, against exploring for energy resources in blocks leased by the Vietnamese government. Of ASEAN states, only Thailand was able to maintain a fair degree of political autonomy throughout the colonial period in Southeast Asia. The later colonial period witnessed the domination of Indo-China by France; Burma, Malaya, and Singapore by the United Kingdom; Indonesia by the Netherlands; and the Philippines by Spain and the United States. During World War II, the region came under the control of imperial Japan. These experiences led to a strong desire of ASEAN members to prevent their newly independent states from being dominated by any single power, as Japan did during WWII, and to preserve and expand their independence of action from external great powers. ASEAN was formed through the Bangkok Declaration of 1967 at the height of the Cold War, when external powers were directly or indirectly militarily engaged in the region. ASEAN was created largely as a reaction to Cold War pressures on the region. At the time, the United States was deeply engaged in the war in Vietnam, and the ongoing global struggle between the West and the Soviet bloc was intense. Small Southeast Asian states also sought in part to bring Indonesia into a regional grouping as a way of curbing its previously demonstrated ability to threaten regional neighbors, as it did with Malaya under its policy of Konfrontasi, which included a guerilla war on Borneo from 1963 to 1966 against British, Australian, New Zealand, and Malay security forces. While the Cold War is now history, ASEAN continues to be faced with the diplomatic, strategic and foreign policy challenges of how to deal with external great power actors in its region. Today, Soviet influence has faded and Chinese influence has expanded while the United States has sought to remain engaged in the region. ASEAN-China relations have become deeper, as China has engaged in a ""charm offensive"" since the late 1990s, seeking better diplomatic and trade relations with Southeast Asian states. The potential for larger Indian engagement with the region is also developing, as demonstrated by India's inclusion in the East Asia Summit. Some regional states continue to have outside bilateral or multilateral defense ties, some of which can be viewed as legacies of the colonial, post-WWII, and Cold War periods. These security relationships include the Five Power Defense Agreement between the United Kingdom, Malaysia, Singapore, Australia, and New Zealand and the U.S. alliances with the Philippines and Thailand that were originally part of the San Francisco system formed in the early 1950s. In addition, Indonesia has moved on somewhat from its non-aligned position by developing bilateral security ties with Australia. While there are some relatively low-level security concerns either between ASEAN states or at the sub-state level, as is the case with insurgents in Southern Thailand and the Southern Philippines, the largest threats to stability in the region as a whole emanate largely from outside the region and relate to the evolving correlates of power in Asia as a whole. It is for this reason that much of ASEAN's diplomatic activity and initiative has been focused at establishing a new Asian or trans-Pacific economic and strategic group that can seek to prevent or ameliorate conflict between the extra-regional powers that are active in the region, including the United States, China, Japan, South Korea, and India. For example, a conflict between China and the United States over Taiwan would likely have a devastating impact on regional trade and would place unwanted pressure on ASEAN states to pick sides. The general trend in recent decades of re-conceptualizing security as more than simply the realm of cross border conflict between the armed forces of sovereign nation states, or internal counterinsurgency operations, is clearly evident in Southeast Asia. This is evident from the negative impact of terrorist groups active in the region, such as Jemaah Islamiya and Abu Sayyaf, as well as from the relatively high incidence of piracy in maritime Southeast Asia. Jemaah Islamiya in Indonesia and Abu Sayyaf in the Philippines are two key terrorist groups that are a threat to Americans and Western interests in the region. Counterterrorism efforts by ASEAN states working with the United States and Australia have done much to hunt down regionally based terrorists. While the cultural heart of Islam is Mecca, the demographic heart of Islam is closer to Southeast Asia, as Indonesia has the world's largest Muslim population. Indonesia and Malaysia generally recognize a more tolerant and less fundamentalist form of Islam, which some argue could be a good starting point for increased engagement by the United States in the Muslim world. Contemporary security interests also encompass other sub-national and trans-regional levels of conflict in addition to interstate conflict. The conflicts that Indonesia has had in East Timor, Aceh, the Moluccas, and Papua, some of them still festering; ongoing insurgencies in Muslim areas of Thailand and the Philippines; and Burma's restive minority groups can be viewed in this context. ASEAN's reluctance to become involved in the internal affairs of its members has largely kept such issues from becoming the business of the group as a whole. Concepts of human security have also brought many analysts of security dynamics in the region to increasingly focus on the negative impacts of environmental degradation and the impact that climate change may have on the region. The ""haze"" generated by the burning of forests after logging operations brought this to the attention of regional governments concerned over public health risks in 1997. The damming of the upper reaches of the Mekong in China has also raised concerns over the long-term viability of that river system as a source of food for the region. Increased temperatures associated with climate change may undermine regional food production and cause sea level rise that would negatively impact low-lying coastal areas where many in the region live. Piracy in Southeast Asia has been a relatively large problem as compared with other areas of the world, with the exception of the Gulf of Aden and the Arabian Sea in recent years. Human and narcotics trafficking and the plight of refugees in the region are other human security issues worthy of attention. The ASEAN economies have become a major regional hub for globalized manufacturing. According to official ASEAN statistics, ASEAN's total merchandise trade exceeded $1.7 trillion (see Table 1 ). A little more than one-quarter of its trade was between ASEAN members. Another third was with the European Union (EU-25), Japan, and the United States. Trade with China claimed about one-tenth of the association's merchandise trade. The rest of ASEAN's trade was distributed around the world. In terms of the types of goods and commodities traded by ASEAN in 2008, three different groups far surpassed all other categories—electrical machinery, mineral fuels and oils, and mechanical appliances (see Table 2 ). Taken together, these items account for nearly 60% of ASEAN's exports and almost two-thirds of its imports. This pattern can be partially explained by ASEAN's role in the globalized manufacturing of electrical machinery and mechanical appliances. As described in a number of studies, the production of home appliances, computers, telecommunications equipment and other products that fall into these two categories has become a multi-country process, with components and parts being shipped between nations for final assembly in multiple competing countries. Much of ASEAN's intra-regional trade in intermediate goods ends up as components used in final assembly work done in China. While this multi-country assembly process is comparatively mobile and fluid, in recent years, the ASEAN nations—along with China—have become regionally integrated manufacturing hubs for selected products. According to official U.S. trade statistics, ASEAN's trade with the United States—like with the rest of the world—is dominated by electrical machinery (HTS 85) and mechanical appliances (HTS 84) (see Table 3 ). Over 40% of U.S. imports from ASEAN and nearly half of U.S. exports to ASEAN are in these two categories. Knit and non-knit clothing (HTS 61 and 62), plus rubber and articles made of rubber (HTS 40) are also major products imported from ASEAN. Other top-five U.S. exports to ASEAN are aircraft (HTS 88); optical and scientific equipment (HTS 90); and mineral fuels and oils (HTS 27). U.S. trade statistics show a larger U.S. trade deficit with ASEAN than ASEAN's statistics. Since the early 1990s, the ASEAN members have been gradually moving toward the creation of a free trade area encompassing the 10 members of the association. The ASEAN Free Trade Area (AFTA) is to be fully implemented in 2010 by six ASEAN countries and 2015 for the remaining signatories. Under AFTA's Common Effective Preferential Tariff (CEPT) Scheme, more than 99% of the product categories will have their intra-ASEAN tariff rates reduced to below 5%. In addition, the 10 ASEAN members have agreed to the goal of creating an ASEAN Economic Community (AEC) by 2015. During the ASEAN summit held in Cha-Am, Thailand on October 23-25, 2009, there was a recommitment to the 2015 goal for the creation of the AEC, as well as discussion of alternative ways of forming closer economic and trade ties with several Asian nations, including China, India, Japan, and South Korea. ASEAN's efforts to create the AEC have been complemented by its interest in negotiating trade agreements with key Asian nations. The United States is the only major power in the region that has not agreed to some form of formal free trade agreement (FTA) with ASEAN. As of October 2009, ASEAN had concluded trade agreements with the following countries: Australia and New Zealand —On February 29, 2009, ASEAN, Australia, and New Zealand signed the ASEAN-Australia-New Zealand Free Trade Area (AANZTA) Agreement. The agreement commits the parties to the progressive reduction of tariff and non-tariff trade barriers. China —On November 5, 2002, ASEAN and China set the goal of establishing an ASEAN-China Free Trade Area (ACFTA) within 10 years. The two sides subsequently signed an Agreement on Trade in Goods in 2004, and an Agreement on Trade in Services was entered into force in 2007. Under ACTFA, ASEAN and China began reducing tariff lines on a range of goods on January 1, 2010. On the ASEAN side, Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia, the Philippines, Thailand, and Brunei agreed to begin reductions in 2010, while Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia and Burma aren't expected to begin reductions until 2015. There has been early resistance within ASEAN to the tariff reductions, most sharply in Indonesia, where the government sought in January 2010 to postpone import tariff reductions on some 228 product lines, arguing that it needs to cushion domestic industries from Chinese competition. India —On August 13, 2009, ASEAN and India concluded an agreement on trade in goods that provides for the gradual reduction of tariff and non-tariff trade barriers, plus commits the parties to the establishment of an ASEAN-India Free Trade Area (AIFTA). Japan —In April 2008, ASEAN and Japan concluded negotiations for the creation of an ASEAN-Japan Free Trade Area (AJFTA). South Korea —On August 24, 2006, ASEAN and the Republic of Korea concluded the ASEAN-Korea Free Trade Agreement (AKFTA). The original document covered trade in goods. Since then ASEAN and South Korea have extended their trade arrangement to cover investment as well. ASEAN has also held talks with the European Union (EU) about a possible free trade agreement, but progress has been slow and prospects are unclear. Beyond its efforts to negotiate bilateral trade agreements with selected countries, ASEAN has also been actively promoting the creation of a larger, Asia-based free trade area. This possible regional economic association has been referred to by different names at different times, including the more recent East Asian Community (EAC). In some cases, the discussants have been limited to ASEAN + 3. In other cases, the group of nations has been expanded include the EAS (ASEAN + 6). During the East Asia Summit held in Hua-Hin, Thailand, on October 25, 2009, there was discussion about the nature of a possible EAC as well as which nations ought to be members. While there appeared to be some consensus to create a regional free trade area by 2020, there was no agreement on which nations should he part of such an arrangement. In particular, there were apparently sharp differences of opinion over the inclusion of the United States in the free trade area. Similarly, although Russia has applied for membership in the East Asia Summit, it is unclear if Russia is being considered for inclusion in the EAC. While some have suggested the possibility of an ASEAN-U.S. Free Trade Agreement, there are several structural problems to negotiating such an agreement. First, the United States would probably require that the trade agreement comply with the U.S. model FTA, a condition that ASEAN may not find acceptable. Second, the United States has a comprehensive ban on direct trade with Burma. Third, the ASEAN economies vary in their level of economic and legal development, which would make the FTA's compliance requirements difficult to specify. The Obama Administration's revision of U.S. policy toward Burma has coincided with a similar review by ASEAN of its stance on relations with the ruling junta, the State Peace and Development Council (SPDC). While the new U.S. policy may be viewed as a tacit admission that sanctions alone were not sufficient to effect change in Burma, recent statements and actions by ASEAN may indicate that their past policy of ""constructive engagement"" had proven equally ineffective. As a result, there may be an opportunity for ASEAN and the United States to confer and coordinate their policies toward Burma. During the U.S.-ASEAN leaders' meeting in November 2009, in which President Obama sat four chairs away from Burma's representative, Prime Minister Thein Sein, the United States raised the issue of human rights abuses in Burma and the need for democratic reforms and genuine dialogue with opposition leaders, and called upon the military government to release all political prisoners, including Nobel Peace Laureate Aung San Suu Kyi. The joint statement issued at the summit expressed the hope that the renewed dialogue between the United States and Burma, as well as ASEAN's efforts to work with the Burmese government, will ""contribute to broad political and economic reforms."" There was also a call for the government to conduct the proposed general election in 2010 in ""a fair, free, inclusive and transparent manner."" However, there was no mention of political prisoners or the release of opposition leaders. Although there was interest in including Burma as an original member of ASEAN in 1967, it did not join the association until 1997. From the start, ASEAN as an organization adopted a policy of ""constructive engagement"" toward Burma, refraining from public comments in its ""internal affairs,"" while some members sought closer economic, trade, and investment relations with Burma. Some of the strongest supporters of ASEAN's policy of ""constructive engagement"" toward Burma have been the governments of Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia, and Singapore, for slightly different reasons. Thailand has had an ambivalent view of Burma. Burmese domestic unrest has adverse direct impacts on Thailand, and Thailand suffers from the flow of both narcotics and refugees out of Burma. However, successive governments in Bangkok have felt an interest in maintaining at least some ability, even if limited, to deal with the Burmese regime, and to foster stability in Burma, with which Thailand shares a long border. Under the Suharto regime, the Indonesian government shared some ideological views with Burma's military government that led to its support of Burma's ASEAN membership and closer relations, although Jakarta has taken a harder line as the country has democratized. Malaysia at the time was concerned about both Chinese and U.S. influence in the region, and found similar views among Burma's military rulers. The Singaporean government saw economic opportunity in closer relations with Burma, and for a time was a major supplier of equipment and arms for the Burmese military, as well as a major investor in the country. The adoption of a new ASEAN Charter in 2007 may signal a greater willingness to address issues such as human rights and democracy. As previously mentioned, the new charter states that among ASEAN's purposes are strengthening democracy and protecting human rights, and mandated the establishment of an ""ASEAN human rights body."" However, among ASEAN's founding principles is a commitment to ""non-interference in the internal affairs of ASEAN Member States."" In practice, under the new charter, ASEAN has shown a greater willingness to express its opinion about the situation in Burma. In response to the conviction of Aung San Suu Kyi in August 2009, ASEAN's chairman issued a statement expressing ASEAN's ""deep disappointment"" at the verdict, calling for the immediate release of Aung San Suu Kyi and other political prisoners, and asserting that ""such actions will contribute to national reconciliation among the people of Myanmar, meaningful dialogue and facilitate the democratization of Myanmar."" In addition, ASEAN has indicated that the junta's treatment of opposition groups and ethnic minorities will affect how the election results will be perceived by the Association. Although ASEAN appears to be more willing to publicly criticize Burma's military government, it has not shown a greater willingness to impose economic sanctions on the country. Malaysia, Singapore, and Thailand are major trading partners with Burma, and may be reluctant to forswear the economic benefits of bilateral trade and investment. Indonesia's civilian government may be more willing to consider economic pressure on Burma, in part because of its history of military rule and in part because of its concern about Burma's Muslim minority. The conduct and outcome of Burma's 2010 parliamentary elections may prove critical to ASEAN's future relationship with Burma. While few expect a free and fair election, if the results provide some space for opposition views in the government and indicate a possible shift in power to civilian rule, then ASEAN will likely continue its policy of modified ""constructive engagement."" If, however, the election results provide only a veil of cover to the continuation of military rule, then ASEAN may be willing to consider adopting a tougher policy. In one of the first signs that the elections may lack credibility, in March 2010, the Burmese government enacted rules that require political parties to expel any members who are imprisoned, thus barring Aung San Suu Kyi from participating. U.S. assistance for Southeast Asian multilateral efforts focuses on trade facilitation, counterterrorism, security sector reform, and the environment. Other program areas include good governance, combating transnational crime, and education. U.S. funding for East Asia Pacific regional programs, a large portion of which supports ASEAN, ARF, and APEC objectives, totaled an estimated $20 million in 2009. In the area of security, U.S. foreign assistance supports the Counter-terrorism Regional Strategy Initiative, which focuses on transnational aspects of terrorism and regional responses. U.S. assistance to ARF includes funding for regional programs in counter-terrorism, combating transnational crime, disaster preparedness, and non-proliferation. USAID's Regional Development Mission Asia (RDMA) supports efforts to strengthen the capacity of the ASEAN Secretariat, develop regional economic institutions, and enhance ASEAN's Food Security Information System. RDMA also provides trade-related technical assistance and supports U.S. commitments under the ASEAN-U.S. Enhanced Partnership. In terms of bilateral assistance, the United States provided an estimated $526 million in FY2009 to nine ASEAN countries (Brunei Darussalam does not receive U.S. assistance). Since 2001, the Philippines and Indonesia have received large increases in U.S. assistance, largely for counterterrorism programs. Vietnam also has received large growth in U.S. aid, reflecting significant funding for HIV/AIDS programs. Among providers of bilateral official development assistance (ODA) as measured by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), Japan is by far the largest donor in the region, followed by the United States, although Japanese ODA includes a relatively large loan component. France, Germany, the United Kingdom, and Australia also provide significant ODA in the region. China has become a key source of financing and assistance for infrastructure, energy, and industrial development in Southeast Asia. ASEAN's most critical external relations continue to be with the United States, the region's primary security guarantor; Japan, the major provider of development assistance; and China, a rising source of aid, trade, and, according to some, strategic influence in the region. Many analysts argue that China's ""soft power""—global influence attained through economic, diplomatic, cultural, and other non-coercive means—has grown significantly in the past decade. Furthermore, many observers contend that China's diplomatic outreach, including building links to ASEAN, has surpassed that of the United States during the past several years. Most Southeast Asian leaders and foreign policy experts have welcomed engagement from both the United States and China because of the benefits that strong relations bring; they do not want a single foreign influence to dominate the region, and excluding either power is ""not an option."" Although Japan is a close development partner in the region, some Southeast Asians would welcome a more robust Japanese diplomatic and security presence. Many analysts view India as an ascendant but still nascent regional power that has an interest in balancing China's rise in the region. The United States exerts the most established and forceful military presence in the region, including alliances with the Philippines and Thailand (Major Non-NATO Allies), strong security cooperation with Singapore, counterterrorism cooperation with Indonesia and Malaysia, and military education programs in Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos. The United States is also engaged economically. It is ASEAN's fourth-largest trading partner, having been surpassed by China in recent years. The United States is a larger export market than China and the third-largest source of FDI from outside the region after the EU and Japan, followed by China (including Hong Kong) and South Korea. In terms of diplomacy and trade, many in ASEAN considered Washington neglectful of the organization under the Bush Administration, although some foundations were established upon which the Obama Administration has developed its policy of engagement. The United States was the first country to nominate an ambassador to ASEAN (2008). In 2009, the United States acceded to the Treaty of Amity and Cooperation (TAC), which was seen by many as a symbolic recognition of the value of a multilateral approach to regional security issues. The United States was the last major power in the region to sign the treaty. Although the United States has met the requirements for joining the EAS through its accession to the TAC, the Obama Administration remains undecided about its intent to do so. In 2005, the United States created a framework for U.S. assistance to ASEAN—the ASEAN-U.S. Enhanced Partnership—encompassing cooperation on political, security, economic, and development issues. This initiative was followed in 2007 by the ASEAN Development Mission Vision to Advance National Cooperation and Economic Integration (ADVANCE). Among the goals of the mission are to help ASEAN and its members work toward an ASEAN community, support the Enhanced Partnership, and promote the U.S.-ASEAN Trade and Investment Framework Agreement (TIFA), signed in 2006, which could be a precursor to a possible FTA with ASEAN. China's ties with ASEAN have reflected attempts to defuse security tensions in the South China Sea, promote economic integration, support infrastructure development, and cultivate diplomatic influence. Some experts argue that China's power projection in the region amounts to a coordinated attempt to dominate the region economically and ultimately militarily. Others contend that although China's influence is growing, in part due to declining American engagement, Beijing has neither the will nor the capacity to aggressively pursue such a strategy, and is content with the U.S. security role in the region, at least in the medium term. Moreover, many Southeast Asian countries remain wary of China's power and intentions and may seek ways to engage China while hedging against its rise. In 2002, China and ASEAN agreed to the Declaration on Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea as well as several other agreements on economic and agricultural cooperation and non-traditional security threats. China reportedly has favored the ASEAN + 3 (ASEAN, Japan, China, and South Korea) summit process, inaugurated in 1997, over other forums such as the ASEAN Regional Forum and the East Asia Summit. Nonetheless, China has become more active in ARF, which focuses on security issues and dialogue, exceeding U.S. involvement in recent years, according to some analysts. The formation of the EAS in 2005 represented an effort by some countries in the region, including Japan, to balance China's influence by including powers that generally are more aligned with the United States than China on security matters. However, some analysts perceive the U.S. absence in the grouping as working to China's advantage. In 2003, the PRC became the first country to accede to ASEAN's Treaty of Amity and Cooperation. China committed relatively early to a free trade agreement with ASEAN, signing a framework agreement in 2002 that set a 10-year deadline for an FTA, and then negotiating an actual trade pact that came into force in January 2010. In August 2009, China and ASEAN signed a new Investment Agreement to accompany the FTA. A major provider of bilateral development financing in the region and economic assistance to Laos, Cambodia, and Burma, in particular, Chinese leaders announced in April 2009 a plan to set up a $10 billion China-ASEAN Fund on Investment Cooperation to support new infrastructure. Other assistance promised at the time included $15 billion in loans to ASEAN countries to be allocated over three to five years, nearly $40 million to Cambodia, Laos, and Burma ""to meet urgent needs,"" $5 million for the China-ASEAN Cooperation Fund, and rice for a regional emergency rice reserve. Japan has been a close partner to ASEAN and the principal provider of development assistance to Southeast Asia, but its role has been relatively low-profile. In the past few years, Japanese governments have pledged to strengthen ties to the organization and to Indonesia, in part to balance China's rising influence. In November 2009, Japanese Prime Minister Yukio Hatoyama pledged $5.5 billion in assistance to the Mekong Delta region, in large part to bolster Japan's role in a part of Southeast Asia that is becoming economically integrated with China. Tokyo has long been actively involved in the three major satellite groupings—ASEAN + 3, ARF, and the EAS. While stressing the importance of Japanese ties with the United States, Japanese governments have supported the formation of an East Asian Community, which may include members of the EAS (ASEAN + 6) as its core (excluding the United States). ASEAN reportedly is divided over whether to include the United States in such a grouping. Japan acceded to the TAC in 2004 and appointed an ambassador to ASEAN in 2008. In 2005, the Japanese government reportedly pledged $70 million for ASEAN regional integration projects. Cooperation and aid activities with ASEAN have included counterterrorism, environmental protection, and preventing the spread of infectious diseases. In addition to the Japan-ASEAN FTA, Tokyo has signed Economic Partnership Agreements with Singapore, Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines, which involve not only trade liberalization but also the areas of labor movement, investment, intellectual property rights, and cultural and educational cooperation. Much of the congressional activity concerning Southeast Asia deals with bilateral relations and issues with individual Southeast Asian nations. In recent years, however, Congress has also sometimes played a leadership role in initiatives toward ASEAN. In 2006, Senator Richard Lugar introduced the U.S. Ambassador for ASEAN Affairs Act ( S. 2697 ), urging the Bush Administration to name an ambassador to the grouping. Its passage helped lead to the naming of Scot Marciel as the first U.S. Ambassador to ASEAN and the first ambassador to the organization from outside the region. There are several ways in which shifts in the U.S. approach toward ASEAN could be of importance to Congress. Congress may also seek to provide further assistance to support ASEAN's Secretariat and organizational capacity building. In trade policy, Congress may consider, on the one hand, pushing for further economic engagement and the passage of FTAs or other agreements with ASEAN and/or its member countries. In October 2009, Senator Richard Lugar introduced S.Res. 311 , calling for the start of discussions on a free trade agreement with ASEAN. Stalled FTA discussions with Malaysia and Thailand could potentially be considered by Congress, although this does not appear to be on the near-term agenda. On the other hand, Congress could prevent further FTA negotiations with Southeast Asian countries or ensure that labor and environmental concerns are addressed in such negotiations. Shifts in U.S. policy toward Burma and the implications for relations with ASEAN have been a major focus in 2009 and will likely continue to be of congressional interest. Senator Jim Webb, chair of the Senate East Asia and Pacific Affairs Subcommittee, in August 2009 became the first Member of Congress in 10 years to visit Burma. Senator Webb also traveled to Thailand, Cambodia, Laos and Vietnam, where he reportedly told leaders that ASEAN should call for the release of Aung San Suu Kyi. Over recent years, Congress has been a leader of the U.S. sanctions policy toward the Burmese regime through legislation such as the Burmese Freedom and Democracy Act of 2003 and the Tom Lantos Block Burmese JADE (Junta's Anti-Democratic Efforts) Act of 2008. The conduct and outcome of parliamentary elections set to be held in Burma in 2010 may play a significant role in how the Obama Administration implements its new Burma policy, and in its relations with ASEAN vis-à-vis Burma. Congress may seek to play an active role in the development of U.S. policy toward Burma and ASEAN, both before and after Burma's elections. The development of ASEAN's human rights body may also merit attention. Congress has frequently considered legislation and resolutions concerning human rights conditions in Southeast Asia, and ASEAN's emerging human rights approaches may be of interest in future consideration of how to promote human rights in the region.","The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) is Southeast Asia's primary multilateral organization. Established in 1967, it has grown into one of the world's largest regional fora, representing a strategically important group of 10 nations that spans critical sea lanes and accounts for 5% of U.S. trade. This report discusses U.S. diplomatic, security, trade, and aid ties with ASEAN, analyzes major issues affecting Southeast Asian countries and U.S.-ASEAN relations, and examines ASEAN's relations with other regional powers. Much U.S. engagement with the region occurs at the bilateral level, but this report focuses on multilateral diplomacy. The United States has deep-seated ties in Southeast Asia, and it has viewed ASEAN as a useful organization since its inception during the Cold War. Today, U.S. policy toward ASEAN and Southeast Asia is cast against the backdrop of great power rivalry in East Asia, and particularly China's emergence as an active diplomatic actor in its geographic backyard. Some worry that the United States, preoccupied with other priorities, has been neglectful of ASEAN and of Asian multilateral diplomacy in recent years. The Obama Administration has expressed an intent to work more closely with multilateral organizations, particularly ASEAN. A number of steps in this direction include Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's visit to the ASEAN Secretariat in Jakarta in February 2009, the U.S. accession to ASEAN's Treaty of Amity and Cooperation (TAC) in July 2009, and President Obama's attendance at the ASEAN leaders meeting in November 2009. Congress has frequently played an important role in shaping U.S. diplomatic, security, and economic relations with Southeast Asia and ASEAN. Major U.S. and congressional interests in Southeast Asia include maritime security, the promotion of democracy and human rights, the encouragement of liberal trade and investment regimes, counterterrorism, combating narcotics trafficking, environmental preservation, and many others. In October 2009, Senator Richard Lugar introduced S.Res. 311, calling for the start of discussions on a free trade agreement with ASEAN. In August 2009, Senator Jim Webb visited five countries in mainland Southeast Asia and was the first Member of Congress in 10 years to visit Burma. The United States exerts a strong military and economic presence in Southeast Asia, and through diplomacy it seeks to remain a major power—perhaps the major power—in the region. ASEAN, however, has been active in recent years in exploring a variety of diplomatic architectures for East Asia and the Pacific. ASEAN is at the center of several broader security- and trade-related groupings in the Asia-Pacific region, through which it has aimed to maintain regional multi-polarity or a balance of powers among itself and other states including the United States, China, and Japan. ASEAN is also the nexus for discussion of regional economic integration. ASEAN has launched an internal free trade accord, the ASEAN Free Trade Agreement (AFTA), which will go into full effect in 2015. ASEAN has also concluded FTAs with many external trade partners, though not with the United States. ASEAN has also been exploring ways to advance the ultimate creation of a broader European Union-like East Asia Community. Some within the group—but not all—support the inclusion of the United States in such a community. Human rights conditions, particularly in some ASEAN members such as Burma, have long been a source of friction between the organization and the United States. ASEAN's new Charter, enacted in 2007, attempts to bring more pressure to bear upon recalcitrant member states. However, ASEAN still operates on principles of consensus and non-interference in the internal affairs of its members, so it remains unclear how active an actor it will be in this area.",govreport
"Low farm milk prices and declining dairy farm incomes in 2009 renewed congressional interest in imposing new import barriers on milk protein concentrates (MPCs), which generally include casein, the main protein found in milk, and caseinates, a soluble form of casein. MPCs are derived from raw milk and are used in a variety of food products, animal feed, and industrial products. Currently, U.S. imports of MPCs have limited or no trade restrictions while many other dairy product imports are restricted by tariff-rate quotas. Advocates of stricter import controls on MPCs say they would prevent the unlimited importation of milk protein, which would encourage the use of domestically produced protein and raise milk prices for dairy farmers. Opponents respond that the prospective move would increase their costs and result in higher retail food prices. Major foreign suppliers of MPCs to the U.S. market would likely seek compensation under World Trade Organization (WTO) rules for new U.S. restrictions on MPC imports. Concerns about MPC imports have periodically surfaced since import levels rose sharply in the late 1990s. At that time, the U.S. price of nonfat dry milk, which competes on some level with MPC as a protein ingredient, was above the price for milk proteins in the international market, making the U.S. market an attractive destination. When the world and domestic prices began to converge in 2001, MPC imports dropped off significantly and have since remained at or below peak levels reached in 2000. Milk is comprised mostly of water, measured at 87.4% of total weight. The remaining 12.6% is called ""milk solids,"" which is split four ways: fat (3.7% of total weight), protein (3.4%), lactose or sugar (4.8%), and minerals (0.7%). Milk protein is of two basic types: casein (2.8% of total weight or 82% of total protein) and whey protein (lactalbumin) (0.6% of total weight or 18% of total protein). Casein is extracted from milk by injecting a certain enzyme or acid into skim milk. Historically, casein was used in both industrial applications such as for glue and paper coatings, and in foods, mainly as an ingredient for ""nondairy foods"" such as imitation cheese, coffee creamers, and margarine. Whey protein is found in liquid whey, which is a by-product of the cheese manufacturing process that must be further processed to retrieve the protein. Whey protein is also used in a variety of food products. A ""milk protein concentrate"" (MPC) contains both casein and whey protein, and is often identified by its protein content, such as MPC42 for a product with 42% protein. MPCs are manufactured by ultrafiltration (use of membranes to separate larger molecules from smaller molecules in skim milk), blending (combinations of two or more products, such as skim milk powder and casein), or co-precipitation (a procedure similar to casein extraction). Protein concentrates have wide-ranging applications in the food manufacturing industry. Products that contain protein concentrates include infant formula, processed cheese products, imitation cheese, cultured products, frozen desserts, and specialty sports and medical nutrition products. Various protein levels are used in different products: MPC42-MPC56 are generally used in non-standardized cheeses (e.g., brie, ricotta), while MPC70-MPC85 are used in sports drinks and nutritional supplements. MPC90 is used in lactose-free or sugar-free products. Aside from the level of protein, some food manufacturers cite better ""functionality"" for MPC as an ingredient compared with nonfat dry milk (approximately 35% protein). Some typical functional characteristics include solubility, viscosity, water-binding, whipping and foaming, gelling, and heat stability. Also, processors favor MPC where exact product composition is important or where lactose (present in nonfat dry milk) is not needed or wanted. The United States produces very little casein or milk protein concentrates. Some dairy economists suggest that the federal dairy policies, particularly the Dairy Product Price Support program, have encouraged the production of nonfat dry milk (NDM) at the expense of milk protein concentrate or casein by assuring a buyer (i.e., the government) for NDM. Producers and others counter that foreign subsidies for exports of dairy products have at times limited U.S. production of protein products. U.S. imports of dairy products were valued at just over $3 billion in 2008 as measured by the USDA's Foreign Agricultural Service ( Table 1 ), with cheese accounting for the largest share at 38%. MPCs and casein/caseinates combined represented 35% of total import value. The United States also imports butter, lactose, and a variety of other dairy products such as chocolate milk drinks, pudding, and milk components for food manufacturing. Constraints on dairy product imports are affected by import barriers (see "" Import Barriers ""), which are needed to maintain the integrity of the domestic dairy program. The U.S. dairy program supports prices of dairy products and pays farmers subsidies when milk prices decline below certain levels. Unlimited market access would leave open the potential for import surges that could result in large purchases by the federal government under the price support program and/or lower farm prices that would drive up payments under the Milk Income Loss Contract (MILC) program. Dairy imports are modest relative to domestic production. The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) estimated import quantities during 2000-2004 at about 3% of milk production, driven primarily by cheese imports. More recent figures indicate little change since then. During most of the last decade, total U.S. imports of MPCs and casein/caseinates have hovered around 150,000 metric tons or less ( Figure 1 ). Since the sharp rise in the late 1990s, there has been no discernible import trend, with a sharp decline in 2009 (reportedly related to weak demand) following a rise in 2008. Primary U.S. suppliers include New Zealand, Australia, and the European Union ( Figure 2 and Figure 3 ). Until 1995, imports of almost all dairy products (butter, cheese, dry milk) were subject to section 22 import quotas. Section 22 of the Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1933 (7 U.S.C. 624(f)) requires the President to impose quantitative limitations or fees on imports that the President finds are being, or are practically certain to be, imported under such conditions and in such quantities as to render or tend to render ineffective, or materially interfere with, any USDA domestic support or stabilization program. Dairy products that were not covered by section 22 quotas included casein, caseinates, whey, and soft-ripened cow's milk cheese (e.g., brie). The 1995 WTO Uruguay Round Agreement on Agriculture converted section 22 quotas (including dairy product quotas) into tariff rate quotas (TRQs). (The United States also agreed to progressive reductions in the quantity and value of export subsidies under the Dairy Export Incentive Program or DEIP.) Importers of dairy products under the low tariff in a TRQ must apply for a license from USDA. No license is required for over-quota imports which are subject to a higher tariff. Since MPCs and casein imports had not been restricted under section 22, they were not subject to TRQs, nor were they subject to licensing requirements. Legislation to implement the WTO Uruguay Round Agriculture Agreement ( P.L. 103-465 ) amended section 22 to prohibit the application of quantitative import limitations or fees on products from other WTO members. Imports of MPCs are classified under the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTS) under subheadings 0404.90.10 for imports with a protein concentration of 40% to 90% and under 3501.10.10 for imports with a protein concentration of 90% or more. Imports of casein and caseinates are classified under subheadings 3501.10.50 and 3501.90.60. MPCs are subject to a very low tariff of 0.37 cents per kilogram. Imports of casein (under 3501.10.50) are duty free; other casein derivatives have a tariff of 0.37 cents per kilogram. During the early 2000s, milk producers and their supporters in Congress tried to change the tariff treatment of MPCs by petitioning the U.S. Customs Service to change the tariff classification of MPCs and by introducing legislation that would have established TRQs for MPCs. In 2002, the U.S. Customs Service (now Customs and Border Protection (CBP)) received a petition from the National Milk Producers Federation (NMPF) to review the tariff classification of MPCs and to change the classification from a non-quota to a quota classification. In its petition, the NMPF contended that dairy products classified under HTS 0404.90.10 did not meet the statutory definition of MPCs and were therefore not classifiable under that subhead of the HTS. They should instead, according to NMPF, be classified under heading 0402 which covers ""milk and cream, concentrated or containing added sugar or other sweetening matter."" If so classified, MPCs would become subject to TRQs and also in many cases would require import licenses. NMPF contended that to be properly classified as MPCs, a product must have been produced using the process of ultrafiltration and must contain casein and lactalbumin (whey protein) in the same proportion as found in milk. CBP responded, however, that the statutory language (Additional U.S. Note 13 to Chapter 4 of the HTS) refers to ""any complete milk protein (casein plus lactalbumin) concentrate that is 40% or more protein by weight."" Congress in the Additional Note had not specified a manufacturing process nor had it prohibited any blend or mix that met the 40% protein content by weight criterion. Thus, according to CBP, MPCs imported under 0404.90.10 met the statutory conditions provided in Additional Note 13 and were properly classified. During early 2003, bills were introduced in the 108 th Congress ( H.R. 1160 , S. 560 ) that would have accomplished the same purposes as legislation that has been introduced in the 111 th Congress (see "" New Legislative Import Restrictions Proposed ""). Both H.R. 1160 and S. 560 languished in committee. The Milk Import Tariff Equity Act ( S. 1542 ) was introduced on July 30, 2009, to limit imports of MPCs, casein, and caseinates. A companion bill was introduced in the House ( H.R. 3674 ) on September 29, 2009, with slight differences in aggregate quantities of permitted MPCs under the new tariff designations. S. 1542 would introduce two separate TRQs. The first would be for MPCs classified under HTS subheading 0404.90.10 for imports with a protein concentration of 40% to 90%. Annual imports in excess of 18,488 metric tons would be assessed a duty of $1.56/kg ($0.708/lb.). The second TRQ would be for the combined imports of three products: milk protein concentrate (90% protein), casein, and caseinates (HTS 3501.10.10, 3501.10.50, and 3501.90.60, respectively). Annual imports in excess of 55,477 metric tons would be assessed a duty of $2.16/kg ($0.98/lb.). The duty on import quantities below each quota would remain at the current low level ($0.0037/kg or $0.0017/lb.), except for imports under HTS 3501.10.50, which would remain free. More than half the annual trade in MPCs and casein/caseinates would be affected by the new, higher duties. Imports under HTS 0404.90.10 averaged 51,000 metric tons during 2006-2008 compared with 18,499 metric tons under the proposed TRQ. Similarly, imports of casein products averaged 108,000 metric tons compared with 55,477 metric tons under the proposed TRQ. Enactment of the proposed legislation likely would entail the United States' entering into compensation negotiations with WTO member countries that are major suppliers of MPCs to the U.S. market. S. 1542 authorizes the President to enter into such negotiations (Section 3). Article XXVIII of the original General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT 1947) provides the mechanism for WTO member countries to negotiate compensation when a tariff concession (in this case the current low tariff for MPC imports) is modified or withdrawn. Article XXVIII allows member countries to increase tariffs or set new TRQs, but in exchange for withdrawing or modifying a concession compensation must be provided to affected member countries. Compensation does not mean a monetary payment; it means, in this case, that the United States is supposed to offer a benefit or concession such as a tariff reduction which is equivalent to the benefits which the United States has withdrawn or modified. Formulas for determining the amount of compensation are provided in the Understanding on the Interpretation of Article XXVIII that is part of the 1994 WTO Uruguay Round Agreements (GATT 1994). The Understanding on Article XXVIII provides that when an unlimited tariff concession is replaced by a TRQ, the amount of compensation provided should exceed the amount of the trade actually affected by the modification. The basis for the calculation of compensation is the amount by which future trade prospects exceed the level of the quota. The calculation spelled out in the Understanding says that the calculation of future trade prospects should be based on the greater of: (a) the average annual trade in the most recent representative three-year period, increased by the average annual growth rate of imports in that same period, or by 10%, whichever is the greater, or (b) trade in the most recent year increased by 10%. Based on these formulas and recent trade data, the aggregate amount of compensation for which the United States might be liable could be an estimated $500 million. Compensation could be in the form of tariff reductions on other products or other benefits. Article XXVIII negotiations would be held on a bilateral basis. That would mean that negotiations would be conducted with such principle suppliers as New Zealand, the European Union, India, and Australia. A major issue would be quota allocation. Current quotas for most dairy products are distributed on an historical basis, while importers must apply for licenses to import dairy products. On February 7, 2006, the Canadian Minister of Agriculture announced that Canada would be initiating negotiations under GATT Article XXVIII to restrict imports of MPCs. This trade policy move came after a year of work by a Canadian government-initiated technical working group composed of producers and processors failed to reach agreement on a common approach to challenges facing the Canadian dairy industry. Main suppliers of MPCs to the Canadian market are New Zealand and the European Union. It appears, according to USDA's Foreign Agricultural Service, that the Article XXVIII process would not be applicable to Canada's NAFTA partners (the United States and Mexico). The main dairy producer group, Dairy Farmers of Canada (DFC), is the major supporter of the move to restrict Canadian imports of MPCs. Canadian dairy processors, again according to FAS, have worked to restrict the scope of new restrictions to items imported under HTS of Canada Chapter 35, MPCs with a milk protein content equal to or greater than 85% by weight. If import restrictions on MPC were broadened beyond Chapter 35, the expectation among some observers is that Canadian dairy processors would shift operations to the United States. The Canada Gazette reported that the Article XXVIII negotiations were concluded in June of 2008 and that Canada would include in its tariff schedule a TRQ for MPCs with protein content of 85% or more by weight. Within quota quantities of MPC 85+ will enter free of duty, while over quota amounts will be subject to a 270% ad valorem tariff. The TRQ does not apply to NAFTA countries and other countries with which Canada has free trade agreements. U.S. milk producers in general support legislation to limit imports of MPCs. The National Milk Producers Federation (NMPF), the largest trade organization representing dairy farmers, supports the proposed legislation ""in order to close a loophole in the U.S. dairy sector allowing certain dairy proteins ... to enter the U.S. and disrupt farm-level prices."" Similarly, the National Farmers Union supports restrictions on MPCs. Although the NMPF supports the legislation, the organization has stated that imports are not the cause of the economic problem the industry is currently facing and cautions against taking import measures that could harm prospects for U.S. dairy exports. The International Dairy Foods Association (IDFA), representing dairy product processors and manufacturers, is adamantly opposed to more restrictions on dairy imports. IDFA is concerned that such a move would increase production costs for food manufacturers, raise prices for consumer products, and put at risk recent gains in U.S. dairy exports. They also argue that domestic production of MPCs is not sufficient to meet demands of food manufacturers, and MPCs are not interchangeable with domestically produced nonfat dry milk. The potential price impact of imposing TRQs depends on the level of farm prices relative to the implied level of support under the Dairy Product Price Support Program (DPPSP). In general, if dairy product prices (and hence, farm milk prices) are low relative to USDA's purchase price levels, resulting in USDA purchases of dairy products from manufacturers, the impact of additional imports falls primarily on the dairy program (i.e., higher government purchases and program costs) rather than on farm prices. Hence, stricter import controls could result in reduced government purchases of dairy products (and lower outlays). Conversely, if product prices are well above DPPSP purchase prices and the program becomes inactive, the impact shifts to the market. USDA purchased surplus dairy products from October 2008 to October 2009, primarily nonfat dry milk, with the pace slowing considerably in late summer 2009. This leaves open the question whether imposing TRQs on MPCs and caseins/caseinates would have affected farm prices. Dairy product prices have since moved above support levels. To the extent product prices remain above purchase prices in the DPPSP, the magnitude of the impact on farm milk prices would depend on: (a) the amount of product not imported because of the TRQ, and (b) how this quantity (in milk equivalent) relates to overall U.S. milk production. Using the proposed TRQ levels and average imports from 2006-2008, the amount of over-quota imports would total 85,000 metric tons. Converted to farm milk equivalent, the over-quota imports would equate to approximately 1.2 billion pounds of farm milk or about 0.7% of average U.S. milk production during 2006-2008. By itself, this amount of milk equivalent, if made unavailable to the U.S. market, would have a relatively small effect on average U.S. farm milk prices. However, some view it as part of a larger set of policies that would help address the current financial situation for U.S. dairy farmers. ","Low farm milk prices and declining dairy sector income in 2009 renewed congressional interest in imposing new import barriers on milk protein concentrates (MPCs), which generally include casein, the main protein found in milk, and caseinates, a soluble form of casein. To limit U.S. imports of MPCs, the Milk Import Tariff Equity Act was introduced in the Senate (S. 1542) on July 30, 2009, and in the House (H.R. 3674) on September 29, 2009. Advocates of stricter import controls on MPCs say they would prevent the unlimited importation of milk protein, which would encourage the use of domestically produced protein and raise milk prices for dairy farmers. Opponents, including dairy product manufacturers, respond that the prospective move would increase their costs and result in higher retail food prices. MPCs are used in a variety of food products (e.g., infant formula, processed cheese products, and specialty sports and medical nutrition products), animal feed, and industrial products. Currently, U.S. imports of MPCs are assessed very low or no tariffs while many other dairy product imports are restricted by tariff-rate quotas (TRQs), which impose low import duties on quantities inside a quota while quantities above the quota are charged higher duty rates. During most of the last decade, total imports of MPCs have hovered around 150,000 metric tons or less. Imports fill a gap in limited domestic production. Until 1995, imports of almost all dairy products (butter, cheese, and dry milk) were subject to import quotas, which were established under Section 22 of the Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1933 to prevent imports from interfering with USDA domestic support programs. Dairy products that were not covered by section 22 quotas included casein, caseinates, whey, and soft-ripened cow's milk cheese (e.g., brie). The 1995 Uruguay Round Agreement on Agriculture converted section 22 quotas (including dairy product quotas) into TRQs. Since MPCs and casein imports had not been restricted under section 22, they were not subject to TRQs. The proposed bills in the 111th Congress, which are similar to previously introduced legislation, would establish two separate TRQs for (1) MPCs with a protein concentration of 40% to 90%, and (2) the combined imports of three products: milk protein concentrate (90% protein), casein, and caseinates. Based on recent trade data, more than half the annual trade in MPCs and casein/caseinates would be affected by the new, higher duties. Under World Trade Organization (WTO) rules for any new U.S. restrictions on imports, enactment of the proposed legislation likely would entail the United States' entering into compensation negotiations with WTO member countries that are major suppliers of MPCs to the U.S. market. The amount of compensation for which the United States might be liable would be on based on WTO formulas, recent trade data, and bilateral negotiations with principal suppliers. Farm-level impacts of new TRQs depend on whether dairy product prices are below or above federal price support levels. If below, farm milk prices would likely not be affected because they would already be supported above market-clearing levels, and trade restrictions would simply limit government purchases of dairy products under the price support program. If above, farm prices would likely increase to the extent that product is withheld from the market. Based on recent trade data, this quantity is estimated to represent about 0.7% of U.S. milk production. The pace of USDA dairy product purchases slowed considerably in late summer 2009, leaving open the question of whether imposing TRQs on MPCs would have affected farm prices at that time. Market prices for dairy products have since moved above support levels.",govreport
"The Robinson-Patman Act (R-P)(15 U.S.C. §§13, 13a, 13b, 21a) was enacted in 1936 with the specific purpose of creating and maintaining a market atmosphere in which small business could compete effectively, at least in the purchase of commodities, with its larger rivals. The immediate impetus for that Depression-era legislation was concern for smaller grocery store operators who complained that their businesses were suffering as the direct result of the activities of the chain grocery stores generally and the Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea Company (A&P) particularly. In pertinent part, the statute states that it shall be unlawful for any person engaged in commerce, in the course of such commerce, either directly or indirectly, to discriminate in price between different purchasers of commodities of like grade and quality, where either or any of the purchases involved in such discrimination are in commerce, where such commodities are sold for use, consumption, or sale within the United States ..., and where the effect of such discrimination may be substantially to lessen competition or tend to create a monopoly in any line of commerce, or to injure, destroy, or prevent competition with any person who either grants or knowingly receives the benefit of such discrimination, or with the customers of either of them. As is noted in a 1986 article, ""[f]or the first time within the umbrella of the federal antitrust laws, the Congress declared that it was enacting legislation to remedy injury to competitors rather than a generalized injury to competition itself."" Very simply, the act prohibits sellers in interstate commerce from charging different purchasers different prices for goods of ""like grade and quality."" It applies only to the sale of goods (i.e., it does not apply to the sale of services) and only where each sale is of goods purchased for resale within the United States (i.e., it does not prohibit price differentials between goods sold for resale within the United States and those sold for export). Since its enactment in 1936, the Robinson-Patman Act has been less than enthusiastically viewed by the Department of Justice, which believes that the act is not beneficial to consumers. In its 1977 Report on the Robinson-Patman Act, the Antitrust Division noted that It should not be surprising ... that Robinson-Patman can be shown to have many adverse effects on the economy. To be sure, there are some who do not recognize these effects or who argue that they are outweighed by benefits to specific sectors of the economy, notably small business; to competition by preventing increased concentration in a line of commerce; and to public values in general by establishing as a legal norm the concept of 'fair dealing' in pricing. But any discussion of the benefits of Robinson-Patman can be made only with a clear understanding of the burdens that the statute places on American economic activity. Government enforcement of the act, therefore, has always been entrusted to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), which over the years has acted inconsistently with respect to R-P actions. The bulk of R-P cases have generally been brought by disfavored buyers. In addition to the commodities-not-of-""like grade and quality"" and sales-for-export justifications for price differentials, an additional, affirmative defense permitted to refute the Robinson-Patman illegality of differential pricing is the so-called ""meeting competition"" defense, which has at least two levels: a defendant may assert (and must prove) that the lower price charged to a favored buyer was selected in order to permit the seller to meet that of a competing seller (primary line competition); or he may assert (and must prove) that the challenged price was necessary in order to enable his buyer to meet the competition of one of the buyer's competitors (secondary line competition). A seller may not, however, knowingly ""beat"" the prices of a competitor. A Robinson-Patman defendant may also successfully defend his challenged pricing activity if he can show that his price differentials were ""cost justified""—that is, that the price differential made only due allowance for the costs incurred in producing or delivering the goods. There is yet another defense to an allegation of unlawful price differentials under the Robinson-Patman Act. The 1938 Nonprofit Institutions Act (15 U.S.C. §13c), which expressly permits price breaks on ""purchases of their supplies for their own use by schools, colleges, universities, public libraries, churches, hospitals, and charitable institutions not operated for profit"" (emphasis added), created a broad exemption from the general price-discrimination prohibition. As the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit stated in 1967: The underlying intent in granting such an exemption was indisputably to permit institutions which are not in business for a profit to operate as inexpensively as possible. Two Supreme Court opinions, announced in the mid-1970s and early 1980s, provided significant interpretations of the scope of the nonprofit exemption from the Robinson-Patman prohibition. Both involved challenges to the practice of a pharmaceutical supplier who was selling its products to certain hospitals at prices lower than those charged to retail pharmacists in the areas surrounding the hospitals in question. Abbott Laboratories v. Portland Retail Druggists Association, Inc ., 425 U.S. 1 (1976), discussed the ""for their own use"" phrase in the Nonprofit Institutions Act, and interpreted the provision strictly. The Court relied largely on the ""for their own use"" language to hold that not all purchases made by a nonprofit hospital are necessarily exempt from price discrimination prohibitions. The exemption is applicable only to those purchases made in order to enable the hospital to meet the needs of the hospital (e.g., dispensing to inpatients, outpatients treated in the hospital, emergency room use) and those of staff physicians, medical and nursing students, and their dependents: ""The Congress surely did not intend to give the hospital a blank check."" Although the Court included within permissible uses by the hospital, ""genuine take home prescription[s], intended, for a limited and reasonable time, as a continuation of, or supplement to, the treatment that was administered at the hospital to the patient who needed, and now continues to need, that treatment,"" it specifically excluded from the Robinson-Patman exemption embodied in the Nonprofit Institutions Act ""the refill for the hospital's former patient."" Further, the Court refused to sanction purchases by the hospital-based physician for use in ""that portion of his private practice unconnected with the hospital."" While the primary concern addressed by the Court in Portland was the sale of pharmaceuticals to nonprofit hospitals for all uses, including patient care and resale, four years later, in Jefferson County Pharmaceutical Ass'n., Inc. v. Abbott Laboratories, 460 U.S. 150 (1983), the Court set out the limits of the exception to Robinson-Patman for government purchases: Jefferson County presented an issue ""limited to state [read 'nonprofit hospital'] purchases for the purposes of competing against private enterprise—with the advantage of discriminatory prices—in the retail market."" Jefferson County stressed that Robinson-Patman's prohibitions against unjustified discriminatory price differentials in the sale of commodities of ""like grade and quality"" dictated that government [nonprofit hospital] purchases for use in retail competition with private enterprise, as opposed to those for ""traditional governmental [hospital] functions,"" are fully subject to the strictures of the act. The Court held that purchases of pharmaceuticals by the University of Alabama Hospital for uses other than in the treatment of its patients, as, for example, in retail sales, may not be made at prices which would give the University Hospital an unfair price advantage over its competitors in the retail sale of pharmaceuticals. Health maintenance organizations were found to be ""eligible institutions"" under the Nonprofit Institutions Act in De Modena v. Kaiser Foundation Health Plan, Inc ., 743 F.2d 1388 (9 th Cir. 1984), cert. denied , 469 U.S. 1229 (1985). After acknowledging that the act ""does not explicitly list HPs [health plans],"" and that no case law at that time specifically included HPs as ""charitable"" institutions, the appeals court relied on ""precedent defining the term charitable for purposes of the tax code and the law of charitable trusts"" to reach its conclusion: ""[T]he emergence of social welfare, insurance, and municipal hospitals [has] drastically reduced the number of poor requiring free or below cost medical services"": This reduction eliminated the rationale upon which the traditional, limited definition of charitable was predicated, resulting in a move towards a less restrictive interpretation of the term in recent years. Now all non-profit organizations which promote health are considered charitable under the law of charitable trusts. Further, a number of courts have specifically held that health maintenance organizations, such as HPs, are charitable institutions for tax purposes. ... Given this increasingly liberal interpretation of the term, we conclude that the [defendant] HPs are charitable institutions within the meaning of the Nonprofit Institutions Act. Further, the court relied on the expression of the ""for their own use"" criterion propounded by the Supreme Court in Abbott Laboratories v. Portland Retail Druggist s to decide that the ""basic institutional function"" of a health plan—providing a ""complete panoply"" of health-care services, including continuing and preventative services, to its members—requires that ""drugs purchased by an HMO ... for resale to its members [be considered as] purchased for the HMO's 'own use' within the meaning of the Nonprofit Institutions Act."" De Modena was endorsed in 1995 by the United States District Court for Northern Illinois: In De Modena the Ninth Circuit resolved to 'follow the true mandate of Abbott ... by determin[ing] the basic institutional function of [the HMO in issue] and then decid[ing] which sales are in keeping with this function.' De Modena , 743 F.2d at 1393. The court began its analysis by recognizing that the intended institutional operation of an HMO is to 'provide a complete panoply of health care to [its] members.' Id. The court further observed that, unlike the 'temporary and usually remedial' care that fee-for-service hospitals provide to their patients, HMOs 'provide continuing and often preventative health care for their members.' Id . Thus, concluded the De Modena court, 'any sale of drugs by an HMO to one of its members falls within the basic function of the HMO' and, therefore, constitutes 'own use' within the meaning of the Nonprofit Institutions Act. Id . To our knowledge, the inclusion of HMOs in the list of entities entitled to take advantage of the ""for their own use"" language of the Nonprofit Institutions Act has not been judicially repudiated, although the Supreme Court has not yet provided an opinion on the subject. If none of the affirmative defenses set out above justifies a challenged price differential, and the non-profit exemption is unavailable to the defendant, price discrimination in violation of the Robinson-Patman Act is proved. That the successful plaintiff is entitled to damages in the amount of the unlawful price differential is not, however, a foregone conclusion. In J.Truett Payne Company, Inc. v. Chrysler Motors Corporation, the Supreme Court, deciding ""the appropriate measure of damages in a suit brought under § 2(a) of the Clayton Act,"" rejected the contention that ""once [a plaintiff] has proved a price discrimination in violation of § 2(a) it is entitled at a minimum to so-called 'automatic damages' in the amount of the price discrimination:"" To recover treble damages [the measure of antitrust damages under 15 U.S.C. § 15, which requires as a prerequisite to recovery that one have been 'injured in his business or property'], then, a plaintiff must make some showing of actual injury attributable to something the antitrust laws were designed to prevent. Previously, the Court had noted that ""[t]he automatic-damages theory has split the lower courts,"" but found more persuasive the opinions that rejected it, noting that Robinson-Patman ""is violated merely upon showing that 'the effect of such discrimination may be substantially to lessen competition.'"" In the mid 1970s, the 94 th Congress, through an Ad Hoc Subcommittee of the House Small Business Committee, held hearings on and considered proposals to amend or repeal the Robinson-Patman Act. At that time, representatives of small business, and others, contended that retention of Robinson-Patman was essential. Although the Subcommittee received several draft bills from the Department of Justice to either substantially amend, or to repeal the act, no legislation was introduced at that time, and CRS is not aware of any introduced at any time thereafter. The Antitrust Modernization Commission was authorized in P.L. 107-273 , ""21 st Century Department of Justice Appropriations Authorization Act,"" to ""examine whether the need exists to modernize the antitrust laws and to identify and study related issues,"" and issued its final Report in April 2007. In its chapter on ""Government Exceptions to Free-Market Competition,"" it devoted several pages to its study of the Robinson-Patman Act, noting that despite the aim of supporters of its passage to remedy the ""concern of small businesses … that they were losing share to larger supermarkets and chain stores and in some cases were being forced to leave the market,"" [i]n its operation … the Act has had the unintended effect of limiting the extent of discounting generally and therefore has likely caused consumers to pay higher prices than they otherwise would. The Commission recommended that ""Congress should repeal the Robinson-Patman Act in its entirety."" Whether the current economic climate will result in a further renewal of efforts to modify or repeal the statute, or whether Congress will determine that statutory intervention is appropriate, is not known at this time.","The Robinson-Patman (R-P) Act, 15 U.S.C. §§ 13, 13a, 13b, 21a, makes it unlawful, with certain exceptions, to knowingly sell goods ""in commerce,"" for use or sale within the United States, at differing prices to contemporaneous buyers of those goods. The ""in commerce"" language of Robinson-Patman has been held to mean that the interstate commerce requirement is satisfied only when at least one of the two (or more) sales is made ""in the stream of commerce""—that is, across state lines. Enacted during the Depression at the behest of small grocers who feared the buying power of large and growing chain grocers, Robinson-Patman is the exception to the notion that the antitrust laws protect competition, not competitors in that it generally prohibits precisely the kind of price differentiation which would normally be thought to result from vigorous competition. Allegations of Robinson-Patman violations may be defended by asserting and proving either that the differing prices reflect only the cost of the seller's manufacture or delivery (the ""cost justification"" defense); or, that the seller is attempting either (1) to meet the competition of another seller, or (2) enable his buyer to meet the competition of a competitor of the buyer (""meeting competition"" defense). In addition, there is also a broad exception to the prohibition against price discrimination when one of the sales is made to any of certain entities listed in the Nonprofit Institutions Act, 15 U.S.C. § 13c, and the goods are purchased for the institution's ""own use""; nonprofits may not, however, take advantage of their privileged Robinson-Patman status to purchase commodities at favorable prices in order to compete commercially with entities not so entitled. Further, lower courts have found that health maintenance organizations (HMOs) qualify as organizations entitled to take advantage of the Nonprofit Institutions Act, on the theory that they perform services that traditionally have been considered as ""charitable""; the Supreme Court has not had occasion to rule on the status of HMOs. Disfavored purchasers who prove a Robinson-Patman violation are not, however, automatically entitled to damages on that account. The Supreme Court has held that since, technically, Robinson-Patman prohibits any price differential whose effect ""may be substantially to lessen competition, (emphasis added),"" not all proven R-P violations actually damage those who prove them: ""[t]o recover treble damages … a plaintiff must … make some showing of actual injury attributable to something the antitrust laws were designed to prevent""—that is, a causal connection between the violation and the injury allegedly suffered. Although there have been some attempts at amending or repealing Robinson-Patman, none has been successful. The Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice has always believed the statute to be inflationary; that it artificially deprives consumers of the advantages of the lower prices that are the aim of the antitrust laws; and that, inter alia, it ""reduces pricing flexibility [and] discourages the development of efficient distribution systems."" Small businesses, and others, have contended, on the other hand, that their survival depends on the prevention of unjustified price differentials. Whether the current economic climate will revive efforts to modify the statute, which has not been enforced by the Department of Justice since its enactment, and has been enforced sporadically by the Federal Trade Commission, is not known.",govreport
"The September 11, 2001, attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon have drawn attention to the security of many institutions, facilities, and systems in the United States, including the nation's water supply and water quality infrastructure. These systems have long been recognized as being potentially vulnerable to terrorist attacks of various types, including physical disruption, bioterrorism/chemical contamination, and cyber attack. Damage or destruction by terrorist attack could disrupt the delivery of vital human services in this country, threatening public health and the environment, or possibly causing loss of life. Further, since most water infrastructure is government-owned, it may serve as a symbolic and political target for some. This report presents an overview of this large and diverse sector, describes security-related actions by the government and private sector since 9/11, and discusses additional policy issues and responses, including congressional interest. The potential for terrorism is not new. In 1941, Federal Bureau of Investigation Director J. Edgar Hoover wrote, ""It has long been recognized that among public utilities, water supply facilities offer a particularly vulnerable point of attack to the foreign agent, due to the strategic position they occupy in keeping the wheels of industry turning and in preserving the health and morale of the American populace."" Water infrastructure systems also are highly linked with other infrastructure systems, especially electric power and transportation, as well as the chemical industry which supplies treatment chemicals, making security of all of them an issue of concern. These types of vulnerable interconnections were evident, for example, during the August 2003 electricity blackout in the Northeast United States: wastewater treatment plants in Cleveland, Detroit, New York, and other locations that lacked backup generation systems lost power and discharged millions of gallons of untreated sewage during the emergency, and power failures at drinking water plants led to boil-water advisories in many communities. Likewise, natural disasters such as the 2005 Gulf Coast hurricanes and 2007 Mississippi River floods caused extensive and costly damage to multiple infrastructure systems—transportation, water, electric power, and telecommunications. Broadly speaking, water infrastructure systems include surface and ground water sources of untreated water for municipal, industrial, agricultural, and household needs; dams, reservoirs, aqueducts, and pipes that contain and transport raw water; treatment facilities that remove contaminants from raw water; finished water reservoirs; systems that distribute water to users; and wastewater collection and treatment facilities. Across the country, these systems comprise approximately 77,000 dams and reservoirs; thousands of miles of pipes, aqueducts, water distribution, and sewer lines; 168,000 public drinking water facilities (many serving as few as 25 customers); and about 16,000 publicly owned wastewater treatment facilities. All of these systems and facilities must be operable 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Ownership and management are both public and private; the federal government has ownership responsibility for hundreds of dams and diversion structures, but the vast majority of the nation's water infrastructure is either privately owned or owned by non-federal units of government. The federal government has built hundreds of water projects, primarily dams and reservoirs for irrigation development and flood control, with municipal and industrial water use as an incidental, self-financed, project purpose. Many of these facilities are critically entwined with the nation's overall water supply, transportation, and electricity infrastructure. The largest federal facilities were built and are managed by the Bureau of Reclamation (Reclamation) of the Department of the Interior and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) of the Department of Defense. Reclamation reservoirs, particularly those along the Colorado River, supply water to millions of people in southern California, Arizona, and Nevada via Reclamation and non-Reclamation aqueducts. Reclamation's inventory of assets includes 471 dams and dikes that create 348 reservoirs with a total storage capacity of 245 million acre-feet of water. Reclamation projects also supply water to 9 million acres of farmland and other municipal and industrial water users in the 17 western states. The Corps operates 276 navigation locks, 11,000 miles of commercial navigation channel, and approximately 1,200 projects of varying types, including 609 dams. It supplies water to thousands of cities, towns, and industries from the 9.5 million acre-feet of water stored in its 116 lakes and reservoirs throughout the country, including service to approximately 1 million residents of the District of Columbia and portions of northern Virginia. The largest Corps and Reclamation facilities also produce enormous amounts of power. For example, Hoover and Glen Canyon dams on the Colorado River represent 23% of the installed electrical capacity of the Bureau of Reclamation's 58 power plants in the West and 7% of the total installed capacity in the Western United States. Similarly, Corps facilities and Reclamation's Grand Coulee Dam on the Columbia River provide 43% of the total installed hydroelectric capacity in the West (25% nationwide). Still, despite its critical involvement in such projects, especially in the West, the federal government is responsible for only about 5% of the dams whose failure could result in loss of life or significant property damage. The remaining dams belong to state or local governments, utilities, and corporate or private owners. A fairly small number of large drinking water and wastewater utilities located primarily in urban areas (about 15% of the systems) provide water services to more than 75% of the U.S. population. Arguably, these systems represent the greatest targets of opportunity for terrorist attacks, while the larger number of small systems that each serve fewer than 10,000 persons are less likely to be perceived as key targets by terrorists who might seek to disrupt water infrastructure systems. However, the more numerous smaller systems also tend to be less protected and, thus, are potentially more vulnerable to attack, whether by vandals or terrorists. A successful attack on even a small system could cause widespread panic, economic impacts, and a loss of public confidence in water supply systems. Attacks resulting in physical destruction to any of these systems could include disruption of operating or distribution system components, power or telecommunications systems, electronic control systems, and actual damage to reservoirs and pumping stations. A loss of flow and pressure would cause problems for customers and would hinder firefighting efforts. Further, destruction of a large dam could result in catastrophic flooding and loss of life. Bioterrorism or chemical attacks could deliver widespread contamination with small amounts of microbiological agents or toxic chemicals, and could endanger the public health of thousands. While some experts believe that risks to water systems actually are small, because it would be difficult to introduce sufficient quantities of agents to cause widespread harm, concern and heightened awareness of potential problems are apparent. Factors that are relevant to a biological agent's potential as a weapon include its stability in a drinking water system, virulence, culturability in the quantity required, and resistance to detection and treatment. Cyber attacks on computer operations can affect an entire infrastructure network, and hacking in water utility systems could result in theft or corruption of information, or denial and disruption of service. Water infrastructure system designers, managers, and operators have long made preparing for extreme events a standard practice. Historically, their focus has been on natural events—major storms, blizzards, and earthquakes—some of which could be predicted hours or longer before they occurred. When considering the risk of manmade threats, operators generally focused on purposeful acts such as vandalism or theft by disgruntled employees or customers, rather than broader malevolent threats by terrorists, domestic or foreign. The events of September 11, 2001, changed this focus. Federal dam operators went on ""high-alert"" immediately following the 9/11 terrorist attacks. Reclamation closed its visitor facilities at Grand Coulee, Hoover, and Glen Canyon dams. Because of potential loss of life and property downstream if breached, security threats are under constant review, and coordination efforts with both the National Guard and local law enforcement officials are ongoing. The Corps temporarily closed all its facilities to visitors immediately after 9/11, although locks and dams remained operational; most closed facilities later re-opened, but security continues to be reassessed. Following a heightened alert issued by the federal government in February 2003, Reclamation implemented additional security measures which remain in effect at dams, powerplants, and other facilities, including limited access to facilities and roads, closure of some visitor centers, and random vehicle inspections. Although officials believe that risks to water and wastewater utilities are small, operators have been under heightened security conditions since 9/11. Local utilities have primary responsibility to assess their vulnerabilities and prioritize them for necessary security improvements. Most (especially in urban areas) have emergency preparedness plans that address issues such as redundancy of operations, public notification, and coordination with law enforcement and emergency response officials. However, many plans were developed to respond to natural disasters, domestic threats such as vandalism, and, in some cases, cyber attacks. Drinking water and wastewater utilities coordinated efforts to prepare for possible Y2K impacts on their computer systems on January 1, 2000, but these efforts focused more on cyber security than physical terrorism concerns. Thus, it was unclear whether previously existing plans incorporate sufficient procedures to address other types of terrorist threats. Utility officials are reluctant to disclose details of their systems or these confidential plans, since doing so might alert terrorists to vulnerabilities. Water supply was one of eight critical infrastructure systems identified in President Clinton's 1998 Presidential Decision Directive 63 (PDD-63) as part of a coordinated national effort to achieve the capability to protect the nation's critical infrastructure from intentional acts that would diminish them. These efforts focused primarily on the 340 large community water supply systems which each serve more than 100,000 persons. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) was identified as the lead federal agency for liaison with the water supply sector. In response, in 2000, EPA established a partnership with the American Metropolitan Water Association (AMWA) and American Water Works Association (AWWA) to jointly undertake measures to safeguard water supplies from terrorist acts. AWWA's Research Foundation contracted with the Department of Energy's Sandia National Laboratory to develop a vulnerability assessment tool for water systems (as an extension of methodology for assessing federal dams). EPA supported a project with the Sandia Lab to pilot test the physical vulnerability assessment tool and develop a cyber vulnerability assessment tool. An Information Sharing and Analysis Center (ISAC) supported by an EPA grant became operational under AMWA's leadership in December 2002. It allows for dissemination of alerts to drinking water and wastewater utilities about potential threats or vulnerabilities to the integrity of their operations that have been detected and viable resolutions to problems. Research on water sector infrastructure protection has been underway for some time. The Department of the Army conducts research in the area of detection and treatment to remove various chemical agents. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has led an effort to produce databases of water distribution systems and to develop assessment tools for evaluating threats posed by the introduction of a biological or chemical agent into a water system. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is developing guidance on potential biological agents and the effects of standard water treatment practices on their persistence. However, in the 2001 report of the President's Commission on Critical Infrastructure Protection, ongoing water sector research was then characterized as a small effort that leaves a number of gaps and shortfalls relative to U.S. water supplies. This report stated that gaps exist in four major areas, concerns that remain relevant and continue to guide policymakers. Threat/vulnerability risk assessments, Identification and characterization of biological and chemical agents, A need to establish a center of excellence to support communities in conducting vulnerability and risk assessment, and Application of information assurance techniques to computerized systems used by water utilities, as well as the oil, gas, and electric sectors, for operational data and control operations. For some time, less attention was focused on protecting wastewater treatment facilities than drinking water systems, perhaps because destruction of them likely represents more of an environmental threat (i.e., by release of untreated sewage) than a direct threat to life or public welfare. Vulnerabilities do exist, however. Large underground collector sewers could be accessed by terrorist groups for purposes of placing destructive devices beneath buildings or city streets. Pipelines can be made into weapons via the introduction of a highly flammable substance such as gasoline through a manhole or inlet. Explosions in the sewers can cause collapse of roads, sidewalks, and adjacent structures and injure and kill people nearby. Damage to a wastewater facility prevents water from being treated and can impact downriver water intakes. Destruction of containers that hold large amounts of chemicals at treatment plants could result in release of toxic chemical agents, such as chlorine gas, which can be deadly to humans if inhaled and, at lower doses, can burn eyes and skin and inflame the lungs. Since the 2001 terrorist attacks, many water and wastewater utilities have switched from using chlorine gas as disinfection to alternatives which are believed to be safer, such as sodium hypochlorite or ultraviolet light. However, some consumer groups remain concerned that many wastewater utilities, including facilities that serve heavily populated areas, continue to use chlorine gas. To prepare for potential accidental releases of hazardous chemicals from their facilities, more than 2,800 wastewater and drinking water utilities, water supply systems, and irrigation systems already are subject to risk management planning requirements under the Clean Air Act. Still, some observers advocate requiring federal standards to ensure that facilities using dangerous chemicals, such as wastewater treatment plants, use the best possible industry practices (practices that are referred to as Inherently Safer Technologies, or ISTs) to reduce hazards. In 2007, the U.S. Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation Board issued a safety bulletin recommending that the Department of Transportation increase regulation of wastewater and drinking water treatment plants and other types of facilities that receive chlorine gas by railcar to require that they install remotely operated emergency isolation devices to unload chlorine railcars, for rapid shutdown in the event of leakage or other failure. In 2006, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) reported on a survey of security measures at 200 of the nation's largest wastewater utilities. GAO found that many have made security improvements since the 2001 terrorist attacks. Most utilities said they had completed, or intended to complete, a plan to conduct some type of security assessment, although there is no federal mandate to do so. More than half of responding facilities indicated they did not use potentially dangerous gaseous chlorine as a wastewater disinfectant. However, the report noted that these utilities have made little effort to address collection system vulnerabilities, due to the technical complexity and expense of securing collection systems that cover large areas and have many access points. Some told GAO investigators that taking other measures, such as converting from gaseous chlorine, took priority over collection system protections. In a 2007 follow-on study, GAO reported that actual and projected capital costs to convert from chlorine gas to alternative disinfection methods range from about $650,000 to just over $13 million. Factors affecting conversion costs included the type of alternative method; the size of the facility; and labor, building, and supply costs, which varied considerably. There are no federal standards or agreed-upon practices within the water infrastructure sector to govern readiness, response to security incidents, and recovery. EPA is not authorized to require water infrastructure systems to implement specific security improvements or meet particular security standards. Efforts to develop voluntary protocols and tools are ongoing since the 2001 terrorist attacks. Wastewater and drinking water utility organizations are implementing computer software and training materials to evaluate vulnerabilities at large, medium, and small utility systems, and EPA has provided some grant assistance to drinking water utilities for vulnerability assessments. Out of funds appropriated in 2002 ( P.L. 107-117 ), EPA awarded grants to nearly 900 large and medium drinking water utilities to conduct vulnerability assessments. EPA also has targeted grants to ""train the trainers,"" delivering technical assistance to organizations such as the Rural Community Assistance Program and the Water Environment Federation that, in turn, can assist and train personnel at thousands of medium and small utilities throughout the country. Rural and small systems also have received support from the U.S. Department of Agriculture. With financial support from EPA, drinking water and wastewater utility and engineering groups developed three security guidance documents, issued in 2004, that cover the physical design of online contaminant monitoring systems, and physical security enhancements of drinking water, wastewater, and stormwater infrastructure systems. The documents provide voluntary guidelines for assisting utilities that have completed vulnerability assessments to mitigate vulnerabilities of their systems through the design, construction, operation, and maintenance of both new and existing systems. Based on the three guidance documents, these groups also have drafted training materials and a set of voluntary standardized best engineering practices that recommend measures to protect water and wastewater infrastructure against a range of threats, including terrorist attacks and other sources of potential harm, such as accidents, chemical contamination, and natural disasters. EPA has taken a number of organizational and planning steps to strengthen water security. The agency created a National Homeland Security Research Center within the Office of Research and Development to develop the scientific foundations and tools that can be used to respond to attacks on water systems. The Center conducts applied research on ways to protect and prevent, mitigate, respond to, and recover from security events. EPA also created a Water Security Division in the Office of Water, taking over activities initiated by a Water Protection Task Force after the 9/11 terrorist attacks. This office provides guidance and tools to utilities as they assess and reduce vulnerabilities of their systems. It trains water utility personnel on security issues, supports the WaterISAC, and implements the agency's comprehensive research plan. In 2004 EPA issued a Water Security Research and Technical Support Action Plan, identifying critical research needs and providing an implementation plan for addressing those needs. A preliminary review of the Research and Action Plan by a panel of the National Research Council identified some gaps, suggested alternative priorities, and noted that the Plan was silent on the financial resources required to complete the research and to implement needed countermeasures to improve water security. Subsequently, in 2007, the National Research Council concluded that EPA has developed useful contaminant information and exposure assessment tools in several key areas, but that other areas, such as physical and cyber security, contingency planning, and wastewater security, have shown weaker or somewhat disjointed progress. An overarching issue is making water security information accessible to those who might need it . GAO has issued two reports discussing how future federal funding can best be spent to improve security at drinking water and wastewater utilities. Both reports are based on the views of subject matter experts identified by GAO. In the drinking water report, specific activities judged by the experts to be most deserving of federal support included physical and technological upgrades, education and training for staff and responders, and strengthening key relationships between water utilities and others such as law enforcement and public health agencies. In the wastewater report, the experts cited the replacement of gaseous chemicals used in the disinfection process with less hazardous alternatives as a key activity deserving of federal funds, along with improving local, state, and regional collaboration, and support facilities' vulnerability assessments. Asked how federal funds should be allocated, both groups of experts favored giving priority to utilities that serve critical assets (such as public health institutions, government, and military bases) and to utilities serving areas with large populations. A key focus of EPA's activities since 2005 has been the Water Sector Initiative. Initially known as WaterSentinel, it is a pilot project that could serve as a model for water utilities throughout the country. Its purpose is to test and demonstrate contamination warning systems at drinking water utilities and municipalities. EPA awarded grants to install and evaluate early warning systems in five cities under this program (Cincinnati, New York, San Francisco, Dallas, and Philadelphia). More broadly, EPA has expanded its security activities in two ways. First, its focus has enlarged from the post-9/11 emphasis on terrorism to an ""all hazards"" approach, emphasizing to water utilities that issues of risk identification and risk reduction also include natural disasters (which were the focus of much of the industry's attention before 2001) and protection of hazardous chemicals. Second, EPA supports the establishment of intrastate mutual aid and assistance agreements, known as Water/Wastewater Agency Response Networks (WARNS), to facilitate flow of personnel and resources during response to emergencies. They are intended to provide mechanisms for establishing emergency contacts and facilitating short-term emergency assistance to restore critical operations. Mutual aid agreements existed in California and Florida before the 2005 Gulf hurricanes, and more formal efforts to establish similar programs in all 50 states followed on those disasters. So far, WARNS have been established in about 20 states, according to EPA. The agency also has developed a variety of guidance documents and other information resources to support drinking water and wastewater utility preparedness, response, and recovery. A Vulnerability Self-Assessment Tool (VSAT), a risk assessment software tool to assist drinking water and wastewater owners and operators in performing security threats and natural hazards risk assessments, as well as updating emergency response plans. A Water Contaminant Information Tool (WCIT), a secure online database with information for federal, state, and local agencies and emergency responders about chemical, biological, and radiochemical contaminants of concern for the water sector. A scenario-based Tabletop Exercise Tool for Water Systems (TTX Tool) that addresses emergency preparedness and response for a number of potential natural hazards and manmade incidents. A Water Health and Economic Analysis Tool (WHEAT) to assist drinking water utilities in quantifying public health impacts, utility financial costs, and regional economic impacts of an adverse event. Currently this two examines two scenarios: release of hazardous gas, or loss of operating assets in a drinking water distribution system. Officials have been reassessing federal infrastructure status and vulnerabilities for several years. The Bureau of Reclamation's site security program is aimed at ensuring protection of Reclamation's 252 high- and significant-hazard dams and facilities and 58 hydroelectric plants. After September 11, Reclamation committed to conducting vulnerability and risk assessments at 280 high-priority facilities. Risk assessments at these facilities were completed between FY2002 and FY2006. These assessments resulted in recommendations now being implemented to enhance security procedures and physical facilities, such as additional security staffing, limited vehicle and visitor access, and coordination with local law enforcement agencies. The Corps implements a facility protection program to detect, protect, and respond to threats to Corps facilities and a dam security program to coordinate security systems for Corps infrastructure. It also implements a national emergency preparedness program which assists civilian governments in responding to all regional/national emergencies, including acts of terrorism. Both agencies participate in the Interagency Committee on Dam Safety (ICODS), which is part of the National Dam Safety Program that is led by FEMA. A 2003 White House report presented a national strategy for protecting the nation's critical infrastructures and identified four water sector initiatives: identify high-priority vulnerabilities and improve site security; improve monitoring and analytic capabilities; improve information exchange and coordinate contingency planning; and work with other sectors to manage unique risks resulting from interdependencies. The strategy was intended to focus national protection priorities, inform resource allocation processes, and be the basis for cooperative public and private protection actions. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS, established in P.L. 107-297 ) has a mandate to coordinate securing the nation's critical infrastructure, including water infrastructure, through partnerships with the public and private sectors. It is responsible for detailed implementation of core elements of the national strategy for protection of critical infrastructures. One of its tasks is to assess infrastructure vulnerabilities, an activity that wastewater and drinking water utilities have been doing since the 9/11 attacks, under their own initiatives and congressional mandates ( P.L. 107-188 ; see "" Legislative Issues "").The legislative reorganization did not transfer Corps or Reclamation responsibilities for security protection of dams and other facilities or EPA's responsibilities to assist drinking water and wastewater utilities. In 2003, President Bush issued Homeland Security Presidential Directive/HSPD-7 which established a national policy for the federal government to identify, prioritize, and protect critical infrastructure as a part of homeland security. The directive called for DHS to integrate all security efforts among federal agencies and to complete a comprehensive national plan for critical infrastructure protection. In 2006, DHS issued a National Infrastructure Protection Plan (NIPP), proposing a framework of partnerships between private industry sectors and the government that would work together to secure the nation's vital resources. For example, EPA would work with water treatment and wastewater systems, while dams would cooperate with DHS. The Department updated the NIPP in February 2009. The plan is intended to provide the unifying structure for the integration of a wide range of efforts for the enhanced protection and resiliency of the nation's critical infrastructure and key resources into a single national program. The Department established the Critical Infrastructure Partnership Advisory Council (CIPAC) to coordinate federal infrastructure protection programs with similar activities of the private sector, and state, local, and tribal governments. In 2004, CIPAC established a Government Coordinating Council (GCC) and non-government coordinating council for each sector. The CIPAC Water Sector Committee includes representatives from both the Water GCC (federal members) and the Water Sector Coordinating Council (WSCC). The WSCC consists of 24 members from state and local agencies, water utilities, and water affinity organizations. In response to the original NIPP, DHS and the GCCs, in conjunction with the Sector Coordinating Councils, prepared 17 sector-specific plans which were completed in 2007. The plans identify sector profiles and assets, assess risks, prioritize infrastructure, identify sector protection plans and measures of progress. The water sector plan for wastewater and drinking water focuses on four goals: (1) sustaining protection of public health and the environment; (2) recognize and reduce risks; (3) maintain a resilient infrastructure; and (4) increase communication, outreach, and public confidence. The sector plan for dams, including federal dams, is one of 10 that DHS determined presents security sensitivity issues if widely distributed; thus, those 10 plans were not released to the public. In an early review of the sector plans, GAO found that the drinking water and wastewater sector plan was more developed than that of many other sectors, largely because the sector has a 30-year history of protection and cooperation, but for that reason, the plan did not provide added value for the sector. In the NIPP, DHS described a plan to develop a risk analysis method that would include a uniform means of measuring risk and assessing consequences across infrastructure sectors. Some drinking water and wastewater treatment industry officials commented that this plan, known as the Risk Analysis and Management for Critical Asset Protection (RAMCAP), raised concern that it could force some facilities to conduct new, or revise existing, vulnerability assessments. Drinking water industry officials are said to be concerned that a new method may not recognize vulnerability assessments that many drinking water utilities have already completed under requirements of the 2002 Bioterrorism Preparedness Act (see "" Legislative Issues ""). This is a particular concern for small and rural utilities, many of which have used simpler security models to complete their vulnerability assessment plans and would prefer to build on that model to conduct RAMCAP and similar activities. While physical security of facilities is a key concern, cyber security issues continue to draw attention, as well. The Water Sector Coordinating Council has developed guidance on protecting potentially vulnerable drinking water and wastewater systems from targeted cyber attack or accidental cyber events and has hosted workshops for utility employees who are responsible for control system security. The Homeland Security Department's involvement in water security concerns has been growing, although under HSPD-7, EPA continues as the lead federal agency to ensure protection of drinking water and wastewater treatment systems from possible terrorist acts and other sabotage. Since early 2004, DHS has been preparing guidance documents on how each infrastructure sector, including water systems, can protect itself from security threats. For some time, the two agencies have been working to clarify their roles in providing security to water utilities. One of the functions of the Water Sector Coordinating Council is to be a point of contact for DHS to vet potential water security policies, allowing one-stop shopping for federal officials. In 2003, DHS created an information-sharing network, called the Homeland Security Information Network (HSIN). Both it and the existing WaterISAC share the goal of providing security information to water utilities, but they differ in some respects. The WaterISAC is a private, subscription service (although it receives some federal funding) that provides information to about 450 water utilities and others on security matters. It is the primary communication tool in the water sector. The HSIN, a software program, is a free, federally funded platform for information sharing. It is not limited to the water sector, and it provides no information by itself; it acts as a bulletin board where DHS, EPA, and utilities can post security-related information. Distinct from the HSIN and the WaterISAC is the Water Security Channel (WaterSC), launched in 2004 as a free service of the WaterISAC, which disseminates EPA and DHS general security bulletins at the request of those agencies to more than 8,400 utilities, state agencies, engineering firms, and researchers. Congress and other policymakers have considered a number of initiatives in this area, including enhanced physical security, communication and coordination, and research. Regarding physical security, a key question is whether protective measures should be focused on the largest water systems and facilities, where risks to the public are greatest, or on all, since small facilities may be more vulnerable. A related question is responsibility for additional steps, because the federal government has direct control over only a limited portion of the water infrastructure sector. The distributed and diverse nature of ownership (federal, non-federal government, and private) complicates assessing and managing risks, as does the reality of limited resources. The adequacy of physical and operational security safeguards is an issue for all in this sector. One possible option for federal facilities (dams and reservoirs maintained by Reclamation and the Corps) is to restrict visitor access, including at adjacent recreational facilities, although such actions could raise objections from the public. Some operators of non-federal facilities and utilities are likewise concerned. As a precaution after the 9/11 attacks, New York City, which provides water to 9 million consumers, closed its reservoirs indefinitely to all fishing, hiking, and boating and blocked access to some roads. Policymakers have examined measures that could improve coordination and exchange of information on vulnerabilities, risks, threats, and responses. This is a key objective of the WaterISAC and also of the Department of Homeland Security, which includes, for example, functions of the National Infrastructure Protection Center (NIPC) of the FBI that brings together the private sector and government agencies at all levels to protect critical infrastructure, especially on cyber issues. One issue of interest is how the Department is coordinating its activities with ongoing security efforts by other federal agencies and non-federal entities that operate water infrastructure systems, including its implementation of the comprehensive national plan required by Presidential Directive/HSPD-7. For some time, the two agencies have been working to clarify their roles in providing security to water utilities and in other areas and have negotiated agreements concerning joint research projects and coordination for specific field operations. Nevertheless, in the conference report accompanying the FY2005 Consolidated Appropriations Act, Congress directed EPA to enter into a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with DHS to define the relationship of the two entities with regard to the protection and security of the nation. The memorandum was expected to specifically identify areas of responsibilities and the potential costs (including which entity pays, in whole or part) for meeting such responsibilities. EPA responded to this directive in November 2005 by issuing a report that identified general authorities that govern EPA's and DHS's respective actions, ongoing projects that reflect coordination, and existing project-specific MOUs. This EPA report on roles and responsibilities still may not resolve the potential for duplication and overlap among agencies. Currently, for example, policies are being developed both by DHS and EPA, although both agencies are represented on DHS's Water Sector Committee through the CIPAC process. Information sharing and dissemination even in this one sector are occurring through several different mechanisms: DHS supports the Homeland Security Information Network (HSIN), while drinking water and wastewater utilities also may receive security-related advisories from two other sources, the WaterISAC and the Water Security Channel. Some have questioned the multiple advisory groups, on top of existing entities, and in particular the potential that the several mechanisms for sharing homeland security information could transmit inconsistent information and make the exchange of information more complicated, not less. Others are optimistic that the systems and groups will sort themselves out into compatible and complementary networks of information sharing, but that process could take considerable time. In its March 2006 report, GAO commented on these multiple information services designed to communicate information to the water sector, but also acknowledged EPA's and DHS's ongoing efforts to coordinate their activities to advance water sector security. GAO recommended that DHS and the Water Sector Coordinating Council identify areas where information-sharing networks supported by EPA and DHS (especially the WaterISAC and HSIN) could be better coordinated to avoid operational duplications and overlap and to ensure that security threat information is provided to water systems on a timely basis. Water utility industry groups responded to GAO's recommendation by saying that such coordination efforts are, in fact, underway. DHS-EPA coordination again received congressional attention in the 110 th Congress. In its draft report on FY2009 funding for DHS, the House Appropriations Committee included report language urging DHS to work with EPA on water security issues. The report encouraged the National Protection and Programs Directorate of DHS to work with EPA ""to improve federal outreach to water system managers, increase support and guidance on implementation of risk assessment techniques, and publicize effective protective measures that can be taken to increase water system security."" Beyond the water sector itself, there is interest in larger coordination issues involving cross-sector interdependencies of critical infrastructures. As noted previously, water utilities are dependent on electric power to treat and distribute power, and electric power is essential to collecting and treating wastewater. Adequate and uninterrupted supply of water is necessary to support municipal firefighting. When disasters occur, what affects power also affects water supply, also affects sanitary services, also affects communications capability. The National Infrastructure Advisory Council, which provides the President, through DHS, with advice on infrastructure security, reportedly is currently engaged in a regional resilience study focused on the Philadelphia region that is examining interdependencies of water and other critical sectors (e.g., energy, telecommunications, transportation). Another information issue concerns the extent of EPA's ability to collect and analyze security data from water utilities, especially information in vulnerability assessments submitted under the Bioterrorism Preparedness Act (discussed below). EPA officials believe that the act permits reviewing utility submissions for overall compliance and allows aggregation of data but precludes the agency from asking for or analyzing data showing changes in security levels, as a safeguard against unintended release of such information. Others, including EPA's Inspector General, believe that EPA has the authority and responsibility to review and analyze the information in order to identify and prioritize threats and to develop plans to protect drinking water supplies. Among the research needs being addressed real-time monitoring of water supplies, and development of information technology. The cost of additional protections and how to pay for them are issues of great interest, and policymakers continue to consider resource needs and how to direct them at public and private sector priorities. A critical issue for drinking water and wastewater utilities is how to pay for physical security improvements, since currently there are no federal funds dedicated to these purposes, and utilities generally must pay for improvements using the same revenue or funding sources also needed for other types of capital projects. Since the September 11, 2001 attacks, Congress has conducted oversight on a number of these issues and considered legislation to address various policy issues, including government reorganization, and additional appropriations. Since the 9/11 terrorist attacks, Congress has provided appropriations to the Corps, the Bureau, and EPA for security-related programs and activities to protect water infrastructure. For both the Bureau of Reclamation and the Army Corps of Engineers, appropriations immediately after 9/11 were intended to support risk assessment of needed security improvements, followed by implementation of measures to ensure the safety and security of the public, Reclamation and Corps employees, and the facilities. For example, since FY2004, both agencies have implemented physical hardening and other protective measures, as well as personnel and information security. Both agencies continue to assess and reassess security needs at their facilities as part of ongoing efforts to ensure their long-term security. Reclamation's security budget includes a law enforcement program (guards and surveillance), facility fortification, studies, and review. For several years, Reclamation's security activities focused on five National Critical Infrastructure (NCI) dam facilities: Hoover, Shasta, Grand Coulee, Glen Canyon, and Fulsom; in recent years, other facilities also have received recommended security upgrades. Physical security enhancements at Reclamation facilities are intended to protect those facilities from terrorist threats, other criminal activities, and unauthorized operation of water control systems, thus reducing the high risk rating at critical assets. Several independent and internal reviews were conduction of Reclamation's site security program (including a review by Sandia National Laboratory, Interior's Office of Inspector General, and the National Academy of Sciences). As a result, Reclamation implemented improvements to all components of its program, including personnel security, information security, facility security, operations security, and law enforcement. The Corps' budget covers recurring security costs (i.e., guards and monitoring) for its administrative buildings and other general use facilities. The Corps also funds certain project-specific facility security upgrades. Funding appropriated to EPA has supported a number of activities. Significant portions of appropriations in FY2002 and FY2003 were for EPA grants for vulnerability assessments carried out by large and medium-size drinking water systems, to assist them in complying with requirements of the Public Health Security and Bioterrorism Preparedness and Response Act ( P.L. 107-188 , discussed below). EPA appropriations also supported training and development of voluntary industry practices for security, and grants to states and territories to coordinate activities for critical water infrastructure security efforts. EPA also provides support for water security information sharing for drinking water and wastewater utilities through the WaterISAC and the Water Security Channel. EPA has supported two special initiatives since FY2006: the Water Alliance for Threat Reduction (WATR), to train utility operators at the highest risk systems; and a related pilot program, the Water Sector Initiative, to design, deploy, and test biological or other contamination warning systems at drinking water. In May 2002, Congress approved the Public Health Security and Bioterrorism Preparedness and Response Act ( P.L. 107-188 ). Title IV of that act required drinking water systems serving more than 3,300 persons to conduct vulnerability analyses and to submit the assessments to EPA. The legislation authorized grant funding to assist utilities in meeting these requirements. Legislation authorizing Reclamation to contract with local law enforcement to protect its facilities also was enacted during the 107 th Congress ( P.L. 107-69 ). In 2001, the House and Senate considered but did not enact legislation authorizing a six-year grant program for research and development on security of water supply and wastewater treatment systems ( H.R. 3178 , S. 1593 ). Some of the drinking water research provisions in these bills were included in the Bioterrorism Preparedness Act. In 2002, the House approved a bill authorizing $220 million in grants and other assistance for vulnerability assessments by wastewater treatment utilities ( H.R. 5169 ), but the Senate did not act on a related bill ( S. 3037 ). In the 108 th Congress, legislation authorizing vulnerability assessment grants to wastewater utilities was approved by the House ( H.R. 866 , identical to H.R. 5169 in the 107 th Congress). The Senate Environment and Public Works Committee approved related legislation ( S. 1039 ). No further action occurred, due in part to concerns expressed by some that the legislation did not require that vulnerability assessments be submitted to EPA, as is the case with drinking water assessments required by the 2002 Bioterrorism Preparedness Act. Wastewater security issues again received some attention in the 109 th Congress. In May 2006, the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee approved S. 2781 , legislation similar to S. 1039 in the 108 th Congress. It would have encouraged wastewater utilities to conduct vulnerability assessments and authorized $220 million to assist utilities with assessments and preparation of site security plans. It also included provisions responding to GAO's March 2006 report that found that utilities have made little effort to address vulnerabilities of collection systems, which may be used by terrorists to introduce hazardous substances or as access points for underground travel to a potential target. S. 2781 would have authorized EPA to conduct research on this topic. During consideration of the bill, the Senate committee rejected an amendment that would have required, rather than encouraged, treatment works to conduct vulnerability assessments and also would have required high-risk facilities to switch from using chlorine and similar hazardous substances to other chemicals that are often referred to as ""inherently safer technologies."" Similar legislation was introduced in the 110 th Congress ( S. 1968 ). In the 111 th Congress, H.R. 2883 , the Wastewater Treatment Works Security Act of 2009, was introduced to require wastewater utilities that use or store substances of concern to carry out assessments and develop site security plans, in compliance with EPA guidelines. The bill would have authorized $1 billion in grants for vulnerability assessments, security enhancements, or worker training programs. No similar bill was introduced in the 112 th Congress. Another issue of interest has been the concerns of a number of water supply and power users of Bureau of Reclamation facilities about paying for security costs at these facilities. Since 9/11, Reclamation has increased security and anti-terrorist measures at federal multi-purpose dams. From 2002 through 2004, all of the incremental security costs were paid by the federal government. However, since 2005, the Administration has requested that users should fully reimburse government for the guards and patrols portion of site security costs. In the Administration's view, project beneficiaries have had several years to adjust their expectations, budgets, and planning for current guard and patrol levels and that post-9/11 cost increases should now be considered project O&M expenses subject to allocation among project purposes and reimbursement from beneficiaries. Many users argued that security costs for which the general public is the beneficiary, including obligations for national defense, should properly be the federal government's responsibility. The issue is especially a concern for beneficiaries of Reclamation's five high-priority dams, such as Hoover and Grand Coulee, which have the largest security needs, because these users are being asked to pay a proportionally higher share of total security costs than users of other Reclamation facilities. Hearings on the issue were held by the House Natural Resources Committee, in June 2006, and the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, in July 2007. A compromise on the issue is reflected in legislation enacted in 2008. Section 513 of the Consolidated Natural Resources Act of 2008 ( P.L. 110-229 ) requires water and power users to pay for the cost of security guards, but sets an $18.9 million cap on the amount to be paid by users, indexed for inflation. Since FY2009, Reclamation's budget has included this annual reimbursability ceiling. The issue of security of wastewater and drinking water utilities also was debated in connection with legislation dealing with chemical manufacturing plant security. During consideration of comprehensive chemical plant security bills during the 109 th Congress, some proposed that water systems (drinking water and wastewater) be included in the legislation because many store or use extremely hazardous substances, such as chlorine gas, that can injure or kill citizens if the chemicals are suddenly released (see page 5 ). However, water system officials argued that the water sector should be excluded, because facilities have already undertaken vulnerability assessments (as required for many drinking water systems under the 2002 Bioterrorism Act, and as many wastewater utilities have done voluntarily). Further, they argued that requirements in the legislation were potentially duplicative of Risk Management Plan provisions in the Clean Air Act, which apply to more than 2,800 of the largest water systems. As part of a bill providing FY2007 appropriations for the Department of Homeland Security, Congress included provisions authorizing DHS to establish risk-based and performance-based security standards at the nation's chemical plants (the Chemical Security Act, Section 550 of P.L. 109-295 ). Under the legislation, chemical plants are required to conduct vulnerability assessment and create and implement site security plans based on identified vulnerabilities. The chemical plant security provisions in P.L. 109-295 agreed to exclude water systems from the new requirements. Implementing regulations were promulgated by DHS in 2007, the Chemical Facility Anti-Terrorism Standards (CFATS). However, under the statute, the temporary DHS rules were scheduled to sunset on September 30, 2009, after three years. At a House Homeland Security Committee oversight hearing in 2007, DHS Assistant Secretary for Infrastructure Protection Bob Stephan said that the water sector's exclusion from the Chemical Security Act created a ""regulatory gap,"" because chemicals that are covered by the act, including chlorine, are found at unregulated wastewater and drinking water facilities, as well as regulated conventional chemical plants. He also said that DHS is reviewing ways to boost safeguards at water utilities that use large amounts of gaseous chlorine. Similarly, in 2008, EPA and DHS officials testified in support of eliminating the current exemption for wastewater and drinking water facilities from chemical security regulations. Water utilities oppose being included in DHS's CFATS rules, arguing that it could lead to costly new mandates. The debate also has raised the issue of federal agency roles and leadership, such as whether EPA should be granted a formal consultative role in development and implementation of DHS chemical security rules. Some were concerned that legislation would create uncertainty about coordination between EPA and DHS and whether EPA's lead role for the water utility sector would be altered. Each Congress since the 110 th has considered legislation to extend and modify P.L. 109-295 , including to make the chemical security standards permanent. Since the CFATS authority in P.L. 109-295 expired in September 2009, Congress has been extending the standards on a year-to-year basis. During this period there have been several competing proposals: to create permanent DHS rules for wastewater and drinking water facilities; or to create permanent DHS security rules for chemical plants and wastewater facilities but exempt drinking water plants; or to require EPA to establish risk-based security rules for drinking water plants and for EPA and DHS to consult on security at co-managed drinking water and wastewater facilities; or to leave the existing exemption in place and designate in statute that EPA is the lead agency for drinking water and wastewater security. Water utilities have urged congressional committees not to create a dual or split regulatory arrangement between two agencies, arguing that EPA has long-standing expertise in water and wastewater security issues. A controversial issue debated in connection with some of these proposals is whether to require facilities that handle chemicals to take action to reduce the consequences of a terrorist attack, such as using different chemicals, or changing to safer processes for their operations—so-called inherently safer technology (IST). Under some proposals, regulated drinking water and wastewater treatment facilities in high-risk categories could be directed by states or EPA to implement methods to reduce the consequences of a chemical release from an intentional act if doing so is feasible, would significantly reduce risk, would not increase interim storage of a substance of concern at the facility, and would not render the facility unable to comply with applicable requirements of the SDWA or CWA. Supporters have said that including water facilities would close a major security gap and would strengthen chemical facility antiterrorism standards and incorporate best practices. Opponents have said that doing so would impose costly mandates while doing little to further security. Water utility officials endorse giving EPA the lead on water security, but oppose any mandate for IST. Legislative proposals addressing these issues in the 112 th Congress included H.R. 901 , approved by the House Homeland Security Committee; H.R. 908 , approved by the House Energy and Commerce Committee; and S. 473 , approved by the Senate Homeland Security and Government Affairs Committee. These bills differed in a number of respects but reflected apparent consensus regarding water utility issues: all of the bills would have preserved the existing exemption from the DHS CFATS program, and none would have mandated inherently safer technology. Further, none would have altered EPA's lead role for the water utility sector. Separate Senate legislation, S. 711 , did include provisions to require inherently safer technology and would have added coverage of wastewater and drinking water facilities in CFATS. None of these bills was enacted by the 112 th Congress. However, a provision of the Continuing Appropriations Act, 2013 ( P.L. 112-175 ) extended authority for the existing CFATS program through March 27, 2013. Since the terrorist attacks of 2001, wastewater and drinking water utilities have been engaged in numerous activities to assess potential vulnerabilities and strengthen facility and system protections. Congressional oversight of this sector's homeland security activities has been limited but could be of interest in the 113 th Congress.","Damage to or destruction of the nation's water supply and water quality infrastructure by terrorist attack or natural disaster could disrupt the delivery of vital human services in this country, threatening public health and the environment, or possibly causing loss of life. Interest in such problems increased after the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks in the United States. Across the country, water infrastructure systems extend over vast areas, and ownership and operation responsibility are both public and private, but are overwhelmingly non-federal. Since the attacks, federal dam operators and local water and wastewater utilities have been under heightened security conditions and are evaluating security plans and measures. There are no federal standards or agreed-upon industry practices within the water infrastructure sector to govern readiness, response to security incidents, and recovery. Efforts to develop protocols and tools are ongoing since the 9/11 terrorist attacks. This report presents an overview of this large and diverse sector, describes security-related actions by the government and private sector since 9/11, and discusses additional policy issues and responses, including congressional interest. Policymakers have been considering a number of initiatives, including enhanced physical security, better communication and coordination, and research. A key issue is how additional protections and resources directed at public and private sector priorities will be funded. In response, Congress has provided some appropriations for security at water infrastructure facilities (to assess and protect federal facilities and support security assessment and risk reduction activities by non-federal facilities) and passed a bill requiring drinking water utilities to conduct security vulnerability assessments (P.L. 107-188). When Congress created the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) in 2002 (P.L. 107-297), it gave DHS responsibilities to coordinate information to secure the nation's critical infrastructure, including the water sector. Under Homeland Security Presidential Directive-7, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is the lead federal agency for protecting drinking water and wastewater utility systems. Recent congressional interest has focused on two legislative issues: (1) security of wastewater utilities, and (2) whether to include water utilities in chemical plant security regulations implemented by DHS. Congress has considered legislation to encourage wastewater treatment works to conduct vulnerability assessments and develop site security plans, but none has been enacted. Congress also has considered legislation to extend DHS's Chemical Facilities Anti-Terrorism Standards and, as part of that debate, whether to preserve an existing exemption for water utilities from chemical facility standards or to include them in the scope of DHS security rules. For now, the exemption from DHS standards remains in place. Since the terrorist attacks of 2001, wastewater and drinking water utilities have been engaged in numerous activities to assess potential vulnerabilities and strengthen facility and system protections. Congressional oversight of this sector's homeland security activities has been limited but could be of interest in the 113th Congress.",govreport
"The federal government currently provides support for career and technical education through the Carl D. Perkins Vocational and Technical Education Act of 1998 (Perkins III; P.L. 105-332 ). The act authorized funding for vocational and technical education through FY2003, although the Congress continued to provide funding under the act through FY2006. The 109 th Congress has passed and the President has signed the Carl D. Perkins Career and Technical Education Improvement Act of 2006 (Perkins IV; P.L. 109-270 ), which reauthorizes and amends the Perkins Act. The House version of the legislation (the Vocational and Technical Education for the Future Act, H.R. 366 ) was introduced on January 26, 2005. On March 17, 2005, the House Committee on Education and the Workforce reported H.R. 366 ( H.Rept. 109-25 ). By a vote of 416 to 9, the House passed H.R. 366 on May 4, 2005. The Senate version of the legislation was introduced as S. 250 on February 1, 2005. The Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP) reported S. 250 on March 9, 2005, without a written committee report. The Senate passed S. 250 by a vote of 99 to 0 on March 10, 2005. The House substituted H.R. 366 for the Senate version of S. 250 and passed S. 250 (House version) on July 12, 2006, without objection. On July 20, 2006, the conferees met and agreed to file the conference report. The conference report ( H.Rept. 109-597 ) was filed on July 25, 2006. The Senate agreed to the conference report by unanimous consent on July 26, 2006. The House, by a vote of 399 to 1, agreed to the conference report on July 29, 2006. The President signed the bill on August 12, 2006, P.L. 109-270 . This report analyzes selected changes that P.L. 109-270 made to Perkins III. It begins with a detailed analysis of changes to funding formulas—both state allotments and within state allocations. Following this discussion, the report analyzes changes in accountability requirements, including changes to the core indicators of performance and data reporting, and related sanctions. Changes to state and local plans and uses of funds are then considered. The next section of the report examines changes made to the tech-prep program. The report concludes with changes made to the general provisions of the bill, most notably with respect to the equitable participation of private school students in career and technical education programs. Table 1 provides a general comparison of some of the key changes made by Perkins IV. Each of these changes is discussed in detail in a subsequent section of this report. It should be noted that the act provides funding to eligible agencies and eligible recipients. An eligible agency is the state board that functions as the sole state agency responsible for the administration or supervision of career and technical education in a specific state. An eligible recipient receives funding from the eligible agency and includes, for example, local educational agencies and public or nonprofit private institutions of higher education that offer career and technical education courses leading to various outcomes, such as an industry-recognized credential. P.L. 109-270 , the Carl D. Perkins Career and Technical Education Improvement Act of 2006, amends and revises the Perkins Act. It authorizes ""such sums as may be necessary"" for FY2007-FY2012 for Perkins Act programs and activities. The act refers to career and technical education (CTE) rather than vocational and technical education. Perkins IV retains the overall purpose of the act, making only technical changes. P.L. 109-270 also retains the overall structure of the Perkins Act. Sections 1 through 9 deal with certain overarching provisions, such as purposes of the act (Section 2), definitions that apply throughout the act (Section 3), and authorization of appropriations (Section 9). Title I of the act authorizes and specifies the central provisions of the act dealing with assistance to states for career and technical education. Title I-A deals with allotments and allocations. Title I-B specifies state provisions. Title I-C details local provisions. Title II of the act authorizes the tech-prep program. Title III contains general provisions related to federal administration of the program (Part A) and state administration (Part B). Section 9 of P.L. 109-270 authorizes appropriations for Title I of the act, except for three sections that have separate authorizations: Section 114, dealing with national activities; Section 117, authorizing funding for tribally controlled postsecondary career and technical institutions; and Section 118, authorizing funds for occupational and employment information. Perkins IV, like previous versions of the act, requires the Secretary of Education (Secretary) to reserve amounts for certain purposes from funds appropriated under Section 9. However, as shown in Table 2 , Perkins IV makes several changes in these reservations to reflect certain changes in the act. The amount reserved for assistance for outlying areas has been reduced from 0.2% of funds appropriated under Section 9 to 0.13%. This reduced percentage reflects the fact that two freely associated states (FASs)—Micronesia and the Marshall Islands—are no longer eligible for Perkins funding because the United States and these FASs have signed an agreement to extend their Compacts of Free Association. In addition, P.L. 109-270 increases the amount of direct grants to outlying areas (Section 115). Under Perkins III, Guam received a direct grant of $500,000 and American Samoa and the Northern Marianas each received direct grants of $190,000. Remaining funds were then distributed to the Pacific Regional Educational Laboratory (PREL), which would make grants to these three outlying areas and to eligible FASs. Under current law, direct grants are $660,000 for Guam and $350,000 each for American Samoa and the Northern Marianas. For the first fiscal year after the enactment of Perkins IV (FY2007), the Secretary distributes remaining funds to PREL as before. In subsequent years, remaining funds are divided equally among the three outlying areas. Finally, Palau receives a direct grant of $160,000 for as long as it is eligible for Perkins funding. As Table 2 illustrates, the percentage reserved for assistance for Indians and Native Hawaiians under Section 116 has not changed. However, the reservation for incentive grants has been repealed. These funds are now distributed to states under the "" State Allotment Formula "" discussed below. Of funds appropriated under Section 9, Perkins IV, slightly more than 98% is allotted to states based on the formula detailed in Section 111. The underlying formula is identical in Perkins III and Perkins IV: Funds are initially allotted based on three population groups (population ages 15 to 19, 20 to 24, and 25 to 65). These initial allotments are adjusted by states' per capita income (PCI), such that states with below average PCIs tend to receive somewhat increased grants, and those with above average PCIs tend to receive somewhat decreased grants. Perkins IV maintains the state allotment formula used under Perkins III unless ""additional funds"" are available above the FY2006 funding level. If funding allotted to states contains no ""additional funds,"" the formula is unchanged. That is, the initial formula factors are applied, subject to the minimum grant provisions and to the provision that holds states harmless at 100% of their FY1998 grant amount. Assuming appropriations are level funded at the FY2006 amount, states with growing populations, such as Arizona and North Carolina, will tend to receive increased grants. States at their FY1998 grant amounts, such as Vermont and Wyoming, will continue to receive those grant amounts. Other states' grants will tend to decline, as funding shifts to states with more rapidly growing populations. P.L. 109-270 modifies the state allotment formula when there are ""additional funds"" above the amount allotted to states for FY2006. ""Additional funds"" are defined as amounts in excess of funds allotted to states for FY2006, plus the amount set-aside for incentive grants for FY2006 and $827,671. These additions to the amount allotted to states in the base year ensure that funds previously reserved for incentive grants and funds previously reserved for outlying areas no longer eligible for funding (the specified dollar amount) are not considered ""additional funds,"" which trigger the formula changes discussed below. Table 3 illustrates how ""additional funds"" would be calculated assuming a 1% overall increase in FY2006 appropriations under Section 9. First the FY2006 state grant amount would be calculated by subtracting the set-asides from the total appropriation ($1.182 billion minus $26.5 million = $1.156 billion), which was the amount allotted by formula to states for FY2006. Next the amount for incentive grants ($6.384 million) and $827,671 are added to the state formula amount. This results in the FY2006 ""base"" amount of $1.163 billion. Any funds in excess of this base amount is defined as new money, which is allotted as described below. In Table 3 , this amount is $1.175 billion (the amount allotted to states by formula) minus $1.163 billion (the FY2006 base amount) which equals $11.631 million (the additional funds). Up to one-third of the ""additional funds"" (about $3.88 million based on the example in Table 3 ) would be allotted to states (except for the Virgin Islands) with FY2006 grants that are less than the minimum grant amount of ½% of the current-year funds allotted to states. Based on the example, these would be states with FY2006 grants less than $5.87 million (i.e., ½% of the amount allotted to states—$1.175 billion), which would be Alaska, Delaware, District of Columbia, Hawaii, Maine, Montana, New Hampshire, North Dakota, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Vermont, and Wyoming. The ""additional funds"" for these ""qualifying"" states would be allotted in proportion to how much below the minimum grant amount of ½% each state's FY2006 grant is. For example, Vermont and Wyoming, with FY2006 grants of $4.2 million, would receive larger amounts of funding than Maine and Rhode Island, which received FY2006 grants of nearly $5.8 million. As a result of this allotment procedure, none of these states could receive more than the minimum grant amount of ½% of the current amount allotted to states. The remaining funds (at least two-thirds of the ""additional funds"" or about $7.75 million based on the above example) would be allotted to the other states based on the underlying formula, except that no state would receive a grant less than its FY1998 grant. The Perkins Act specifics how funds received by states must be allocated with respect to the percentage reserved at the state level and the percentage subsequently distributed to the local level. It also specifies how funds must be distributed at the local level. As under prior law, Section 112 requires states to distribute at least 85% of state grant funds to the local level (i.e., to eligible recipients, such as local educational agencies (LEAs) and community colleges). States may reserve up to 10% of the funds distributed to the local level for eligible recipients in rural areas and in areas with high percentages or high numbers of career and technical education students. States have complete discretion in how much of local funding is distributed for career and technical education at the secondary level versus postsecondary career and technical education. States may reserve up to 5% of their grants (or $250,000 if that amount is greater) for ""administration of the State plan."" P.L. 109-270 continues to require states to match administrative funds ""on a dollar-for-dollar basis."" States may use up to 10% of the state grant for state leadership functions. Perkins IV continues to specify substate formulas for distribution of Perkins grant funds to eligible recipients (Sections 131 and 132). The act does not change the distribution of funds for eligible postsecondary institutions (e.g., community colleges) and consortia of such institutions. Funds continue to be distributed based on each eligible institution's number of Pell grant recipients and recipients of assistance from the Bureau of Indian Affairs. For example, if an eligible institution accounted for 10% of all such recipients among all eligible institutions in a state, that institution would receive 10% of the funds the state set-aside for postsecondary career and technical education. P.L. 109-270 does change the substate formula for distribution of funds for secondary school CTE programs, although this change should have no practical impact. Under prior law, 30% of funds designated for secondary education programs were to be distributed based on school districts' shares of resident population ages 15 to 19; and 70% of funds were to be distributed based on shares of individuals ages 15 to 19 from poor families. The act permitted the Secretary to waive this formula if a state could demonstrate ""that a proposed formula more effectively targets funds on the basis of poverty"" (Section 131(c)(1)). Because population and poverty data for the 15 to 19 age group are not available at the school district level, the Secretary has waived the application of this formula (apparently for all states). Instead, the Secretary has allowed states to use resident population and poverty data for ages 5 to 17, which is available at the school district level because these data are used to allot grants under Title I-A of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA). P.L. 109-270 codifies this procedure in law: 30% of funds designated for secondary education programs is distributed based on school districts' shares of resident population ages 5 to 17; 70% is distributed based on shares of residents ages 5 to 17 who are from poor families. Section 114 of the Perkins Act authorizes certain national programs and activities, such as a national assessment of vocational education, research, and dissemination. Such sums as may be necessary to conduct these activities are authorized for FY2007 through FY2012. Similar to Perkins III, an independent advisory panel advises the Secretary on the evaluation and assessment of CTE programs funded under the act. Perkins IV, however, includes greater specification of membership on the independent advisory panel. The contents of the assessment are similar under Perkins III and Perkins IV, but Perkins IV adds additional requirements. For example, in examining teacher preparation and qualifications, it is recommended that this include whether CTE faculty meet teacher certification or licensing requirements. The evaluation must also consider career and technical education achievement, in addition to academic achievement and employment outcomes. It must also examine the ""extent and success of the integration of rigorous and challenging academic and career and technical education"" and the outcomes of such integration on academic and technical proficiency achievement. The assessment must also determine whether CTE programs are preparing students for employment in occupations in which mathematics and science skills are critical. An interim report on the assessment must be submitted to Congress on or before January 1, 2010. A final report must be submitted on or before July 1, 2011. With respect to the conduct of research, the Secretary shall make a competitive award to a single entity or consortium of entities to establish a single national research center. Under Perkins III, multiple national research centers could be supported. Under Perkins IV, the center's research must focus on conducting scientifically based research and evaluation. This work, among other goals, must address the education, employment and training needs of CTE participants, including special populations. It must also focus on improving the implementation of CTE programs that are ""integrated with coherent and rigorous content aligned with challenging academic standards."" The research and evaluation must also be used to improve the preparation and professional development of CTE staff, including the recruitment and retention of staff. Section 118 of the Perkins Act authorizes the Secretary to provide assistance and funding to state-designated entities that collect and disseminate occupational and employment information. These entities are jointly designated in each state by the Governor and the state agency that oversees career and technical education. Perkins IV adds a state application process that requires the jointly designated state entity to submit an application to the Secretary at the same time the state submits its state plan under Section 122 (see discussion in subsequent section). The application must include information as required by the Secretary, as well as information based on trends provided in accordance with Section 15 of the Wagner-Peyser Act. Perkins IV also alters authorized state-level activities under Section 118. For example, Perkins III states that designated entities must provide programs to assist ""individuals"" to improve career and occupational decision making. Perkins IV changes the language to ""students (and parents, as appropriate)."" A possible impact of such changes would be to target occupation and employment information programs rather than to make such programs available to the population in general. Other changes include an emphasis on preparing relevant staff to provide parents and students with exposure to high skill, high wage, or high demand occupations, and to assist state entities in creating educational resources and training that include information on these types of occupations. In Perkins IV, Congress acted to strengthen and substantially change accountability requirements (Section 113) and the associated sanctions for failing to meet these requirements (Section 123). Highlights of these changes include the following: specifies separate core indicators of performance for the secondary and postsecondary levels; links established between secondary core indicators of performance and ESEA; requires eligible recipients to accept state-adjusted levels of performance or negotiate their own adjusted levels of performance with the eligible agency for each of the core indicators of performance at the secondary and postsecondary levels; requires annual data reported on eligible agencies' and recipients' progress in meeting their core indicators of performance to be disaggregated as required for data reporting under ESEA; requires eligible agencies and recipients to meet at least 90% of an adjusted level of performance for each core indicator of performance, or be required to write an improvement plan; allows the Secretary to withhold only state leadership and administrative funds from eligible agencies that fail to make progress or show improvement, but no longer allows funds withheld to be redistributed to other eligible agencies; and permits eligible agencies to withhold funds from an eligible recipient, but requires the funds be used by the eligible agency to provide services to students who would otherwise have received services from the eligible recipient. Perkins IV establishes six explicit core indicators of performance at the secondary level. Both eligible agencies and eligible recipients are required to establish measures for each of the indicators. Many of the core indicators of performance included in Perkins IV are similar to those required under Perkins III but include several modifications, such as establishing links to ESEA. It should be noted that Perkins was last reauthorized in 1998, prior to the reauthorization of ESEA that included the new requirements of the No Child Left Behind Act. Under Perkins III, eligible agencies were required to include measures of ""student attainment of challenging state established academic ... proficiencies"" in their identification of core indicators of performance. The first core indicator of performance under Perkins IV must measure student attainment of challenging academic content standards and student academic achievement standards. The standards used in this measure must be the ones adopted by the state under Title I-A of the ESEA (Section 1111(b)(1) and (b)(3)). Student attainment of these standards must be based on the state determined levels of proficiency for assessments required under Title I-A of the ESEA in math, language arts, and, beginning with the 2007-2008 school year, science. Similar to Perkins III, the second core indicator of performance must measure student attainment of career and technical skill proficiencies. Unlike Perkins III, however, it does not require the student attainment of ""challenging"" career and technical skill proficiencies. Perkins IV specifies, however, that measures of student attainment may include student achievement on technical assessments that are aligned with industry-recognized standards, if such assessments are available and relevant. The third core indicator of performance is also similar to an indicator included in Perkins III. Eligible agencies must measure student rates of attainment of a secondary school diploma. They must also measure student rates of attainment of a General Education Development (GED) credential or state recognized equivalent for a high school diploma, including alternative standards for individuals with disabilities. States must also measure student rates of attainment of a proficiency credential, certificate, or degree in conjunction with a secondary school diploma, if the state makes this option available to students. Based on the most recent performance data available, only 17 states offered the latter option to students. The fourth core indicator of performance requires eligible agencies to measure student graduation rates as required under Title I-A of the ESEA. Under the ESEA, graduation rates for secondary students are defined as the ""percentage of students who graduate from secondary school with a regular diploma in the standard number of years"" (Section 1111(b)(2)(C)(vi)). Thus, students who take longer than the standard number of years to graduate, earn a GED in lieu of a regular diploma, or earn some type of alternative high school diploma would not be counted as graduates under this measure. Perkins III did not include a similar core indicator of performance. The last two core indicators of performance are nearly identical to those included in Perkins III. The eligible agency must measure student placement in postsecondary education or advanced training, placement in military service, and placement in employment. The eligible agency must also measure student participation in and completion of CTE programs that lead to employment in non-traditional fields. Perkins IV includes five core indicators of performance at the postsecondary level. Both eligible agencies and eligible recipients are required to establish measures for each of the indicators. Several of the core indicators of performance included in Perkins IV are similar to those required under Perkins III. Similar to Perkins III, the first core indicator of performance must measure student attainment of ""challenging"" career and technical skill proficiencies. Perkins IV specifies, however, that measures of this attainment may include student achievement on technical assessments that are aligned with industry-recognized standards, if such assessments are available and relevant. The second and third core indicators of performance focus on completion and retention at the postsecondary level. The second core indicator of performance requires measures of student attainment of an industry-recognized credential, a certificate, or a degree. The third core indicator of performance requires measures of student retention in postsecondary education or transfer to a bachelor's degree program. While Perkins III addressed completion and retention, it was not as specific as Perkins IV. For example, it did not require measures of student transfers. The fourth core indicator of performance, similar to Perkins III, requires measures of student placement in military service or placement or retention in employment. Perkins IV adds placement in apprenticeship programs to the required measures. It also specifies that measures of employment must include student placement in high-skill, high-wage, or high-demand occupations or professions. The final core indicator of performance is identical to the final core indicator of performance at the secondary level. Eligible agencies and recipients must measure student participation in and completion of CTE programs that lead to employment in non-traditional fields. Eligible agencies and eligible recipients are required to negotiate adjusted levels of performance for each of the core indicators for which they will be held responsible. For eligible agencies, this process is essentially identical to the process used under Perkins III. Based on input from eligible recipients, the eligible agency establishes levels of performance for each of the core indicators in its state plan. The eligible agency then negotiates adjusted levels of performance for the core indicators with the Secretary for the first two program years and then reaches agreement prior to the third program year and the fifth program year for adjusted levels of performance for the relevant time period. As under Perkins III, the agreement on the state adjusted levels of performance must take into account the state adjusted levels of performance established by other eligible recipients, while considering the characteristics of the participants served and the specific services offered, as well as the extent to which the levels will promote continuous improvement on the core indicators of performance. Under Perkins IV, eligible recipients will also be required to establish levels of performance for each of the core indicators in their local plans. Eligible recipients have the option of accepting the state adjusted levels of performance as their own or negotiating with the eligible agency to establish new local adjusted levels of performance. If an eligible recipient chooses to negotiate its adjusted levels of performance, the process will mirror the process at the state level. The agreement on the local adjusted levels of performance must take into account the local adjusted levels of performance established by other eligible recipients, while considering the characteristics of the participants served and the specific services offered, as well as the extent to which the levels will promote continuous improvement on the core indicators of performance. Each eligible agency will continue to be required to submit an annual report detailing its progress in meeting its adjusted levels of performance on the core indicators of performance to the Secretary. Perkins IV also requires eligible recipients to submit annual reports describing their progress in meeting their indicators to the eligible agency. Under Perkins IV, eligible agencies and eligible recipients are required to disaggregate the data for each of the indicators of performance, including any additional indicators selected by the eligible agency or recipient, based on the categories of students included in Title I-A of the ESEA for data reporting purposes. That is, data must be disaggregated by race, ethnicity, gender, disability status, migrant status, English proficiency, and status as economically disadvantaged (ESEA, Section 1111(h)(1)(C)(i)). After disaggregating the data, eligible agencies and recipients must identify and quantify any discrepancies or gaps in performance between the specific categories of students and overall student performance. Under Perkins IV, if a state fails to meet at least 90% of an adjusted level of performance for any of the core indicators, it is required to develop and implement a program improvement plan. This plan must give special consideration to performance gaps identified among categories of students. Perkins III required a state to develop and implement a program improvement plan if it failed to meet the state adjusted levels of performance. In practice, this meant that states only had to develop an improvement plan if they missed their adjusted levels of performance in the aggregate (e.g., poor performance in meeting one adjusted level of performance for a core indicator could be compensated for by exceeding the adjusted level of performance for another core indicator). Similar to Perkins III, if the Secretary determines that an eligible agency is not carrying out its state plan appropriately or is not making ""substantial progress"" in meeting the goals of the act, as determined by the state's adjusted levels of performance, the Secretary may provide technical assistance to the eligible agency to implement improvement strategies. If an eligible agency fails to implement a required improvement plan, fails to make any improvement on the indicators that triggered the improvement plan within the first year of implementation of the improvement plan, or fails to meet at least 90% of the state adjusted level of performance for the same core indicator of performance for three consecutive years, the Secretary may, after providing the eligible agency with an opportunity for a hearing, withhold all or a portion of the eligible agency's funding for state leadership and administration. This is a substantial departure from the sanction provisions contained in Perkins III, under which an eligible agency could be sanctioned for failing to meet its state adjusted levels of performance for two or more consecutive years. The Secretary was also permitted to withhold any funds received by the state under this title, including funds that would otherwise be provided to eligible recipients. Perkins IV requires that funds withheld from an eligible agency be used only to provide technical assistance, assist in the development of an improved state improvement plan, or other relevant improvement activities to benefit the state. The Secretary will no longer be permitted to redistribute funds withheld from one eligible agency to other eligible agencies as was possible under Perkins III. Finally, Perkins IV retains the exception included in Perkins III that allows the Secretary to waive financial sanctions due to ""exceptional or uncontrollable circumstances"" or a ""precipitous and unforseen decline"" in the state's financial resources. Under Perkins IV, the requirements for improvement plans and sanctions for eligible recipients are similar to those imposed on eligible agencies. If, after reviewing the eligible recipient's progress in meeting its local adjusted levels of performance, the eligible agency determines that the eligible recipient failed to meet at least 90% of an agreed upon local adjusted level for any of the core indicators of performance, the eligible recipient will be required to develop and implement a program improvement plan. The program improvement plan must provide special consideration to performance gaps identified among categories of students. Under Perkins III, if an eligible agency determined that an eligible recipient was not making substantial progress in achieving the state adjusted levels of performance, the eligible agency was required to assess the educational needs of the eligible recipients, enter into an improvement plan with the eligible recipient, and conduct regular assessments of the eligible recipient's progress in meeting the state adjusted levels of performance. Under Perkins IV, eligible agencies are required to provide technical assistance to eligible recipients failing to meet their responsibilities or make substantial progress in meeting the purposes of the act as determined based on their local adjusted levels of performance. Perkins III did not include specific sanctions to be applied to eligible recipients subsequently failing to show improvement, and no specific sanctions that would result in an eligible recipient losing funding. Perkins IV subjects eligible recipients to similar financial sanctions as imposed on eligible agencies. After providing an opportunity for a hearing, an eligible agency may withhold all or a portion of an eligible recipient's funding if the eligible recipient fails to make any improvement on the indicators that triggered the improvement plan within the first year of implementation of the improvement plan, or fails to meet at least 90% of the state adjusted level of performance for the same core indicator of performance for three consecutive years. Funds withheld must be used to provide services and activities to students in the area that would have otherwise been served by the eligible recipient. Funds may not be redistributed to other eligible agencies. For eligible agencies, both current law and Perkins IV includes an exception to financial sanctions due to exceptional or uncontrollable circumstances. This exception is extended to financial sanctions for eligible recipients. In addition, the eligible agency may opt not to impose sanctions if the small size of the eligible recipient's CTE program affects its performance. Perkins III provided states with flexibility to select performance measures most appropriate for meeting their goals. This resulted in a multitude of definitions and measurement strategies across states, making state-to-state data comparisons virtually impossible. In response, ED awarded a grant for the Performance Measurement Initiative, a project to develop and pilot test new secondary and postsecondary assessment and accountability measures for academic and career and technical programs that build on existing state and local data systems. Perkins IV contains language that may partially address the data comparability issue. It requires that when identifying core indicators of performance and other indicators of performance, states shall, to the extent possible, define the indicators so that they are aligned with similar data collected for other federal and state programs. The usefulness of this requirement, however, may depend upon how it is implemented by states and interpreted by ED. For example, if states rely on definitions used within their states, and these definitions vary from state to state, it may be difficult to obtain comparable data among states. The data comparability issue could also be complicated if some states opt to use federal definitions for measures, while other states use state definitions that do not match the federal definition. As pointed out by ED, however, if the measures of the core indicators of performance selected by each state were valid and reliable, as required by Perkins IV, it would be possible to make comparisons of an individual state's performance from year to year even if the performance of all states could not be compared. To receive funding, all eligible agencies are required to submit a state plan to the Secretary under Section 122. Under Perkins IV, these plans must cover a six-year time period rather than a five-year time period as required under Perkins III. Perkins IV also contains specific transition provisions to provide eligible agencies time to adjust to the new requirements of the law (Section 4). Eligible agencies are permitted to submit a transition plan for the first fiscal year following the enactment of Perkins IV. They will then submit state plans to cover the remaining five years of the authorization. In practice, a timetable for transitioning from the requirements of Perkins III to Perkins IV may resemble the following: April 2007: States submit transition plans to the U.S. Department of Education (ED); 2007-2008 school year: Transition year and baseline data collection; and Summer 2008: Establish adjusted levels of performance (discussed in a subsequent section of the report). In developing the state plan, both Perkins III and Perkins IV require eligible agencies to consult with a variety of interested parties. Perkins IV expands the list of interested parties with whom the eligible agency must consult to include, for example, academic and career and technical education administrators, career guidance and academic counselors, and charter school authorizers. State plans submitted by eligible agencies are required to include specific information. While Perkins IV incorporates many of the same requirements of Perkins III, it modifies several existing requirements and adds several additional requirements. Below is a summary of substantial changes and additions made to the plan contents. Selected key changes are subsequently discussed in greater detail. The state plan must: describe the career and technical programs of study for career and technical content areas that meet specific requirements and how the programs will be developed and implemented; detail how the eligible agency will assist eligible recipients in developing articulation agreements; describe how the eligible agency will publicize career and technical programs of study offered by eligible recipients; include criteria that will be used to determine the extent to which the local plan will promote continuous improvement in academic achievement and technical skill attainment, and identify and address current or emerging occupational opportunities; explain how CTE programs will prepare secondary students, including special populations, to graduate with a diploma; detail how funds will be used to develop or improve CTE courses at the secondary level that will be aligned with the academic content and student achievement standards adopted by the state under ESEA Title I-A, are relevant and challenging at the postsecondary level, and lead to employment in high skill, high wage, or high demand occupations; describe how the eligible agency will ensure that best practices among eligible recipients and tech-prep recipients are shared; detail how academic and career and technical education at the secondary and postsecondary levels will be linked to improve achievement; describe how the eligible agency will report on and evaluate the integration of CTE programs with coherent and rigorous content aligned with state academic standards; describe how professional development will promote the integration of academic content standards and CTE curricula, increase the percentage of teachers meeting licensure or certification requirements, be sustained and of high quality, encourage applied learning, improve instruction for special populations, improve the use of data, and promote integration with professional development activities carried out under Title II of the ESEA and Title II of the Higher Education Act; detail how the recruitment and retention of CTE faculty and the transition to teaching from business and industry will be improved; explain how the transfer of subbaccalaureate CTE students to baccalaureate programs will be facilitated; describe how CTE will be integrated with academics to ensure learning in the core subjects and career and technical subjects; develop a plan for negotiating local adjusted levels of performance; include assurances that the eligible agency will comply with the requirements of the act and its state plan; and describe how data will be reported. Two of the most significant changes include the specification of elements that CTE programs must include and a greater emphasis on academic achievement, particularly evidenced by the links that must be established to academic requirements included in the ESEA. First, CTE programs of study must include both secondary and postsecondary education elements. They must include ""coherent and rigorous content aligned with challenging academic standards and relevant career and technical content in a coordinated, nonduplicative progression of courses"" aligning secondary and postsecondary education. The programs may also include opportunities for dual or concurrent enrollment or other strategies for students to earn postsecondary credits. Finally, the programs must lead to an industry-recognized credential or certificate at the postsecondary level or an associate's or bachelor's degree. The state plan must also discuss how the state will link CTE with requirements included under the ESEA. For example, the plan must specify how funds will be used to improve or develop new CTE courses that are aligned with student academic achievement standards adopted by the state under the ESEA (Section 1111(b)(1)). The eligible agency must also describe how learning in the core academic subjects defined under the ESEA will be ensured. Section 9101(11) of the ESEA defines the core academic subjects as language arts, mathematics, science, foreign languages, civics and government, economics, art, history, and geography. Similar to Perkins III, states will continue to have the option to submit unified plans under the Workforce Investment Act (WIA; P.L. 105-220 , Section 501). Otherwise, under Perkins IV, states not opting to consolidate their basic state grant funding with their tech-prep funding must fulfill the state plan requirements for the basic state grants program and tech-prep by submitting a single state plan. Perkins IV retains many of the same required and permissible uses of state leadership funds as Perkins III with some modifications and adds several new uses of funds (Section 124). For example, eligible agencies will have to use state leadership funds to provide professional development focused on the use of scientifically based research and data to improve instruction. Professional development must be high quality, sustained, and intensive, and should not be based on one-day or short-term training sessions. In addition, professional development programs must support education programs to ensure that teachers and other staff are able to develop a higher level of academic and industry knowledge and skills in CTE and effectively use applied learning. While Perkins IV retains many of the same permissible uses of funds as Perkins III, there are some notable differences. For example, Perkins IV adds new uses of funds for career guidance and academic counseling, facilitating transitions from subbaccalaureate CTE programs to baccalaureate degree granting institutions, developing assessments of technical skills, developing and enhancing data systems, and improving the recruitment and retention of CTE staff and the transition of individuals from business and industry into CTE. Eligible agencies are also permitted to use state leadership funds to award incentive grants to eligible recipients meeting various criteria, such as exceeding local adjusted levels of performance, developing connections between secondary and postsecondary education, integrating coherent and rigorous content that is aligned with academic standards and technical coursework, or having special populations meet local adjusted levels of performance. Incentive grants may also be awarded to eligible recipients that combine funding with other eligible recipients for innovative initiatives. To receive funding, all eligible recipients are required to submit a local plan to the eligible agency under Section 134. These plans must cover the same time period covered in the state plan. Under Perkins IV, state plans must cover a six-year time period rather than a five-year time period as required under Perkins III. Similar to the contents of state plans, Perkins IV retains many of the provisions for local plan content contained in Perkins III with some modifications, including linkages to ESEA provisions. For example, the local plan must describe how the academic and technical skills of students will be improved through the integration of ""coherent and rigorous content aligned with challenging academic standards and relevant career and technical education programs to ensure learning in the core academic subjects"" as defined in the ESEA. Other provisions require the eligible recipient to ensure that CTE students will enroll in rigorous and challenging courses in the core academic subjects, and that professional development will be provided to promote the integration of coherent and rigorous content aligned with challenging academic standards and relevant CTE. The local plan must also describe how the eligible applicant will offer at least one career and technical program of study that meets the requirements of these programs as described in the requirements for the state plan, and how the eligible recipient will improve the recruitment and retention of CTE staff and the transition of individuals from business and industry into CTE. Both required and allowable uses of funds are stipulated for local recipients. Many of the uses of funds included in Perkins IV were previously included in Perkins III but have been modified. Among the required uses of funds, significant changes and new uses of funds include, for example, establishing linkages to the core academic subjects defined under the ESEA, establishing linkages between secondary education CTE and postsecondary CTE, providing training to support the effective integration of challenging academics and CTE, providing training to enable staff to use scientifically based research and data to improve instruction, and providing activities specifically to prepare special populations for high skill, high wage, or high demand occupations leading to self-sufficiency. Several new uses of funds were added to the permissible uses of funds. For example, funds may be used to provide career and academic counseling that improves graduation rates, provides information on postsecondary education and career options, and assists postsecondary students, including adult students. They may be used to establish local education and business partnerships including developing adjunct faculty arrangements for industry professionals and obtaining industry experience for teachers. Funds may also be used to develop initiatives that facilitate the transition of students from subbaccalaureate CTE programs into baccalaureate degree programs, including the development of articulation agreements and dual or concurrent enrollment programs. The local recipient may also use funds to develop new CTE courses and programs of study, including for consideration by the eligible agency; courses that prepare individuals for high skill, high wage, or high demand occupations; and courses that create dual or concurrent enrollment opportunities for secondary education students. Local recipients may also pool their funds with at least one other local recipient to support innovative initiatives, such as improving the initial preparation and professional development of CTE staff or improving accountability data collection or reporting. The provisions for administrative costs are identical under Perkins III and IV. Eligible recipients may use up to 5% of their funds for administrative costs. The tech-prep program is authorized under Title II of the Perkins Act. During congressional consideration of Perkins IV, there was debate about whether tech-prep should be retained as a separate program or integrated into the basic state grants program. The compromise that was reached on this issue allows tech-prep to remain a separate program, but adds new provisions that permit eligible agencies to combine their tech-prep funds with their state grant funds. If eligible agencies choose to combine program funds, funds are considered as being allotted under the basic state grants program and must be distributed to eligible recipients in accordance with the formulas pertaining to that program. All eligible agencies that want to receive tech-prep funding, regardless of whether they choose to consolidate funds or not, must describe in their state plan required under Section 122 how tech-prep activities will be coordinated with other activities described in the state plan. Perkins IV also expands the contents of tech-prep programs and establishes a link between the programs and ESEA. Under Perkins IV, a tech-prep program of study is required to build student competence in technical skills and in the core academic subjects as defined under ESEA, as appropriate, through ""applied, contextual, and integrated instruction, in a coherent sequence of courses."" A tech-prep program of study is also required to integrate academic and career and technical instruction with work-based learning experiences when possible; provide technical preparation in a career field; lead to technical skill proficiency, an industry-recognized credential, a certificate, or a degree in a specific career field; lead to placement in further education or in high skill or high wage employment; and use CTE programs of study, to the extent practicable. Tech-prep programs are also required to use articulation agreements; provide in-service professional development for teachers, faculty, and administrators; and provide professional development on using and accessing data, including student achievement data. Professional development programs for counselors must include a new focus on aiding staff in providing comprehensive career guidance and academic counseling to tech-prep students, including students from special populations. Finally, a tech-prep program must coordinate its activities with activities conducted under Title I of the act. Perkins IV also includes two additional permissible uses of funds. Tech-prep funds may be used to improve career guidance and academic counseling through the use of graduation and career plans. Funds may also be used to develop curricula to aid in transitions between secondary and postsecondary CTE programs. Substantial changes were also made with respect to accountability provisions and associated sanctions. Under Perkins III, tech-prep recipients were not subject to specific accountability requirements or sanctions. Rather, each eligible agency receiving funds was required to report annually to the Secretary on the effectiveness of tech-prep programs. Under Perkins IV, each consortium receiving funding is required to establish and report on the following indicators of performance with respect to tech-prep participants: number of secondary and postsecondary education students served; number and percent of secondary education students who enroll in postsecondary education, enroll in postsecondary education in the same field of study pursued at the secondary level, complete a state or industry-recognized credential or licensure, earn postsecondary credit while enrolled at the secondary level, and enroll in remedial math, writing, or reading courses in postsecondary education; and number and percent of postsecondary education students who are placed in a related field of employment not later than 12 months following graduation from the program, complete a state or industry-recognized credential or licensure, compete a two-year degree or certificate program within the normal time of completion for the program, and complete a bachelor's degree within the normal time of completion for the degree. Each consortium receiving tech-prep funding must enter into an agreement with the eligible agency to meet a minimum level of performance on the aforementioned indicators of performance, as well as on the core indicators of performance established at the secondary and postsecondary levels (see previous discussion). If a consortium does not meet these performance levels for three consecutive years, the eligible agency must require the consortium to resubmit an application for a tech-prep grant. In addition, if grants are made to consortia on a formula basis, the eligible agency may terminate funding to a consortium that fails to meet its performance levels for three consecutive years. Perkins IV authorizes ""such sums as may be necessary"" for FY2007-FY2012 for tech-prep. The tech-prep demonstration program, however, was not reauthorized. The demonstration program was last funded in FY2005 at $4.9 million. Perkins III permitted eligible agencies and eligible recipients to include secondary education staff in nonprofit private schools in the geographical area served by the eligible agency or recipient to participate in vocational and technical education professional development activities (Section 317). Perkins IV modifies this provision to require, ""to the extent practicable, upon written request,"" eligible agencies and eligible recipients to include the aforementioned private school personnel in career and technical education professional development activities upon written request of the private school personnel. Perkins III did not specifically address the issue of the equitable participation of secondary school students enrolled in nonprofit private schools in programs and activities funded under the act, stating only that students were not barred from participation (Section 313). Perkins IV adds new provisions making it optional, upon written request, for eligible recipients to provide for the ""meaningful"" participation of these students in career and technical education programs and activities (Section 317). In addition, upon written request, the eligible recipient must consult ""in a timely and meaningful manner"" with representatives of nonprofit private schools located in the geographical area served by the eligible recipient to discuss the meaningful participation of secondary education students attending these schools in career and technical education programs and activities funded under this act.","The federal government currently provides support for career and technical education through the Carl D. Perkins Vocational and Technical Education Act of 1998 (Perkins III; P.L. 105-332). The act authorized funding for vocational and technical education through FY2003, although the Congress continued to provide funding under the act through FY2006. The 109th Congress has reauthorized the Perkins Act. On August 12, 2006, the Carl D. Perkins Career and Technical Education Improvement Act of 2006 was signed into law (Perkins IV; P.L. 109-270). While many aspects of the Perkins Act remain intact, Perkins IV made several key changes to the act: refers to career and technical education rather than vocational and technical education; retains the basic state grant formula for allocating funds to states if appropriations are level funded or decreasing, but implements a modified formula if appropriations increase; establishes separate core indicators of performance for the secondary and postsecondary levels; modifies the required contents of state and local plans, including adding linkages between the Perkins Act and the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, as modified by the No Child Left Behind Act; requires eligible agencies and eligible recipients to meet at least 90% of their adjusted levels of performance on each of their core indicators of performance or be required to develop and implement an improvement plan; allows the Secretary of Education to withhold only state leadership and administrative funds from eligible agencies that fail to make progress or show improvement, but no longer allows funds withheld to be redistributed to other eligible agencies; permits eligible agencies to withhold funds from eligible recipients failing to make progress or show improvement; modifies the required and allowable uses of state leadership funds; modifies the required and allowable uses of local funds; and maintains the tech-prep program as a separate program, but permits eligible agencies to consolidate their funding under the basic state grants program and the tech-prep program.

"Border and Transportation Security (BTS) is a pivotal function in protecting the Americanpeople from terrorists and their instruments of destruction. While BTS may be difficult to attain, thefederal government has put into place multiple programs and policies to achieve this goal. The threereports in this series attempt to provide an understanding of the complex problems faced in seekingenhanced border and transportation security, suggest a framework to better understand existingprograms and policies, and explore some possible new directions and policy options. As noted in the first report (1) in this series, homeland security efforts can be seen as a series ofconcentric circles or screens, with the outer screen being that of preventive efforts launched outside the country -- before terrorists or their weapons can reach the country. The continuum of activitiesto provide homeland security then moves through progressively smaller circles starting from moredistant efforts to closer and more localized measures, ending with emergency preparedness andresponse. Thus, the process starts with prevention abroad and progresses through the other stagesas needed. As the first report in this series observes, border management is a complex task and currentprograms and policies in place to strengthen the border and facilitate the flow of legitimate peopleand things can seem overwhelmingly complex and difficult to approach in a systematic way. Thisreport addresses the myriad programs and policies that make up the nation's current approach toattaining higher levels of BTS. Before doing so, however, it is useful to review the development ofcongressional concern and policy approaches. Congressional concern with terrorism and border security was manifested early, followinga series of terrorist attacks beginning in the 1990s. The shock of the first World Trade Center attackin 1993 was followed by two attacks in Saudi Arabia (Riyadh in 1995 and Khobar Towers nearDhahran in 1996), the simultaneous Embassy bombings in 1998 (Kenya and Tanzania), the attackon the USS Cole in 2000, and culminating in the catastrophic attack on the World Trade Center andthe Pentagon on September 11, 2001. The congressional response began with inquiries related tothe nature of the terrorist threat, and was followed by specific, targeted measures to protect the nationfollowing the events of 9/11. There are indications that congressional interest continues in broader,more comprehensive approaches including recent efforts to respond to the report of the 9/11Commission contained in the National Intelligence Reform Act of 2004 ( P.L. 108-458 ). Congressional policy evolution is charted briefly below: Broad efforts to understand the terrorist threat -- Starting in 1998, Congresscreated three commissions to better understand the nature of the terrorist threat facing the nation. These included the Gilmore Commission (to investigate domestic preparedness to cope withweapons of mass destruction), the Bremer Commission (to explore the terrorist threat and what couldbe done to prepare for it), and the Hart-Rudman Commission (to investigate national securitychallenges in the 21st Century). (2) Structural changes to provide a proper framework for action -- Following the9/11 attacks, Congress enacted legislation to create the Department of Homeland Security to providea structural framework for subsequent action, and the USA PATRIOT ACT to provide the toolsneeded for the new challenge to national security. (3) Starting even earlier, but continuing through this period, Congressattempted to remedy perceived flaws in the immigration system with a series of legislativemeasures. (4) Highly specific actions to protect against immediate threats -- Understandably, following the 9/11 attacks that were committed by foreign national extremists, early legislativeaction called for the immediate implementation of the entry and exit control system, the use ofbiometric identifiers in travel documents, and intelligence sharing among federal law enforcementand immigration agencies through the passage of the PATRIOT Act. Airline security measures weretaken with the creation of the Transportation Security Administration, among other things in theAviation and Transportation Security Act. That was soon followed by the Enhanced Border Securityand Visa Entry Reform Act to tighten immigration practices and tools, and legislation to protectagainst the serious threats posed in the maritime domain with enactment of the MaritimeTransportation Security Act. (5) Interest in broader, more comprehensive approaches -- As evidenced in recentoversight hearings, Congress has been frustrated by the failure to more aggressively address otherborder and transportation security threats (including the need to create integrated terroristwatch-lists, and measures to address other modes of transportation -- rail and mass transit, air cargo,trucking, and buses). These concerns were given a strong impetus by the Final Report of the 9/11Commission, which highlighted the need for more strategic approaches to the terrorist threat, andare expressed in legislative form in the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004( P.L. 108-458 ). (6) The next section of the report traces the development of selected programs and policiesdesigned to achieve higher levels of border and transportation security, and presents them in aframework that facilitates a better understanding of current approaches and some possible newdirections. Since the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, the nation has made securing the homelandits primary objective. Border security has emerged as a critical stage in achieving this goal. Priorto the terrorist attacks, federal agencies involved in securing the homeland were fragmented andoften plagued by internal performance problems. As discussed below, many federal agencies taskedwith securing the nation's borders did not communicate with one another. Moreover, technology wasinadequate for communications within many of these agencies as well as between agencies. Forexample, immigration systems and databases, which are critical when trying to determine theadmissibility of a foreign national and keep bad people out of the country were not (and to someextent still are not) integrated. In an effort to address some of these issues, Congress passed theHomeland Security Act of 2002 ( P.L. 107-296 ). (7) The Homeland Security Act of 2002 consolidated many of the federal agencies responsiblefor border and transportation security into a single department. Within the Department of HomelandSecurity (DHS) is a Directorate of BTS, which is charged with securing: the borders; territorialwaters; terminals; waterways; and air, land and sea transportation systems of the United States. BTShouses the Bureau of Customs and Border Protection (CBP), the Transportation Security Agency(TSA) and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). Within CBP are the inspections serviceof the former Immigration and Naturalization Services (INS), the U.S. Border Patrol, the inspectionsservice of the U.S. Customs Service, and the border-related inspection programs of the Animal andPlant Health Inspection Service (APHIS). In addition to the border security-related functions of theformer INS and U.S. Customs Service being transferred to CBP, the following agencies were alsotransferred to DHS: (1) U.S. Coast Guard; (2) TSA; and (3) immigration investigations, intelligence,interior enforcement and detention and removal functions of the former INS and U.S. Customsinvestigations and interior enforcement. The Coast Guard was transferred to DHS as a stand-aloneagency and TSA was maintained in DHS' BTS as a distinct entity. (8) This section focuses on current border security activities of CBP, (9) the Coast Guard and the airlinesecurity component of the TSA. The activities discussed in this section are divided into categoriesof how they provide BTS and further divided into people and goods security-related programs. The DHS is the primary federal agency responsible for securing the border. CBP's functionis to secure U.S. borders while facilitating the legitimate flow of people and goods across the border. CBP personnel carry out these duties by inspecting people and goods prior to entry into the UnitedStates and by dispatching border patrol agents to patrol the border between ports of entry to preventpeople from illegally entering the country. In addition to the various components in DHS, the CoastGuard aids in securing U.S. ports and waterways. In securing the ports and waterways, the CoastGuard performs the following functions: (1) defense readiness; (2) drug interdiction; (3) migrantinterdiction; and (4) law enforcement-related functions. (10) Another component of border security is securing the nation'sair system, which is primarily done by TSA. Current policies at the border can be separated into twomajor categories: people-related border security and goods-related border security. Since the terrorist attacks, considerable focus has been placed on the fact that the 19 terroristswere aliens who apparently entered the United States legally despite provisions in immigration lawthat could have barred their admission. (11) Fears that lax enforcement of immigration laws regulating theadmission of foreign nationals into the United States may continue to make the United Statesvulnerable to terrorist attacks have led many to call for tighter measures at the border (as well asduring the screening process for visas). These concerns, which are constantly weighed with effortsto facilitate the legitimate travel of people across the border, have been expressed frequently in alegislative form. (12) The U.S. maritime system consists of more than 300 sea and river ports with more than 3,700cargo and passenger terminals, with most ships calling at U.S. ports being foreign-owned. Containerships have been the focus of much of the attention on seaport security due to the potential ofterrorists infiltrating them. More than 6 million marine containers enter U.S. ports each year andwhile all cargo information is analyzed by CBP officers for possible targeting for closer inspection,only a fraction is actually physically inspected. (13) CBP works in tandem with the U.S. Coast Guard at sea portsof entry. Efforts such as the Coast Guard's requirement that ships provide a 96-hour Notice ofArrival and CBP's Container Security Initiative (CSI) program aid in preventing more harmful thingsfrom getting to the United States. In addition to maritime security, much attention has been focused on the nation's air, truckand rail system. Similar to the massive volume of containers entering the nation's seaports, airportsalso experience large volumes of cargo. The U.S. government has employed a number of strategies and programs to make the nation'sborders more secure. The following actions are set in a framework that suggests types of possiblepolicy actions: Pushing the border outwards to intercept unwanted people or goods before theyreach the United States; Hardening the border through the use of technology and the presence of moreagents at the border; Making the border more accessible for legitimate trade andtravel; Strengthening the border through more effective use of intelligence;and Multiplying effectiveness through the engagement of other actors in theenforcement effort (including engaging Canada, Mexico, state and local law enforcement resources,and the private sector). Many contend that the best way to secure the border is by addressing issues before they reachthe border. While this concept is not new, greater emphasis has been placed on ""pushing the borderout"" since the terrorist attacks. (The following discussion is organized to highlight activities thattarget people and goods for inspection). In 2004, there were more than 427 million travelers who were inspected at a U.S. port ofentry. (15) Of the 427million travelers who sought entry into the United States in 2003, approximately 62% were foreignnationals. While the majority of travelers seeking entry into the United States are admitted duringprimary inspections, (16) a small percentage of travelers (less than one percent) are referred to secondary inspections. (17) In theory, by pushing outthe border, the number of travelers needing closer scrutiny at the border (i.e., referrals to secondaryinspection) would diminish, which would create a higher level of security. Following are a fewexamples of either congressional mandates and/or administrative initiatives that are aimed at pushingout the border. Pre-Inspections. Pre-inspections are immigrationinspections conducted at foreign ports of embarkation by United States authorities for passengersseeking entry into the U.S. Congress first authorized immigration pre-inspections in 1996. (18) However, efforts topreinspect travelers had previously been underway for several years. As of spring 2005, 15 foreignairports participated in the pre-inspection program, (19) and Congress has mandated that preinspections be extended to""at least 25 foreign airports."" (20) Under the pre-inspection program, the Secretary of Homeland Security details immigrationofficers to foreign airports. While immigration officers that are located at pre-inspection sites canperform general inspection functions, other law enforcement functions performed by immigrationofficers within the United States may be limited in the countries where pre-inspection sites arelocated. (21) Although the original intention of pre-inspections was to decrease the number of inadmissiblealiens entering the United States, some officials now view it as a useful means to better secure ourborders while facilitating the flow of travel. Setting up pre-inspection sites at foreign airports,however, is not without controversy. In order to have a pre-inspection site at a foreign airport, theUnited States must enter into diplomatic negotiations with the host country. These negotiationsinclude addressing issues such as sovereignty and the extent to which immigration officers canenforce United States' immigration laws in the foreign country. Another issue in setting uppre-inspection sites at foreign airports is the amount of resources it takes to staff them. Immigrationofficials are assigned to pre-inspection sites based on the volume of travelers seeking entry to theUnited States. Thus, countries that may not have the volume of travelers to justify a pre-inspectionsite may still justify having such a site based on the number of ""high risk"" travelers. Advanced Passenger Manifest. Air carriers enroute to the United States from a foreign country are required to submit passenger manifests inadvance of their arrival at a U.S. port of entry. While inspections are done on U.S. soil, suchadvance notification alerts the CBP inspectors to which travelers will need closer scrutiny. Themanifest is transmitted electronically via the Advanced Passenger Information System (APIS), whichis integrated with the Interagency Border Inspection System (IBIS), a component of the US-VISITprogram. TSA and ICE Border Security-Related Activities. TSA and ICE have several programs that have implications for securing the nation's borders but areusually not considered to be directly applicable to border security. These programs are either gearedtowards pre-screening individuals before they embark on a flight originating in the United States orproviding intervention during a flight should an act of terrorism occur. Computer Aided Passenger Pre-Screening System. Since 1996, the Computer Aided Passenger Pre-screening (CAPPS) System has analyzed ticketpurchasing behavior to identify air travelers who may pose a threat. While the TSA maintains thatthe methods of identifying suspicious passengers under the existing CAPPS program has largelybeen compromised by information publicly discussed following the terrorist attacks, efforts to createa next-generation passenger risk assessment and pre-screening system (CAPPS II) have beenscrapped due to mounting privacy concerns and operational problems. On August 26, 2004,however, TSA announced its plans to test a new passenger pre-screening program, SecureFlight. (22) Under SecureFlight, TSA will be responsible for checking domestic airline passengers' names against terroristwatch lists (see discussion below, ""Strengthening the Border Through More Effective Use ofIntelligence""). (23) The ""No-Fly"" and ""Selectees"" Lists. (24) TSA is mandated by lawto maintain a watchlist of names of individuals suspected of posing ""a risk of air piracy or terrorismor a threat to airline or passenger safety."" The watchlist was created in 1990 and was initiallyadministered by the Federal Bureau of Investigations, then the Federal Aviation Administrationbefore TSA finally took over the administrative responsibility. Individuals whose names are on theselists are subjected to additional security measures, with a ""no-fly"" match requiring the individual tobe detained and questioned by federal law enforcement and a ""selectees"" match requiring additionalscreening. P.L. 108-458 sets forth procedures for appealing erroneous information or determinationsmade by TSA with respect to the aforementioned records. (25) Federal Air Marshal Service. The Federal AirMarshall Service (FAMS) was created as a direct result of the events of the terrorist attacks. It wasoriginally a part of TSA but was moved to ICE by DHS in December 2003. FAMS places plainclothes federal law enforcement agents on board ""high-risk"" flights either destined to the UnitedStates or originating in the United States. In the two-year period following the terrorist attacks, airmarshals responded to over 2,000 aviation security incidents, used non-lethal force 16 times,discharged their weapons on three occasions and were involved in 28 arrests or detainments ofindividuals. (26) In addition to FAMS, other measures to secure passenger airlines include the hardening ofcockpit doors, training and arming pilots who volunteer to be Federal Flight Deck Officers, and thetraining of flight attendants to handle security threats in the aircraft cabin. As discussed above, the massive volume of containers that arrive at U.S. ports each yearmakes it impractical for CBP to inspect every container. In order to focus its limited inspectionresources, CBP has launched several initiatives designed to enhance the targeting of high-riskshipments and securing the entire supply chain from point of origin to final destination. While theseinitiatives assist CBP inspectors with targeting high-risk containers, thus requiring a physicalinspection at the border, they also permit the identification of such containers in advance of theirarrival at the border. Advance Electronic Cargo Manifest Requirement. Cargo inspections are dependent on receiving accurate information in a timely manner in order toexecute risk assessment and targeting procedures before shipments reach the border. To giveinspectors adequate information and time to perform a risk assessment on arriving cargo shipments,the legacy Customs agency published a rule (known as the 24-hour rule) (27) requiring the submissionof certain manifest information to Customs 24-hours in advance of the vessel cargo being laden atthe foreign port. Current law required CBP to develop rules concerning the mandatory electronicsubmission of cargo manifest data. (28) CBP published regulations establishing these rules accordingto the following time-frames: Vessel -- 24 hours prior to lading in the foreign port; Air -- 'wheels up' or four hours prior to departure for the United States(depending upon where the flight originated); Rail -- two hours prior to arrival in the United States; Truck -- one hour prior to arrival for shipments entered through the Pre-ArrivalProcessing System (PAPS) or the Automated Broker Interface (ABI) and 30 minutes prior to arrivalfor shipments entered through FAST. (29) Container Security Initiative. The ContainerSecurity Initiative (CSI) program, one of a series of initiatives aimed at securing the supply chain,was initiated by the U.S. Customs Service (now CBP) in January of 2002 to prevent terrorists fromexploiting containers entering into the United States. CSI is based on four core elements: (1)developing criteria to identify high-risk containers; (2) pre-screening high-risk containers at theearliest possible point in the supply chain; (3) using technology to pre-screen high risk containersquickly; and (4) developing and using smart and secure containers. Under the CSI program, CBPofficers are sent to participating ports where they collaborate with host country customs officers toidentify and pre-screen high-risk containers using non-intrusive inspection technology before thecontainers are laden on U.S.-bound ships. Similar to CBP inspectors who conduct pre-inspectionsat foreign airports, (as discussed above), CBP officers stationed at CSI ports are neither armed, norhave arrest powers. CBP continues to expand CSI to additional foreign ports. As of spring 2005,CSI was at 32 foreign ports. Customs-Trade Partnership Against Terrorism. The Customs-Trade Partnership Against Terrorism (C-TPAT) was initiated in April 2002 and offersimporters expedited processing of cargo if they comply with CBP requirements for securing theirentire supply chain. C-TPAT participants benefit from fewer cargo inspections, as membership inC-TPAT reduces a company's overall risk score in the Automated Targeting System (ATS). (30) In order to participate inthe C-TPAT businesses must sign an agreement that commits them to the following actions: conduct a comprehensive self-assessment of supply chain security using theC-TPAT security guidelines jointly developed by CBP and the tradecommunity; submit a completed supply-chain security profile questionnaire toCBP; develop and implement a program to enhance security throughout the supplychain in accordance with C-TPAT guidelines; and communicate C-TPAT guidelines to other companies in the supply chain andwork toward building the guidelines into relationships with these companies. Once the applicant company has conducted the security self-assessment and submitted thesecurity profile, C-TPAT officials review the security profile to develop an understanding of thecompany's security practices. C-TPAT officials also gather information regarding the company'strade compliance history and any past criminal investigations. Based upon the results of the review,CBP will work with the company to address any security concerns discovered during the review, orwill further reduce the company's risk score. Additional efforts to push the border out include the following (see Appendix A for adescription of each program): Carrier Consultant Program (people); Immigration Security Initiative (people); Known Shipper Programs (goods); and North American Perimeter Security (people). The U.S. northern and southwest borders extend over 6,000 miles, with vast areas of bothborders lacking direct surveillance by border patrol personnel. While the northern border,historically, has posed less of a problem than its southwestern counterpart, the terrorist attacks havebrought attention to the vulnerabilities that both borders pose. The southwest border, on the otherhand, has a longstanding history of illegal migrants attempting to gain entry into the United Statesas well as individuals attempting to smuggle human beings and drugs into the country. The borderpatrol has increased its manpower along portions of the border and various types of technology arealso being used such as video cameras, ground sensors, radiation detectors, geographic informationsystems, and physical barriers to provide surveillance at the border. (31) While critics of the current technological infrastructure contend that its weaknesses pose asecurity risk, efforts are underway to enhance border technology. Issues such as integrating datasystems, sharing intelligence among agencies and departments, having technology that can track thecomings and goings of foreign nationals and having technology that can read biometric identifiersare all important to border management. Additionally, agencies continue to invest in technology that will aid in detecting things thatmay cause harm, including technology that would detect explosives. (32) For example, inspectorsare increasingly using portal scanning devices on commercial vehicles to detect radiation. Theborder patrol has begun using Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) in its Tucson Border Patrol Sectoras part of its Arizona Border Control (ABC) initiative in an attempt to control the flow of illegalmigration between ports of entry. (33) The border patrol also uses other technology such as groundsensors and video cameras. In addition, CBP has deployed an array of non-intrusive inspection (NII) technologies at portsof entry to assist inspectors with the examination of cargos and the identification of contraband. Large scale NII technologies include a number of x-ray and gamma ray systems. The Vehicle andCargo Inspection System (VACIS) uses gamma rays to produce an image of the contents of acontainer for review by the CBP inspector. The VACIS can be deployed in a stationary or mobileconfiguration depending on the needs of the port. CBP has also deployed several rail VACISsystems to screen railcars entering the country. Other large scale NII systems include truck x-raysystems, which like the VACIS can be deployed in a either a stationary or mobile configuration; theMobile Sea Container Examination System, and the Pallet Gamma Ray system. CBP also continuesto deploy nuclear and radiological detection equipment in the form of personal radiation detectors,radiation portal monitors, and radiation isotope detectors at ports of entry. Following are selectedexamples of either congressional mandates and/or administrative initiatives that are aimed athardening the border. In 1996, Congress first mandated that the former INS implement an automated entry and exitdata system (now referred to as the U.S.-VISIT program) that would track the arrival and departureof every alien. (35) Theobjective for an automated entry and exit data system was, in part, to develop a mechanism thatwould be able to track nonimmigrants (36) who overstayed their visas as part of a broader emphasis onimmigration control. Following the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, however, there was amarked shift in priority for implementing an automated entry and exit data system. While thetracking of nonimmigrants who overstayed their visas remained an important goal of the system,border security has become the paramount concern. Tracking the entry and exit of most foreign nationals at U.S. ports of entry is not a smallundertaking. The massive volume of travelers seeking entry into the United States at one of the 300land, air and sea ports of entry coupled with the demands such a system would place on portinfrastructure makes implementing the system challenging. Nonetheless, implementation of theU.S.-VISIT program began at selected air and sea ports on January 5, 2004, and selected land portsof entry on December 31, 2004. Although initially required by Congress in 1996 to curtail the use of fraudulent MexicanBorder Crossing Cards (now referred to as Laser Visas), (37) biometric identifiers have received a great deal of attention post9/11 as the need to positively identify people seeking entry into the United States became paramount. The U.S.-VISIT program, as discussed above, brought national attention to such technology asdiscussion centered around which type of biometrics (i.e., iris scan, fingerprint, facial photograph,etc.) would be best for the program. Under current law, travel documents must have a biometric identifier that is unique to thecardholder. In May 2003, the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) finalized standardsfor biometric identifiers, which asserted that facial recognition is the globally interoperable biometricfor machine readable documents with respect to identifying a person. (38) In an earlier reportpublished by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), it was determined that twofingerprints, as opposed to ten-fingerprints, and a facial photograph ""... are the only biometricsavailable with large enough operational databases for testing at this time."" (39) Although NIST set thetwo-fingerprint standard for identifying one's identity, concern has been raised about the possiblelimitation two-fingerprints pose for obtaining additional information on a person, such as arrestwarrants and criminal history. In an effort to secure the supply chain across international boundaries, CBP and selectvolunteer importers participating in C-TPAT have begun testing a new ""smart container."" Althoughincreasingly sophisticated tools exist, such as bomb sniffers and high-tech locks, many view smartcontainers that are capable of sensing changes in the surrounding environment as a critical meansto prevent crime and terrorism. In theory, ""a smart container would include the means of detectingwhether someone has broken into a sealed container and would have the ability to communicate thatinformation to a shipper or receiver, via satellite or radio."" (40) Under this initiative, CBP provides selected importers with sensors to be secured inside acontainer. The sensors can detect whether or not a container has been entered during transit and willsubmit the information to CBP. The first phase of 'smart box' testing involves volunteer importerswith containers originating in Europe and Asia, moving through U.S. ports in New York-New Jersey,Los Angeles-Long Beach, Seattle and Charleston. (41) Additional efforts to harden the border through the use of technology include the following(see Appendix A for a description of each program): Integration of Data Systems; Integrated Surveillance Intelligence System (ISIS); Operation Safe Commerce; and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV). The facilitation of legitimate cross-border travel and commerce, while still providing foradequate border security, has long been a challenge for policy makers. CBP inherited severalinitiatives aimed at using technology to help speed up the inspection processes for low-risk travelersand goods, which allows CBP inspectors to focus their attention on high-risk situations, as discussedbelow. NEXUS and the Secure Electronic Network for Travelers' Rapid Inspection (SENTRI) areprograms used at land ports of entry to facilitate the speedy passage of low-risk, frequent travelers. NEXUS is located at selected northern ports of entry while SENTRI is located at selected southwestports of entry. Ports of entry are selected based on the following criteria: (1) they have anidentifiable group of low-risk frequent border crossers; (2) the program will not significantly inhibitnormal traffic flow; and (3) there are sufficient CBP staff to perform primary and secondaryinspections. Travelers can participate in the program if: (1) they are citizens or legally permanentresidents of the United States, citizens of Mexico or Canada, or legally permanent residents ofCanada; (2) they have submitted certain documentation and passed a background check; (3) they paya user fee; and (4) they agree to abide by the program rules. (42) Both programs use an electronic identifier (e.g., a proximity card for NEXUS participantsor a radio transponder for SENTRI participants) that triggers an automated system to review theInteragency Border Inspection System (a background check system) and other records related to thevehicle and its designated passengers once the vehicle enters the NEXUS or SENTRI lane. WhileNEXUS and SENTRI lanes are not at all land border crossings, efforts are underway to implementthem at additional land border crossings. The Free and Secure Trade (FAST) program is a joint U.S.- Canada and U.S. - Mexicoinitiative that is aimed at expediting commerce across both the Southwest and the Northern border. FAST offers pre-approved importers, carriers, and registered drivers an expedited processing throughland ports of entry. FAST is available to ""low-risk"" participants who have a demonstrated historyof compliance with relevant legislation and regulations. Importers and carriers must be C-TPAT-certified in order to participate; carriers must also be approved as FAST Highway carriers; anddrivers must possess a FAST Commercial Driver Card. In order for a shipment to be processedacross the border as a FAST shipment, each of the parties involved must be FAST-certified, andless-than-truckload FAST shipments cannot be consolidated with non-FAST shipments and beprocessed through the FAST lanes at the border. While FAST lanes are not at all land bordercrossings, efforts are underway to implement them at additional land border crossings. FAST is alsoan harmonized clearance process, in that it operates in both directions across the Northern border(shipments exported from the United States into Canada can also be processed through the Canadianversion of FAST: Partners in Protection). Additional efforts to make the border more accessible for legitimate travel and trade includethe following (see Appendix A for a description of each program): INS Passenger Accelerated Service System (INSPASS)and I-68 Canadian Border Boat Landing Program / Outlying Area Reporting Station(OARS) In addition to technology used to facilitate legitimate travel and goods across the border byway of a vehicle, DHS also inherited programs designed to facilitate legitimate travel of certaingroups of people. An example of such a program is the Visa Waiver Program, as discussed below,and the Laser Visa (Mexican Border Crossing Card). (See Appendix A for a discussion of the LaserVisa). The VWP allows nationals from certain countries to enter the United States as temporaryvisitors for business or pleasure without first obtaining a visa from a U.S. consulate abroad. (44) By eliminating the visarequirement, this program facilitates international travel and commerce and eases consular officeworkloads abroad, but it also bypasses the first step by which foreign visitors are screened foradmissibility to enter the United States. Travelers under the VWP do not need a visa, and thus nobackground checks are done prior to their arrival at U.S. ports of entry, which allows only oneopportunity -- immigration inspection at the port of entry -- to identify inadmissable aliens. Whilethis program facilitates travel, questions have been raised about the VWP being a potential loopholefor terrorists. Of concern to some is the delay in issuing nationals from the participating countriespassports that contain biometric identifiers, although this concern may have abated since theAdministration is now requiring foreign nationals entering the United States through the VWP to beenrolled in the U.S.-VISIT program. (45) Intelligence plays an essential role in the protection of U.S. national security, one elementof which is to contribute to the protection of U.S. borders. As with traditional foreignintelligence, (47) theprimary role intelligence plays in the context of border security is to provide indications andwarnings to government personnel responsible for border protection -- primarily DHS personnel. Regardless of where the intelligence is collected -- domestically or internationally -- intelligencecontributes to the protection of U.S. borders by seeking to prevent certain goods and individualsfrom crossing U.S. borders. However, as the tragic events of September 11, 2001, demonstrated,even when intelligence systems and mechanisms are in place to prevent individuals with inimicalintent from crossing U.S. borders, it only takes one failure of the intelligence process and/orindividuals involved in it, to contribute to a potential catastrophe. (48) Traditional foreignintelligence as well as criminal intelligence contribute to enhancing border security. At the most basic level, intelligence is designed to find where the danger lies. With respectto protection of the U.S. borders, the primary goal is to collect, analyze and rapidly disseminateintelligence that can deny entry into the United States of terrorists or dangerous material that couldbe used as a weapon by terrorists. With respect to terrorists, one of the most useful tools in thegovernment's counterterrorism arsenal for border protection is the Terrorist Screening Database(TSDB) first compiled by the Terrorist Threat Integration Center. (49) As a testament to therobust role that traditional foreign intelligence entities are playing in the protection of bordersecurity, of the more than 20,000 records in the Terrorist Screening Database in 2004, the CentralIntelligence Agency provided just over 42% of the entries, the State Department provided almost42%, the National Security Agency provided 10%, the Federal Bureau of Investigation almost 4%,and the Defense Intelligence Agency just under 3%. (50) At the sensitive but unclassified (SBU) security level, the TSDBis then shared broadly across the U.S. government, to include agencies such as the DHS, the FederalBureau of Investigation (and the FBI-led Terrorist Screening Center), the Department of Justice-ledForeign Terrorist Tracking Task Force (51) ), the Department of Defense, as well as the Department of State,among others. A ""hit"" on the TSDB will trigger certain protective actions by the law enforcement,intelligence or security personnel having interaction with the individual. With respect to protection against illicit cargo coming into the United States and the potentialfor shipping to be used as a conveyance of weapons of mass destruction, one of the unique toolsbeing used by DHS's CBP is its Automated Targeting System. With shipments into the UnitedStates in the thousands of containers per day, it is not practically or financially feasible to inspecteach container. Building on years of experience in interdicting drugs being shipped into the UnitedStates through cargo containers, DHS's CBP established the interagency-supported NationalTargeting Center (NTC) as a tool to triage and effectively target cargo containers for inspection. Working with the intelligence community and law enforcement community personnel, the NTC'sAutomated Targeting System develops dynamic rules and algorithms which allow it to examine abroad scope of passenger and cargo factors to assign appropriate risk scores. Certain risk scores flaga shipment or container for human inspection. In short, intelligence serves as a force multiplier in contributing to the protection of U.S.borders. It serves the direct purpose of providing advance warnings to alert officials on the frontlines of U.S. borders. However, its indirect use may be equally valuable. That is why domesticintelligence officials, including those at the state and local levels, collect intelligence within theircommunities to put international terrorist activities into a local context. It is also why experts believethere needs to be a wide access to information that may not seem to be relevant in a national context,yet may prove what's happening in Sanaa, Yemen, may be directly or indirectly relevant and valuableto state and local law enforcement and intelligence personnel on the ground. While border security policies may not have received heightened attention until after theterrorists attacks, efforts to improve border management date back to 1995. For example, the UnitedStates and Canadian governments entered into a joint accord on February 24, 1995 called OurShared Border . The 1995 accord brought together five agencies (the former United States INS, theformer U.S. Customs Service, Revenue Canada, Citizenship and Immigration Canada, and the RoyalCanadian Mounted Police) to focus on joint border issues such as enhancing security through moreeffective inspection efforts that target specific problem areas (e.g., drugs, and smugglers), and thecontinued commitment to pool inspection and enforcement resources. And in 1999, the twocountries entered into a partnership, Canada-U.S. Partnership Forum (CUSP). CUSP provided amechanism for the two governments, border communities and stakeholders to discuss issues ofborder management. The guiding principles for U.S.-Canada cooperation resulting from thesedialogues are as follows: Streamline, harmonize and collaborate on border policies andmanagement; Expand cooperation to increase efficiencies in customs, immigration, lawenforcement, and environmental protection at and beyond the border; and Collaborate on common threats from outside the United States andCanada. Current bilateral efforts include a declaration signed on December 12, 2001, by the UnitedStates and Canadian governments establishing a ""smart-border."" The declaration included a 32-pointplan to secure the border and facilitate the flow of low-risk travelers and goods through thefollowing: Coordinated law enforcement operations (i.e., IBETS, see AppendixA ); Intelligence sharing; Infrastructure improvements; The improvement of compatible immigration databases; Visa policy coordination; Common biometric identifiers in certain documentation; Prescreening of air passengers; Joint passenger analysis units; and Improved processing of refugee and asylum claims, among otherthings. On December 3, 2001, the two countries signed a joint statement of cooperation on bordersecurity and migration that focused on detection and prosecution of security threats, the disruptionof illegal migration, and the efficient management of legitimate travel. In March 2002, the United States and Mexico announced a partnership to create a new,technologically advanced ""smart border"" to assure tighter security while facilitating legitimate travel. The U.S.-Mexico Border Partnership Action Plan has 22 points that include greater cooperationbetween the two governments in order to better secure border infrastructure and facilitate the flowof people and goods between the countries. The plan also calls for the development of integratedcomputer databases between the two countries and express lanes at high volume ports of entry forfrequent, pre-cleared low-risk travelers. (53) In addition to the bilateral agreements between the U.S./Canada and the U.S./Mexico, theUnited States has begun working with the European Union (EU) to facilitate cooperation on the CSI,as discussed above. On November 18, 2003, the United States and EU signed an agreement thatwould facilitate such cooperation by establishing an EU-wide container security policy. (54) Figure 1 maps some of the current policy approaches discussed in this report. For example,illustrations of ""pushing the border outward"" in order to intercept unwanted people and goods beforethey reach the United States include CBP's and FDA's advance manifest rules; the Coast Guard's96-hour rule; the CSI; and passenger pre-inspection at foreign airports. Examples of ""making theborder more accessible for legitimate travel and trade"" include the C-TPAT; FAST; and theNEXUS/SENTRI trusted traveler/frequent crosser programs. Examples of ""multiplyingeffectiveness through the engagement of other actors"" include C-TPAT; CSI; FAST; NEXUS; andpassenger pre-inspection. Figure 1. Movement of Goods and People Source: CRS and CRS analysis of OECD figures in Security in Maritime Transport . Note : FPOE = foreign port of exit, and DPOE = domestic port of entry. Balancing security with trade and travel may require a ""layered approach"" to attain bothgoals. The next report in this series, Border and Transportation Security: Possible New Directionsand Policy Options , examines the concept of layering and how it may fit into BTS. The currentprograms and policies in place, however, do reflect some layering. For example, the framework setforth in this report highlights the purposeful overlapping of programs and policies in order to attainBTS. Efforts to push the border outwards are aimed at preempting potential attacks and preventingindividuals who are trying to surreptitiously enter the United States. The various preinspections andadvance passenger/cargo notice programs were developed with this in mind. If someone, however,is able to penetrate the first layer of security then efforts to harden the border are put to the test. Theuse of biometric identifiers in travel documents and smart containers for the shipment of goods areboth examples of how technology is being used to harden the border. In addition to efforts to hardenthe border , the use of intelligence and engaging other actors such as state and local law enforcementand our foreign neighbors are other cumulative measures that have been taken to attain better BTS. While the programs and policies highlighted in this report may reflect an attempt at layering,some contend that there are still gaps in the system. (55) The current programs and policies were either put into place asa result of the 9/11 terrorist attacks or predated the attacks. Those programs and policies that wereput into place as a result of the attacks were done so with a sense of urgency -- to prevent anotherattack . Programs and policies already in existence prior to the attacks, however, were created witha different focus and not necessarily with the goal of keeping terrorists out of the country. As willbe examined in the next report, current efforts to provide a layered approach to BTS would meanapplying some measures of security effort to almost every point of vulnerability or opportunity. As noted earlier, this report is one of a series of three CRS reports that address the issue ofBTS. The first report in the series, CRS Report RL32839 , Border and Transportation Security: TheComplexity of the Challenge , analyzes the reasons why BTS is so difficult to attain. This report isthe second in the series. The final report is CRS Report RL32841 , Border and TransportationSecurity: Possible New Directions and Policy Options . Carrier Consultant Program (CCP). Sometimesreferred to as prescreening, the CCP was originally developed in the former INS. Working withofficials from the Department of State, CBP deploys officers to work with air carriers to preemptattempts to use those carriers to gain illegal entry into the United States using fraudulent documents. In doing so, CCP officials work towards eliminating the arrival of improperly documented aliens ata U.S. port of entry prior to their departure from the foreign port. At domestic airports, CCP officialswork with airlines in identifying any illegal or suspect activity involving the carrier, primarily relatedto the use of fraudulent documents. While the goal of CCP is to reduce illegal migration, theprogram has received heightened attention in this post 9/11 era. I-68 Canadian Border Boat Landing Program/Outlying AreaReporting Station (OARS). The I-68 Canadian Border Boat Landing Programpermits enrolled participants admission to the United States by small pleasure boats without aninspection. The program requires applicants (56) to appear in person for an inspection and interview. During theinspection/interview process, applicants names are checked against the IBIS and biometrics arecollected. Upon approval, participants are issued a boating permit for the season that allows themto enter the United States from Canada without submitting to an inspection. OARS allows travelers of small boats who are not in possession of a valid I-68 form to enterthe United States via Canada without presenting themselves for inspections. Travelers can use oneof the 33 OARS videophone stations upon entry into the United States. (57) The stations are locatedat public marinas along the Canadian border and provide automated inspections through a two-wayvisual and audio communication between the person and the remote inspector. Immigration Security Initiative (ISI). Like CCP,ISI was originally developed in the former INS. CBP is now piloting ISI at several foreign airports. ISI relies on CBP inspectors positioned at foreign airports to intercept people who have beenidentified as national security threats from traveling to the United States ISI has been compared toCBP's CSI, discussed above, which targets high risk containers for inspections. Integrated Border Enforcement Teams (IBETS). IBETs are bi-national, multi-agency law enforcement teams that target cross-border criminal activity. Although IBETS were originally created in 1996 along the British Columbia and Washington stateborder to target cross-border crimes that usually involved illicit drug violations, the terrorist attackshave prompted officials in both countries to expand IBETs role to include counterterrorismmeasures. INS Passenger Accelerated Service System(INSPASS). INSPASS is used at selected international airports. (58) It is a form ofpre-inspections for low-risk, frequent travelers. (59) INSPASS records a biometric geometry (of the hand) for eachenrollee that is verified when the traveler inserts his card. Upon arrival at an airport that hasINSPASS, enrollees proceed to an INSPASS kiosk where they access an automated hand geometryreader. Upon approval by the kiosk, the traveler receives a receipt of his inspection. INSPASSapplicants must enter the United States on certain nonimmigrant visas (60) or under the Visa WaiverProgram. (61) Integration of Data Systems. CBP officials useseveral data systems and databases that assist them with identifying aliens who are potentiallyinadmissible under the Immigration and Nationality Act or otherwise may pose a threat to thecountry. CBP officials also utilize several data systems and databases with respect to identifyinghigh-risk commercial goods that warrant further inspection or review. Of concern are the numerousdata systems and databases that are not integrated or not readily accessible. Critical to the successof border security is the ability to process information in real time. The legacy Customs Service and now CBP have been engaged in a long-term effort todevelop a new automated system to process and track the entry of all goods into the country. TheAutomated Commercial Environment (ACE) will utilize web-based electronic accounts to provideinformation regarding cargo inspections, status of clearance and other information to CBP andaccount users. Integrated Surveillance Intelligence System(ISIS). Along the northern and southwest borders, the border patrol uses ISIS asa surveillance tool. ISIS is comprised of remote video surveillance cameras that are mounted on topof towers, which are remotely monitored. According to CBP, ""one camera uses natural light andtakes traditional video images; the other uses 'infrared' imaging for night vision."" (62) ISIS also consists ofsensors and an Integrated Computer Assisted Detection (ICAD) database. Known Shipper Programs. The TransportationSecurity Administration uses a program that differentiates trusted shippers that are known to a freightforwarder or air carrier through prior business dealings, from unknown shippers. Under such aprogram, shipments from unknown sources are identified and placed under closer scrutiny. (63) Laser Visa (Mexican Border Crossing Card). Mexican nationals applying for admission to the United States as visitors are required to obtain avisa or hold a Mexican Border Crossing Card, now referred to as the ""laser visa."" The laser visa isused by citizens of Mexico to gain short-term entry (up to six months) for business or tourism intothe United States. It may be used for multiple entries and is good for ten years. Under currentpractices, Mexican nationals in possession of a laser visa will be exempt from the requirements ofthe U.S.-VISIT program, thus allowing for a speedy passage into the United States. North American Security Perimeter. As theUnited States moves forward with implementing much of the security requirements in the PATRIOTAct and the Border Security Act, many fear that the tighter security requirements will impede theflow of people across the border. Some critics are advocating for a more open border. The ideal ofa North American Perimeter Security concept has been around for several years and the basicpremise of a North American Perimeter Security would move inspections and enforcement activitiesaway from the border. Such a concept would essentially eliminate barriers to the movement ofpeople (and goods) across the shared border. P.L. 107-173 called for a study to examine thefeasibility of establishing a North American Perimeter Security program that would provide forincreased cooperation with foreign governments on questions related to border security. The NorthAmerican Perimeter Security, however, would require the harmonization of United States andCanadian immigration and refugee policies, among other things. While such a harmonization ofpolicies may be problematic following the events of 9/11, both countries have begun to harmonizeother policies at incremental levels that could be viewed as ""pushing the border out"" (i.e.,preinspections and reverse inspections). Operation Safe Commerce (OSC). OSC is a pilotprogram that brings together private businesses, the maritime industry and the government to analyzesecurity procedures and practices for cargo entering the country and develop improved methods forsecuring the supply chain. OSC's goal is to protect the global supply chain while facilitating the flowof commerce by identifying potential supply chain security weaknesses. Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV). In 2004 DHSlaunched an initiative, dubbed the Arizona Border Control (ABC) Initiative that uses technologysuch as the UAV to increase border surveillance along the Arizona/Mexico border. Currently, theborder patrol is piloting two UAVs along the Arizona and Mexico border.","Border and Transportation Security (BTS) is a pivotal function in protecting the Americanpeople from terrorists and their instruments of destruction. This report addresses selected programsand policies now in place that seek to attain higher levels of BTS. It is the second in a three-partseries of CRS reports that make use of analytical frameworks to better understand complexphenomena and cast them in terms that facilitate consideration of alternative policies and practices. (The first report in the series, CRS Report RL32839 , Border and Transportation Security: TheComplexity of the Challenge , analyzes the reasons why BTS is so difficult to attain. This report isthe second in the series. The final report is CRS Report RL32841 , Border and TransportationSecurity: Possible New Directions and Policy Options .) Congressional concern with terrorism and border security was manifested as early as 1993,with the first World Trade Center attack and subsequent terrorist attacks against U.S. targets abroad. The congressional response to these events began with attempts to understand the nature of theterrorist threat through the creation of several commissions. The response to the 9/11 attacks wasfollowed by specific, targeted measures to protect the nation such as the creation of theTransportation Security Administration and the passage of laws that were aimed at strengtheningsecurity at the border, including immigration policies with respect to the admission of foreignnationals; and strengthening security in the maritime domain. Congressional interest continues inmore comprehensive approaches including recent efforts to respond to the report of the 9/11Commission. There are several broad strategies that could be pursued to enhance border security. Currentprograms and policies can be grouped under the following generic categories, which include pushingthe border outwards to intercept unwanted people or goods before they reach the United States (asin the passenger pre-screening program); hardening the border through the use of technology (asshown by biometric identifiers); making the border more accessible for legitimate trade and travel(as in ""trusted traveler"" programs); strengthening the border inspection process through moreeffective use of intelligence (with the integration of terrorist watch lists); and multiplying theeffectiveness of interdiction programs through the engagement of other actors in the enforcementeffort (as displayed by bi-national accords with Canada and Mexico). It is also possible to use thestrategies as a checklist for what new efforts might be explored. Many current programs and policies to enhance border and transportation security were putinto place as a result of the 9/11 terrorist attacks with a sense of urgency -- to prevent another attack . Programs and policies in existence prior to the attacks, however, were often created with a differentfocus and not necessarily with the terrorist threat in mind. The challenge for Congress is to reviewthese programs and policies comprehensively to help them form a more coherent and effectiveoverall strategy. This report will be updated periodically as events warrant.",govreport
"Across the United States, about 27.5% of state and local government employees (about 6.6 million persons) work in positions that are not covered by Social Security. Coverage rates vary considerably across states. Congress made Social Security coverage mandatory, starting in July 1991, for most state and local government employees who were not already covered by public pension plans. Under current law, public employees who have a pension plan, but who are not covered by Social Security, may hold a referendum on whether to elect Social Security coverage. Once Social Security coverage is provided, it generally cannot be terminated, and all future employees in covered positions are required to participate in Social Security. Proposals to mandate Social Security coverage for all state and local government employees hired in the future have been part of the Social Security policy debate for many years. Under such a proposal, all state and local government positions eventually would be covered by Social Security. This report describes current law, provides some historical background, and discusses some of the potential advantages and disadvantages of mandating Social Security coverage for newly hired state and local government employees from a variety of perspectives. Social Security coverage is extended to state and local government employees through ""Section 218 Agreements"" between a state and the Social Security Administration (SSA). All states, as well as Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, have a voluntary Section 218 Agreement with SSA. A state's Section 218 Agreement details which state and local government positions are covered by Social Security and Medicare. Each state, as well as Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, designates a State Social Security Administrator who is responsible for administering, preparing modifications for, and monitoring coverage of, its subdivisions under the state's Section 218 Agreement. The Administrator, who is a state employee, serves as a bridge between state and local public employers and SSA. Coverage under Section 218 Agreements differs greatly from state to state. For example, within a state, teachers in one county may be covered under Social Security, whereas teachers in the neighboring county may not be covered. The State Social Security Administrator is the main resource for information about Social Security and Medicare coverage and reporting issues for state and local government employers and employees. Section 218 Agreements cover positions, not individuals. If the government position is covered by Social Security and Medicare under a Section 218 Agreement, then any employee (current or future) filling that position is subject to Social Security and Medicare payroll taxes. Coverage is extended to groups of employee positions known as ""coverage groups;"" coverage may not be extended on an individual basis. Various laws and regulations govern how coverage may be extended via employee referendums. All states are authorized to use a majority vote referendum process, and 23 states also are authorized to use a divided vote referendum process created in 1956 (see below). Most often, state governments allow their subdivisions (e.g., a school board) to decide whether to hold a referendum on coverage. Generally, a Section 218 Agreement may be modified to increase, but not reduce, the extent of coverage. With certain exceptions, once Social Security coverage is provided, it cannot be terminated, and all future employees in covered positions are required to participate in Social Security. The 1935 Social Security Act did not extend Social Security coverage to state and local government workers. In 1950, Congress added Section 218 to the Social Security Act to allow all 50 states, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands to elect Social Security coverage for certain state and local government employees. In 1954, Congress extended voluntary coverage to employees who were already covered by pension plans, effective starting in 1955, if a majority of employees who were members of a pension system voted in favor of Social Security coverage. Further amendments in 1956 permitted certain states to split state or local retirement systems into ""divided retirement systems"" based on groups of employees that voted for Social Security coverage and groups of employees that voted against Social Security coverage. Currently, 23 states are authorized to operate a divided retirement system. Until April 1983, public employers could opt in and out of the Social Security program. In 1983, legislation prohibited public employees from withdrawing from the Social Security program once they are in it. The state of California challenged the 1983 law, however the Supreme Court rejected California's arguments. In 1984, Congress extended Social Security coverage to many groups that had not been covered previously, including many state and local government employees, Members of Congress, and federal civilian employees hired on or after January 1, 1984. Until 1984, federal employees were not covered by Social Security, but instead participated in the Civil Service Retirement System. In 1990, Congress made Social Security coverage mandatory, starting in July 1991, for most state and local government employees who are not covered by an alternative public pension plan. Across the United States, about 27.5% of state and local government employees (about 6.6 million persons) work in positions that are not covered by Social Security. Coverage rates vary considerably across the states, as shown in Table 1 . In 26 states, 90% or more of state and local government employees work in positions that are covered by Social Security. In three states, more than 95% of state and local government employees are covered by Social Security: Arizona (95.3%), New York (96.7%), and Vermont (97.9%). In two states, fewer than 5% of state and local government employees work in positions covered by Social Security: Massachusetts (4.1%) and Ohio (2.5%). States in which less than half of state and local government employees are in positions covered by Social Security include California (43.6%), Colorado (29.1%), Louisiana (27.9%), Nevada (17.6%), and Texas (47.9%). About 70% of non-covered state and local government employees reside in seven states: California, Colorado, Illinois, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Ohio, and Texas. Almost half (48.4%) of non-covered state and local government employees reside in three states: California, Texas, and Ohio. Mandatory Social Security coverage of newly hired state and local government employees has been recommended by recent deficit reduction groups. For example, in November 2010, the Bipartisan Policy Center's Debt Reduction Task Force, co-chaired by former Senator Pete Domenici and Dr. Alice Rivlin, recommended that all newly hired state and local government employees be covered under the Social Security system, beginning in 2020, to increase the universality of the program. In addition, the Bipartisan Policy Center recommended that state and local pension plans be required to share data with SSA until the transition is complete. The Bipartisan Policy Center noted that implementation should be delayed until 2020 to give state and local governments time to ""shore up and reform their pension systems"" pointing to the poor fiscal condition of state and local governments and the underfunding of public employee pensions. Similarly, in December 2010, the National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform established by President Obama recommended that all newly hired state and local government employees be covered under the Social Security system beginning in 2021. The commission noted that, as states face prolonged fiscal challenges and an aging workforce, maintaining separate retirement systems (i.e., outside of Social Security) could pose risks for plan sponsors and participants. In the commission's view, mandatory Social Security coverage could mitigate these risks, as well as a potential future bailout risk for the federal government. In addition, the commission recommended that state and local pension plans be required to share data with SSA to improve the coordination of benefits for current workers who spend part of their careers working in state and local government positions. The following discussion highlights some of the issues underlying potential advantages and disadvantages of mandatory Social Security coverage: the financial status of the Social Security system, benefit protections for workers and their families, the impact on states and localities that currently maintain pension systems outside of Social Security, and a broader social perspective. Long-range projections published by the Social Security Board of Trustees in May 2011 show that Social Security expenditures will exceed income by 16% on average over the next 75 years. Stated another way, the projected average 75-year funding shortfall is an amount equal to 2.22% of taxable payroll. The trustees project that Social Security expenditures will exceed total income (tax revenues plus interest income) starting in 2023, and that trust fund assets will be exhausted in 2036. Social Security benefits scheduled under current law can be paid in full until trust fund assets are exhausted (2036). After trust fund exhaustion, annual Social Security revenues are projected to cover about three-fourths of benefit payments scheduled under current law. SSA's Office of the Chief Actuary has estimated the impact of covering newly hired state and local government employees on the Social Security Trust Funds. These estimates are based on the intermediate assumptions of the 2010 Trustees Report, which differ somewhat from the 2011 Trustees Report. Two variations of this option are discussed below—one with an immediate implementation date (2011) and one with a delayed implementation date (2020). As shown in Table 2 , mandatory Social Security coverage for newly hired state and local government employees is projected to have a net positive effect on the Social Security Trust Funds on average over the 75-year projection period. SSA's Office of the Chief Actuary estimates that, if mandatory coverage were implemented in 2011, it would close 9% of the system's projected long-range funding shortfall and extend the projected trust fund exhaustion date to 2040. Similarly, if mandatory coverage were implemented in 2020, it would close 8% of the system's projected long-range funding shortfall and extend the projected trust fund exhaustion date to 2039. Although mandatory coverage is projected to have a net positive effect on the Social Security Trust Funds on average over the 75-year projection period , the greatest positive effect with respect to Social Security's finances would occur during the initial period following implementation. Mandatory coverage of newly hired state and local government employees is projected to result in a net increase in payroll tax revenues to the Social Security system. These payroll tax revenues are credited to the Social Security Trust Funds in the form of special-issue Treasury securities, and as a result of this exchange the revenues become available in the Treasury's general fund for other government operations. A report published by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) in March 2011, Reducing the Deficit: Spending and Revenue Options , provides revenue estimates for an option that would expand Social Security coverage to include all state and local government employees hired after December 31, 2011. This option is projected to increase revenues by about $24 billion over 5 years (2012 to 2016) and $96 billion over 10 years (2012 to 2021). CBO points out that the estimates do not include any effect on outlays during the 2012 to 2021 period, because most state and local government employees that would be hired during this period would not begin receiving benefits for many years. Beyond the 10-year projection window, although this option would increase the number of Social Security beneficiaries, CBO estimates that the additional benefit payments would be about half the size of the additional revenues. Detailed annual estimates are shown in Table 3 . Some observers point out that making Social Security coverage more universal could simplify retirement planning and benefit coordination for workers who divide their careers between state and local government positions and other positions. In addition, they maintain that mandatory Social Security coverage of newly hired state and local government employees would prevent gaps in pension or Social Security coverage, resulting in better retirement, survivor, and disability insurance protections for workers who move between state and local government positions and other positions. For example, under Social Security Disability Insurance, a recency of work test requires the worker to have at least 20 quarters of Social Security coverage in the 40 quarters preceding the onset of disability (generally 5 years of Social Security-covered employment in the last 10 years). Supporters of mandatory coverage also point out that it could result in better benefit protections for workers and their families through the provision of dependents' and survivors' benefits under Social Security. Social Security provides dependents' and survivors' benefits that generally are not available under state and local pension plans. For example, Social Security provides spouses or former spouses a benefit equal to 50% of the worker's basic monthly benefit amount. Most state and local pension plans do not provide benefits for spouses while the worker is alive. In addition, Social Security provides widow(er)s a benefit equal to 100% of the deceased worker's basic monthly benefit amount. Most state and local pension plans provide only modest benefits to young widow(er)s, and provide benefits for widow(er)s at retirement age only if the deceased worker elected a joint-and-survivor annuity option. In addition, supporters point out that mandatory coverage could result in better benefit protections through the provision of full cost-of-living adjustments under Social Security. Although state and local pension plans are more likely than private sector plans to provide inflation protection, state and local pension plans generally cap cost-of-living adjustments at 3%. Some observers point to the current funding status of state and local pension plans and argue that non-covered pensions may be subject to benefit reductions, or contribution increases, in future years. For example, in a recent report, CBO stated: ""By any measure, nearly all state and local pension plans are underfunded, which means that the value of the plans' assets is less than their accrued pension liabilities for current workers and retirees."" Some view the addition of a Social Security benefit component to state and local pension plans as a way to provide better benefit protections for workers whose future non-covered pensions may be at risk. The net effect on a worker's total benefits, however, would depend in part on how state and local governments modify their existing non-covered pension plans in response to mandatory coverage. Opponents argue that mandatory Social Security coverage would not necessarily result in better benefit protections for workers because state and local governments could reduce some pension benefits currently available under non-covered pension plans to keep overall pension costs down. Moreover, Congress could enact changes to the Social Security contribution and benefit structure that result in higher payroll taxes and lower benefits for current workers (compared with current law) in response to Social Security's projected long-range funding shortfall. In addition, state and local government employees tend to be higher-wage workers. According to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), state and local government workers have higher hourly earnings, on average, than the rest of the population. Because Social Security has a progressive benefit formula, higher-wage workers receive lower replacement rates under Social Security compared to lower-wage workers. Therefore, the potential advantages and disadvantages of mandatory Social Security coverage could depend in part on a worker's wage level. Still others who oppose mandatory Social Security coverage maintain that, while Social Security may provide better benefit protections for some workers, others may be better off in a separate retirement system (i.e., outside of Social Security) in which eligibility rules and other plan features are tailored to workers in certain occupations. For example, public pension plans for fire fighters and police officers typically provide full pension benefits at younger ages and with fewer years of service compared to other public pension plans. In contrast to some specialized public pension plans, Social Security retired-worker benefits are available beginning at the age of 62, and benefits claimed before the full retirement age (age 65 to age 67, depending on the person's year of birth) are permanently reduced for early retirement. In addition, Social Security benefits are based on a worker's 35 highest years of earnings in covered employment. If a worker has fewer than 35 years of covered earnings, years with no earnings are counted as zeros in the benefit computation, resulting in a lower initial monthly benefit amount. Some believe that the eligibility requirements under public pension plans for certain categories of workers (e.g., fire fighters and police officers) reflect the circumstances of these occupations, such as physical demands and higher disability rates. The International Association of Fire Fighters (IAFF), for example, opposes mandatory Social Security coverage for non-covered public sector employees. The IAFF points out that an estimated 70% of all fire fighters are covered by pension plans that are separate from Social Security. In a March 2011 document, the IAFF stated that ""Opponents of mandatory coverage believe that forcing all public employees into Social Security—even if it is only new hires—would undermine existing pension systems that provide superior benefits and reflect the unique circumstances of public safety work."" If Congress were to mandate Social Security coverage for all newly hired state and local government employees, as it did for newly hired federal employees in the 1980s, the Federal Employees' Retirement System (FERS) could serve as an example of how to address differences between an existing non-covered pension plan and Social Security with respect to eligibility requirements (retirement age, years of service, etc.) and other features. Under FERS, for example, certain categories of workers, including federal law enforcement officers and fire fighters, accrue benefits at higher rates than other federal employees. In addition, a temporary supplemental benefit is provided under FERS for workers who retire before the age of 62, the earliest age at which a Social Security retired-worker benefit is available. The FERS supplement is available to workers who retire at the age of 55 or older with 30 or more years of service, or at the age of 60 with 20 or more years of service. The FERS supplement, however, is available to law enforcement officers, fire fighters and air traffic controllers who retire at the age of 50 or older with 20 or more years of service. The FERS supplement is equal to the estimated Social Security benefit that the person earned while employed by the federal government, and it is paid only until the person attains the age of 62, regardless of whether the person claims Social Security retired-worker benefits at the age of 62. The portability of state and local pension plans (defined benefit plans) is usually limited to positions that fall within the same public pension system. By contrast, Social Security coverage is portable among most jobs, with the exceptions of non-covered public employment and certain other non-covered positions such as election workers and household workers earning less than an annual threshold amount. Retirement benefits from defined benefit plans are generally based on years of service and final pay. A worker who changes jobs frequently may not stay long enough in a given state or local government position to become vested in the retirement plan. Also, benefit amounts in defined benefit plans are generally based on earnings at the time the worker leaves the job, and many plans do not index earnings at departure for inflation. This may lower benefits significantly for a worker who leaves a state or local government position years before he or she retires from the workforce, or after only a few years of service. Social Security beneficiaries can move from job to job, continue to build years of service and earnings, and all covered earnings are indexed for inflation as part of the benefit computation, regardless of when the worker left covered employment. Under current law, two Social Security provisions affect individuals who are receiving a pension from work that was not covered by Social Security: the windfall elimination provision (WEP) and the government pension offset (GPO). If a worker qualifies for a Social Security retired-worker benefit based on fewer than 30 years of Social Security coverage and is also receiving a pension from work that was not covered by Social Security (a non-covered pension), he or she is subject to the WEP. Under the WEP, the worker's Social Security retirement benefit is computed using the windfall benefit formula, rather than the regular benefit formula, which results in a lower initial monthly benefit. The amount of the reduction in the worker's Social Security retirement benefit under the WEP is phased out for workers with between 21 and 30 years of Social Security-covered employment, and it is limited to one-half the amount of the worker's non-covered pension. The windfall benefit formula is designed to remove the unintended advantage that the regular benefit formula would otherwise provide to a worker who has less than a full career in Social Security-covered employment. The Social Security benefit formula is progressive. That is, it is structured to provide a long-term, low-wage worker with a benefit that replaces a greater percentage of his or her pre-retirement earnings (i.e., a higher replacement rate). The benefit formula, however, does not distinguish between a long-term, low-wage worker and a high-wage worker with a relatively short career in Social Security-covered employment. Both of these workers receive the advantage of Social Security's progressive benefit formula. The windfall benefit formula is designed to remove this unintended advantage for workers who have less than a full career in Social Security-covered employment (sometimes with high wages) because they also worked in non-covered employment and receive a pension based on non-covered work. If a person qualifies for a Social Security spousal benefit and is receiving a non-covered pension, he or she is subject to the GPO. Under the GPO, a person's Social Security spousal benefit is reduced by two-thirds the amount of his or her non-covered pension. The GPO is intended to replicate the dual entitlement rule, which affects persons who qualify for both a Social Security retired-worker benefit and a Social Security spousal benefit. Under the dual entitlement rule, a person's Social Security spousal benefit is reduced by 100% of the amount of his or her Social Security retired-worker benefit. The WEP and the GPO are unpopular provisions of Social Security law among the public and some policymakers. Some observers point out that the way Social Security benefit reductions are computed under the WEP and the GPO seems arbitrary and unfair. Legislation is introduced routinely to modify or repeal these provisions. In terms of administering these provisions, SSA must rely on self-reported data to determine if a person's Social Security retired-worker benefit should be reduced under the WEP, or if a person's Social Security spousal benefit should be reduced under the GPO, and what the Social Security benefit reduction should be under these provisions. In other words, a Social Security claimant or a current Social Security beneficiary must inform SSA that he or she is receiving a non-covered pension, and the amount of the non-covered pension, so that the WEP and the GPO can be applied in the Social Security benefit computation. Proposals have been made over the years to require state and local governments to provide information on their non-covered pension payments to SSA for purposes of administering the WEP and the GPO. President Obama's FY2012 budget request, for example, included up to $50 million for the development of a mechanism for SSA to enforce the WEP and the GPO and estimated that greater enforcement would result in Social Security program savings of almost $3.4 billion over 10 years. Mandatory Social Security coverage of newly hired state and local government employees would eventually eliminate the need for the WEP and the GPO, two provisions of Social Security law that are unpopular among the public and that present administrative difficulties for SSA. Some state and local government pension plans could be affected if newly hired state and local government employees were required to participate in Social Security. In response to mandatory Social Security coverage, employers might change the pension benefits of newly hired public employees to reflect the added Social Security coverage. The basic options for state and local governments include (1) maintaining the current pension structure for newly hired employees; (2) providing a different, presumably lower, benefit structure for newly hired employees within an existing pension plan; (3) closing the existing pension plan to new participants and creating a new pension plan for newly hired employees with a different, presumably lower, benefit structure; and (4) eliminating pension benefits (apart from Social Security) for new hires. Most state and local government workers currently participate in defined benefit (DB) pension plans. In DB pension plans, participants are guaranteed a monthly benefit in retirement that is determined using a formula based on an accrual rate, years of service, and the average of a number of years' final salary. In contrast, many private sector workers are covered by defined contribution (DC) pension plans. In DC pension plans, participants are provided with individual accounts that accumulate employees' (and often employers') contributions and investment returns. Employees use the funds in their accounts as a source of income in retirement. States would have to decide what pension benefits to offer new employees who would be covered by Social Security. Some of the changes that states and localities might consider include lowering the accrual rate for covered workers, increasing the number of high or final years of salary in the benefit formula, altering early retirement benefits, or creating defined contribution pensions. For example, one survey indicated that in 1997 the accrual rate for DB pensions provided to state and local government workers who were participating in Social Security at the time of the survey was 1.84%, compared with an accrual rate of 2.24% for workers who were not participating in Social Security. In some cases, state and local government employers might ""freeze"" their pension plans in which new hires or current employees do not accrue benefits. Plan sponsors have several types of pension freezes available. In a hard freeze, a pension plan is closed to new entrants and current participants cease accruing benefits. In a soft freeze, a pension plan is closed to new entrants but current participants continue to accrue benefits. Frozen pension plans remain subject to Internal Revenue Service rules that apply to state and local government pension plans. Bureau of Labor Statistics data from March 2009 indicated that 10% of state and local government workers who participated in a DB pension plan were in a frozen DB pension plan. The data indicated that 99% of the state and local government workers in frozen plans continued to accrue benefits; that is, the pension plan was a soft freeze. In addition, pension plans for 94% of workers in frozen plans were frozen more than five years prior to the survey, and 95% of the workers in frozen plans were offered a new DB pension plan. None of the workers in frozen DB pension plans were offered a new DC pension plan. Increased costs might come as a result of states operating several pension plans or several benefit structures within a single pension plan. For example, states could decide to offer some combination of DB and DC pension benefits. It could take several years to determine and fully implement the changes. Whether overall costs to employees and governments would increase, decrease, or remain the same depends on the type of pension benefit structure governments adopt in response to mandatory participation in Social Security. Factors that would affect this include the 6.2% Social Security payroll tax paid by employers, the 6.2% Social Security payroll tax paid by employees, the amount of employer contributions to retirement plans, and the amount of employee contributions, if any, to retirement plans. Because the pension benefits (apart from Social Security) that the plans would provide to new employees would likely decrease, pension plan contributions made by employers, and possibly employee contributions, would likely decrease as well. The impact would likely be minimal in plans that have sufficient assets from which to pay 100% of the benefits that participants have accrued. However, the resulting decrease in contributions could add financial strain to pension systems that are currently underfunded and do not have sufficient assets on hand. For example, a plan that is underfunded and ceases to have new participants will find that plan assets will have been used up and that some benefits for some participants do not have a funding source. Sponsors of pension plans that are not fully funded would have to eventually make up for the funding shortfalls that exist within their plans. Although many state and local government pension plans do not have enough assets set aside to pay 100% of promised benefits, participants are not at risk of not receiving their promised benefits in the short or medium term as most pension plans have enough funds set aside to pay benefits for many years. Potential sources of funding to make up for shortfalls include state or local general revenues, increased contributions from current employees, and greater returns on pension plan investments. Currently, many states and localities are facing revenue shortfalls and may be reluctant to set aside funds to cover pension benefits payable several years in the future. It may be difficult or impossible to require increased employee contributions from current employees. Pension plan sponsors may be tempted to increase the riskiness of their investments to capture market gains. However, in the event of a market downturn, riskier pension fund investments would lose value, exacerbating the situation. Unlike private-sector employers, state and local pension plans do not participate in a pension insurance system. Most private-sector employers participate in the Pension Benefit Guarantee Corporation (PBGC), which is a government run insurance company that pays pension benefits to retirees in bankrupt private-sector pension plans. State and local pension plans do not have the opportunity to transfer pension plan liabilities to a PBGC-like entity if they cannot pay benefits. Census Bureau data indicate that in 2007 there were 2,547 state and local pension plans, of which 2,115 responded to a Census Bureau survey of state and local pension plans. As shown in Table 4 , the 2,115 plans that responded to the survey had a total of 18.5 million participants. Although most of these plans (1,897 plans or 89.7%) were local pension plans, statewide plans accounted for more than 90% of plan participants. Some plans were very large; however, most plans had relatively few participants. The average number of participants per plan was 8,755, while the median number of participants per plan was 43. A common measure of the financial health of a DB pension plan is its funding ratio, which measures the adequacy of a DB pension plan's ability to pay promised benefits. The funding ratio is calculated as A funding ratio of 100% indicates that the DB pension plan has set aside enough funds, if the invested funds grow at the expected rate of return or better, to pay all of the benefit obligations. Funding ratios that are less than 100% indicate that the DB pension plan will not be able to meet all of its future benefit obligations. Table 5 details the funding ratios for 122 public pension plans in the Public Pension Plans Database, which was developed by the Center for State and Local Government Excellence and the Center for Retirement Research at Boston College. The pension plans in the database cover approximately 90% of the participants in state and local government pension plans. Funding ratios varied considerably among the pension plans in the database. Among the 122 pension plans for which actuarial information is provided for 2009, the median funding ratio was 77.5%. Some pension plans were well-funded: in 2009, 11 of the 122 pension plans had funding ratios of 100% or greater. Nearly one-third of the pension plans (31.2%), which covered 24.0% of plan participants, had funding ratios of less than 70%. Some argue that mandating Social Security coverage for all public employees would impose significant administrative burdens on state and local governments. State and local governments would have to administer two different systems, one for existing non-covered employees and another for employees who are newly covered by Social Security, until there were no more pensioners under the original pension system. Additional costs would include communicating with employees and actuarial reviews. SSA would also need to administer two systems for a while, one system for covered employees and a second system for remaining beneficiaries with pensions from non-covered employment who are subject to WEP or GPO reductions on their Social Security benefits. State and local governments would need to negotiate extensively with employees and legislatures about the redesign of existing pension systems, in order to adapt existing plans to Social Security coverage. When Congress mandated Social Security coverage for new federal workers in 1983, the federal government enacted a new federal pension plan after three years. GAO has suggested that four years might be required to complete negotiations among legislatures and employee representatives about adapting existing plans to Social Security coverage. Others counter that states and localities already withhold workers' federal income taxes, so the additional administrative costs associated with payroll tax deductions would not be significant. Opponents of mandatory coverage sometimes argue that mandated coverage would raise constitutional issues and might be challenged in court. GAO wrote in 1998, ""we believe that mandatory coverage is likely to be upheld under current U.S. Supreme Court decisions."" ( A discussion of t he potential legal issues associated with mandatory Social Security coverage is beyond the scope of this report. ) Some argue that non-covered state and local government workers should share in providing the poverty reduction that occurs through the Social Security system, which offers disability benefits, dependents' benefits and survivors' benefits, in addition to retirement benefits. In June 2011, retired workers and their dependents accounted for 73% of total benefits paid. The remaining 27% was paid to disabled workers and their dependents (16% of total benefits paid) and to the survivors of deceased workers (11% of total benefits paid). Social Security also redistributes income from workers with higher lifetime earnings to workers with lower lifetime earnings. According to data from BLS, state and local government workers have higher hourly earnings, on average, than the rest of the population. To the extent that state and local government workers do not participate in Social Security, they do not share in providing the poverty reduction that occurs through Social Security. This places an extra burden on higher-earning workers within the Social Security system. According to the 1994-1996 Advisory Council on Social Security, ""an effective Social Security program helps to reduce public costs for relief and assistance, which, in turn, means lower general taxes. There is an element of unfairness in a situation where ... a few benefit both directly and indirectly, but are excused from contributing to the program."" A related argument is that non-covered workers do not share the ongoing costs related to the start-up of the Social Security program. When Social Security was created, the first beneficiaries—often the parents and grandparents of current state and local government employees—paid into the system for a short period and received benefits far in excess of their contributions. About 25% of today's Social Security payroll tax revenues (about 3 percentage points of the current 12.4% payroll tax) go to cover the implicit interest costs of these net transfers to the first beneficiaries. Non-covered workers do not share in these costs, which are sometimes known as ""legacy costs."" In addition, as noted above, CBO projects that mandatory Social Security coverage would increase the number of Social Security beneficiaries in the long term, though the additional benefit payments would be about half the size of the additional revenues. The reason, as explained by CBO, is that most of the newly hired state and local government employees would receive Social Security benefits under current law because they may have held other covered jobs in the past or they were covered by a spouse's employment. Supporters of mandatory Social Security coverage argue that, if most non-covered state and local government employees will qualify for Social Security benefits under current law based on a second job or a spouse's employment, they should be required to pay into the Social Security system throughout their careers. Opponents of mandatory coverage maintain that Social Security benefit reductions under the WEP and the GPO already take into account that some workers participate in alternative public pension plans that operate outside of Social Security. Opponents argue that Social Security coverage has been available to state and local governments since the early 1950s. Thus, many states and localities have had the opportunity to weigh the pros and cons of Social Security coverage. States and localities that have chosen not to participate in the Social Security system would likely view mandatory Social Security coverage as unfair. The majority of state and local government employees are covered by Social Security (72.5% in 2008). Proposals to mandate Social Security coverage for all state and local government employees hired in the future have been part of the Social Security policy debate for many years. The underlying issues to consider in evaluating the potential advantages and disadvantages of mandatory Social Security coverage include Social Security's long-range financial status; benefit protections for workers and their families; the impact on states and localities that would be required to revise their public pension plans to incorporate a Social Security component; and a broader social perspective. ","Social Security covers about 94% of all workers in the United States. Most of the remaining 6% of non-covered workers are public employees. About one-fourth of state and local government employees are not covered by Social Security for various historical and other reasons. The 1935 Social Security Act did not extend coverage to state and local government workers. Since the 1950s, Congress has passed laws to allow state and local government employees who have public pensions to elect Social Security coverage through employee referendums. In 1990, Congress made Social Security coverage mandatory, starting in July 1991, for most state and local government employees who are not covered by an alternative public pension plan. Some have proposed extending mandatory Social Security coverage to all newly hired public employees. Recently, this proposal was included in the recommendations of the Bipartisan Policy Center's Debt Reduction Task Force and the National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform. According to the Social Security Administration (SSA), mandatory Social Security coverage of newly hired state and local government workers would close an estimated 8% to 9% of Social Security's projected average 75-year funding shortfall (the greatest positive financial effect would occur during the initial period following implementation) and extend Social Security trust fund solvency by 2 to 3 years. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that the proposal would increase net federal revenues by $24 billion over 5 years and $96 billion over 10 years. Supporters of mandatory Social Security coverage maintain that it would result in better benefit protections for workers and their families through the provision of dependents' and survivors' benefits and full cost-of-living adjustments under Social Security. Opponents argue that mandatory coverage would not necessarily provide better benefit protections compared with existing non-covered pension plans; the net effect on a worker's total benefits would depend in part on how state and local governments modify their existing pension plans in response to mandatory coverage. Moreover, Congress could enact changes to the Social Security contribution and benefit structure that result in higher payroll taxes and lower benefits for current workers in response to Social Security's projected long-range funding shortfall. Supporters point out that, unlike state and local pension plan coverage, Social Security coverage is portable (i.e., coverage is transferrable as a worker moves from job to job). Mandatory Social Security coverage would prevent gaps in coverage that can adversely affect workers, especially those who become disabled. Some supporters of mandatory coverage argue that Social Security reduces poverty among retired and disabled workers, spouses, dependent children, and the survivors of deceased workers. They argue that all workers should share in providing this poverty reduction, which has national benefits. Many state and local government employers and employees oppose mandatory Social Security coverage, even if it were extended only to newly hired employees. State and local governments are concerned that mandatory coverage could increase pension system costs significantly at a time when many state and local pension systems are struggling financially. The extent of cost increases would depend on how states and localities adjust their existing pension plans in response to mandatory Social Security coverage. Some state and local government employees and advocacy groups express concern that existing non-covered pension plans, including those designed for specific categories of workers such as fire fighters and police officers, could be ""undermined"" if Social Security coverage were mandated.",govreport
"T rade Adjustment Assistance for Workers (TAA) provides federal assistance to workers who involuntarily lose their jobs due to foreign competition. The primary benefits for TAA-eligible workers are funding for training and reemployment services as well as income support while a worker is enrolled in training. Workers may also be eligible for other benefits, including a tax credit equal to a portion of qualified health insurance premiums. Workers age 50 and over may be eligible for Reemployment Trade Adjustment Assistance, a wage supplement program. After a brief discussion of the program's purpose and most recent reauthorization, this report describes TAA as reauthorized by the Trade Adjustment Assistance Reauthorization Act of 2015 (TAARA, Title IV of P.L. 114-27 ). Reduced barriers to international trade are widely acknowledged to offer benefits to consumers in the form of increased choices and lower prices. Expanded trade may also offer expansionary opportunities to firms that produce goods or services that see increased exports. Reduced barriers to trade may, however, have concentrated negative effects on domestic industries and workers that face increased competition. TAA is designed to provide readjustment assistance to workers who suffer dislocation (job loss) due to foreign competition or offshoring. Generally, TAA provides a more robust set of benefits and services than would be available to a worker who lost his or her job for reasons other than foreign competition. TAA is designed to assist workers who have been adversely affected by reduced trade barriers and increased trade. Its availability to workers who are adversely affected by declines in international trade may be limited. TAA was created in 1962 and, historically, has been reauthorized alongside expansionary trade policies. A detailed legislative history of the program is in the Appendix . In June 2015, TAA was reauthorized by TAARA. The eligibility and benefit provisions of TAARA are authorized to continue through June 30, 2021. TAARA was part of a bill that extended other trade-related policies. TAARA was also passed in conjunction with a separate bill that reauthorized the Trade Promotion Authority (TPA, Title I of P.L. 114-26 ). TPA (also known as ""fast track"") grants the President authority to negotiate trade agreements, which are then subject to an ""up or down"" vote in Congress. Since the reauthorization of TPA in 2015, Congress has not voted on any presidentially negotiated trade agreements. This report focuses on the eligibility and benefit provisions of TAA as enacted by TAARA. These provisions apply to all workers certified for TAA after the law's enactment. The law also had retroactivity provisions and, in some cases, workers who were parts of groups certified prior to the 2015 reauthorization may be covered under the TAARA provisions. In other cases, however, a worker who was certified under pre-2015 provisions may continue to receive benefits under the prior provisions. As such, while the version of the program described in this report will apply to all new program participants certified through June 30, 2021, it may not apply to some participants who are covered by a TAA petition that was certified prior to the enactment of TAARA. In these cases, states may operate multiple TAA programs to concurrently serve workers certified under the TAARA provisions and workers certified under other provisions. TAA is jointly administered by the federal government and the states. It is funded by the federal government. The respective roles of federal and state governments in administering and financing the TAA program were in place prior to TAARA and were not substantively changed by the reauthorization law. TAA is jointly administered by the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) and cooperating state agencies. DOL makes group eligibility determinations, allots appropriated funds to cooperating state agencies, and oversees grantees. Individual benefits are provided through state workforce systems and state unemployment insurance systems. Workers may physically receive benefits and services through local American Job Centers (also known as One-Stop Career Centers). States are responsible for collecting participation and outcome data and reporting these data to DOL. The Health Coverage Tax Credit, which is available to qualified TAA-certified workers who purchase qualified health insurance, is administered by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). It is administered separately from the TAA program's other benefits and services. TAA is funded by mandatory appropriations. Typically, Congress appropriates a single sum that supports all TAA activities. DOL then allocates these funds to various program activities. Under TAARA, funding for training and reemployment services is capped at $450 million per year. These funds are allotted to the states via a grant allocation formula that considers past and anticipated program usage. States may expend training and reemployment service funds in the year of allotment or in either of the next two fiscal years. Training subsidies are states' primary expenditures out of their reemployment services funding. TAARA specifies that states must allocate at least 5% of their reemployment services funding to case management and no more than 10% to administrative costs. Funds for the Trade Readjustment Allowance income support and Reemployment Trade Adjustment Assistance wage insurance program are not capped. Appropriations for these benefits are based on congressional estimates. Funding for these benefits that is not spent in the year of allotment is returned to the Treasury. TAA is a direct spending (also referred to as ""mandatory"") program and subject to sequestration under the Budget Control Act of 2011, as amended. For FY2018, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) determined that the reduction for nonexempt, nondefense spending would be 6.6%. Sequester levels in subsequent years will be determined by OMB. In FY2018, Congress appropriated $790 million for the TAA for Workers programs. Of this amount, $450 million was for training and reemployment services and the remaining $340 million was for income support and wage insurance. The entire $790 million appropriation was subject to 6.6% sequestration ($52.14 million). DOL opted to apply the entirety of the sequestration to the training and reemployment services funding, reducing the funding for training and reemployment services from $450 million to $397.86 million and leaving the $340 million for income support and wage insurance unchanged. Obtaining TAA benefits is a two-stage process. First, a group of workers or their representative (e.g., firm, union, or state) must petition DOL to establish that their job loss was attributable to foreign trade and met statutory criteria. Once a group has been certified by DOL, individual workers covered by the group's petition apply for state-administered benefits at local American Job Centers (AJCs; also known as One-Stop Career Centers). TAA is available to workers in the 50 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico. To be eligible for TAA group certification, a group of workers from a firm (or a subdivision of a firm) must have become totally or partially separated from their employment or have been threatened with becoming totally or partially separated. Private sector workers who produce goods (""articles"" in the law) or services are eligible for TAA. The petitioning workers must establish that foreign trade contributed importantly to their separation. The role of foreign trade can be established in one of several ways: An increase in competitive imports . The sales or production of the petitioning firm have decreased absolutely and imports of articles or services like or directly competitive with those produced by the petitioning firm have increased. A shift in production to a foreign country . The workers' firm has moved production of the articles or services that the petitioning workers produced to a foreign country or the firm has acquired, from a foreign provider, articles or services that are directly competitive with those produced by the workers. Adversely affected secondary workers . The petitioning firm is a supplier or a downstream producer to a TAA-certified firm and either (1) the sales or production for the TAA-certified firm accounted for at least 20% of the sales or production of the petitioning firm or (2) a loss of business with a TAA-certified firm contributed importantly to the workers' job losses. USITC workers . Workers separated from firms that have been publicly identified by the United States International Trade Commission (USITC) as injured by a market disruption or other qualified action. The TAA eligibility criteria are designed to target workers who lose their jobs due to increased international trade and increased imports. The structure of the eligibility criteria mean that the program may not be available to workers who are adversely affected by reductions in international trade or declines in exports. To establish TAA eligibility, a group of workers (or their representative, such as a union, firm, or state) must complete a two-page petition and submit it, along with any supporting documentation, to DOL. An additional copy of the TAA petition must also be filed with the governor of the state in which the affected firm is located. After receiving the petition, DOL investigates to determine if the petition meets any of the criteria outlined in the previous subsection of this report. Determinations of TAA petitions are published in the Federal Register and on the DOL website. If a petition is certified, DOL will also determine an impact date on which trade-related layoffs began or threatened to begin. This date can be as early as one year prior to the petition. A certified petition will cover all workers laid off by the firm (or applicable subdivision of the firm) between the impact date and two years after the certification of the petition. For example, if a petition is certified on November 1, 2015, and the impact date is found to be March 1, 2015, all members of the certified group laid off between March 1, 2015, and November 1, 2017, would be eligible for TAA benefits. If a petition is denied, the group may request administrative reconsideration by DOL. Reconsideration requests must be mailed within 30 days of the publication of the initial denial in the Federal Register . Workers who are denied certification may seek judicial review of DOL's initial petition denial or denial following administrative reconsideration. Appeals for judicial review must be filed with the U.S. Court of International Trade within 60 days of Federal Register publication of the initial denial or the administrative reconsideration denial. After DOL certifies a group of workers as eligible, the individual workers covered by the certification then apply to their local AJCs for individual benefits. To be eligible for Trade Readjustment Allowance payments, a worker must meet all of the following conditions: (1) separation from the firm on or after the impact date specified in the certification but within two years of DOL certification, (2) employment with the affected firm in at least 26 of the 52 weeks preceding layoff, (3) entitlement to state unemployment compensation (UC) benefits, and (4) no disqualification for extended unemployment benefits. Additionally, workers must be enrolled in an approved training program or have received a waiver from training. Group-certified workers who are denied individual benefits can appeal the decision. The determination notice that individual workers receive after filing their applications for each benefit explains their appeal rights and time limits for filing appeals. TAA benefits for individual workers include training and reemployment services and income support for workers who have exhausted their UC benefits and are enrolled in training. Workers age 50 and over may participate in the Reemployment Trade Adjustment Assistance (RTAA) wage insurance program. Certified workers may also be eligible for a tax credit for a portion of the premium costs for qualified health insurance. TAA-certified workers may receive several types of benefits and services to aid them in preparing for and obtaining new employment. The largest reemployment benefit from a budgetary standpoint is training assistance. Workers may also receive case management services and reimbursements for qualified job search and relocation expenses. TAARA caps annual funding for training and reemployment services at $450 million per year. Training and reemployment services funds are granted to state workforce agencies via formula. Eligible workers request training assistance through their local AJCs. Statute specifies that training for a worker shall be approved if all of the following conditions are met: there is no suitable employment available for an adversely affected worker, the worker would benefit from appropriate training, there is a reasonable expectation of employment following completion of such training, training approved by the Secretary is reasonably available to the worker from either governmental agencies or private sources, the worker is qualified to undertake and complete such training, and such training is suitable for the worker and available at a reasonable cost. Once approved, training can be paid on the worker's behalf directly to the service provider or through a voucher system. The range of approved training includes a variety of governmental and private programs. There is no federal limit on the amount of training funding an individual can receive, though some states have a cap. A concise summation of TAA training programs is difficult due to the range of acceptable activities and the decentralized nature of approval and training. Data from DOL, however, offer some insight into the nature and duration of TAA-sponsored training programs. In FY2015, approximately 88% of TAA training participants received what DOL describes as occupational skills training: training in a specific occupation, typically provided in a classroom setting. The remainder of training was classified as remedial, prerequisite, on-the-job, or other customized training. Among program participants who exited the TAA program in FY2015 and participated in training, 70% completed their program of training. Among the training participants who completed their training programs in FY2015, the average duration of enrollment in the program was 512 days and the average training cost was $13,062. TAA does not require training programs to lead to a degree or other credential. In its FY2015 annual report, DOL reported that 89% of workers who completed training earned an industry-recognized credential, or a secondary school diploma or equivalent. TAA funding may be the only source of funding for a worker's training costs. Statute addresses scenarios in which other resources are used in the pursuit of TAA-funded training. In determining if the cost of a training program is reasonable, an administering state agency may consider public and private non-TAA funding available to the worker. For example, a worker may voluntarily offer to pay for a portion of a program with personal funds so that an agency may approve a program for which the costs would not otherwise be reasonable. An administering state agency may not require a TAA-certified worker to contribute personal funds or apply for other assistance as a condition of approving a TAA training program. A key exception of the policy of administering state agencies considering non-TAA aid is that the Higher Education Act specifies that certain types of federal student aid (including Pell Grants) ""shall not be taken into account in determining the need or eligibility of any person for benefits or assistance, or the amount of such benefits or assistance, under any Federal, State, or local program financed in whole or in part with Federal funds."" As such, a TAA-certified worker's training benefit could not be reduced on the basis of that worker's access to a Pell Grant. Guidance from DOL notes that this policy ""allows a worker to use student financial assistance for living expenses instead of tuition and thus provides the worker income support during long-term training."" TAARA specifies that, through the administering state agencies and AJC system, DOL shall provide a series of case management and employment services to all TAA-certified workers. These services include a comprehensive assessment of a worker's skills and needs, assistance in developing an individual employment objective and identifying the training and services necessary to achieve that goal, and guidance on training and other services for which a worker may be eligible. Under TAARA, states are required to use at least 5% of their reemployment services allotments for case management and employment services. States may use their reemployment services funding to provide job search and relocation allowances. These allowances target workers who are unable to obtain suitable employment within their commuting areas. Certified workers can receive an allowance equal to 90% of each of their job search and relocation expenses, up to a maximum of $1,250 for each benefit. A Job Search Allowance may be available to subsidize transportation and subsistence costs related to job search activities outside an eligible worker's local commuting area. Subsistence payments may not exceed 50% of the federal per diem rate and travel payments may not exceed the prevailing mileage rate authorized under federal travel regulations. A Relocation Allowance may be available to workers who have secured permanent employment outside their local commuting area. The benefit covers 90% of the reasonable and necessary expenses of moving the workers, their families, and their household items. Relocating workers may also be eligible for a lump sum payment of up to three times their weekly wage, though the total relocation benefit may not exceed $1,250. Trade Readjustment Allowance (TRA) is a weekly income support payment to certified workers who have exhausted their UC benefits and who are enrolled in training. To be eligible for TRA, a worker must be enrolled in training within 26 weeks of separation from the worker's job or within 26 weeks of TAA certification, whichever is later. In limited circumstances, a worker may obtain a training waiver. TRA is funded by the federal government and administered by the states through their unemployment insurance systems. TRA is an individual entitlement and not subject to an annual funding cap. Appropriation levels are based on estimated usage and unused funds are returned to the Treasury at the end of the fiscal year. Individual TRA benefit levels are equal to a worker's final UC benefit. UC benefit levels are based on earnings during a base period of employment (typically, the first four of the last five completed calendar quarters). UC benefits typically replace a portion of a worker's wages up to a statewide maximum. Since states each administer their own UC programs, there is some variation in benefit levels. In July 2015, the highest maximum weekly UC benefit for a worker with no dependents was $698 in Massachusetts and the lowest maximum weekly benefit was $240 in Arizona. There are three stages of TRA Basic TRA. The weekly basic TRA payment begins the week after a worker's UC eligibility expires. To receive the basic TRA benefit, workers must be enrolled or participating in TAA-approved training, have completed such training, or have obtained a waiver from the training requirement. The total amount of basic TRA benefits available to a worker is equal to 52 times the weekly TRA benefit minus the total amount of UC benefits. For example, assuming a constant benefit level, a worker who received 20 weeks of UC benefits would be eligible for 32 weeks of basic TRA. Additional TRA. After basic TRA has been exhausted, workers who are enrolled in a TAA-approved training program are eligible for an additional 65 weeks of income support, for a total of 117 weeks of benefits. Additional TRA is limited to workers who are enrolled in a training program; workers who have received a training waiver are not eligible for additional TRA. TAA participants may only collect additional TRA as long as they remain enrolled in a qualified training program. In cases where a worker's training program is shorter than the maximum TRA duration, the worker is not entitled to the maximum number of TRA weeks. Completion TRA. In cases where a worker has collected 117 weeks of combined TRA and UC and is still enrolled in a training program that leads to a degree or industry-recognized credential, the worker may collect TRA for up to 13 additional weeks (130 weeks total) if the worker will complete the training program during that time. RTAA is an entitlement that provides a wage supplement for workers age 50 and over who are certified for TAA benefits and obtain reemployment at a lower wage. The program provides a cash payment to an eligible worker equal to 50% of the difference between the worker's wage at the trade-affected job and the worker's wage at his or her new job. The maximum benefit is $10,000 over a two-year period. Workers may not receive TRA and RTAA benefits simultaneously. To be eligible for RTAA, a worker must either (1) be reemployed on a full-time basis, as defined by the law of the state in which the worker is employed or (2) be reemployed at least 20 hours a week and be enrolled in a TAA-sponsored training program. Workers who receive RTAA payments while enrolled in training and working less than full time may be subject to a reduced benefit. Workers who are receiving TRA, UC in lieu of TRA, or RTAA benefits may also be eligible for a tax credit that covers a portion of eligible health insurance premiums. The Health Coverage Tax Credit (HCTC) is equal to 72.5% of qualified health insurance premiums. TAARA includes provisions specifying that a worker must elect between the HCTC and premium credits under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act ( P.L. 111-148 , amended). Unlike other provisions of TAARA, which are in effect through June 30, 2021, the HCTC is authorized through December 31, 2019. The Trade Act requires DOL to collect and publish specified data on TAA participation, benefits, outcomes, and spending. Data to be collected and reported include (but are not limited to) the following: Data on petitions filed, certified, and denied . These data include the number of petitions filed, certified, and denied, as well as the average processing time for such petitions. Certified petitions must be disaggregated on the basis of eligibility. Data on benefits received . These data include the number of workers receiving TRA and other benefits as well as the average duration for which workers received benefits. Data on training . These data include the number of workers who participated in training, the average duration of such training, and the average per-worker cost of training. Data on outcomes . These data include the percentage of workers who are in unsubsidized employment during the second calendar quarter after exit, the earnings of such workers, the percentage of workers who are in unsubsidized employment in the fourth quarter after exit, and the percentage of workers who received a recognized postsecondary credential. Data on rapid response activities . These data include whether or not a state provided rapid response services to each firm that petitioned for benefits. Data on spending . These data include state and national payments for TRA benefits, training, administration, and job search and relocation allowances. The data required by the Trade Act are collected by the state agencies that administer the TAA program. These data are submitted to DOL, which publishes the data and other relevant information in annual reports. Since 2014, DOL has also published quarterly data and analysis on its website. In addition to participation data, DOL maintains a database of individual firms' TAA petitions. Users can access firm-level information, including the firm's full petition and DOL's assessment and determination of the petition. Early History The first TAA programs were enacted in 1962 but little used until the Trade Act of 1974 eased eligibility requirements. Program use expanded through the 1970s and the number of certified workers increased from about 59,000 in FY1975 to nearly 600,000 in FY1980. In light of rapidly increasing program costs, the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1981 ( P.L. 97-35 ) cut spending by reducing benefits and emphasizing training and other reemployment services. TAA participation levels fluctuated throughout the 1980s, but were mostly well below the levels of the 1970s. In 1988, the program was reauthorized through FY1993 by the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988 ( P.L. 100-418 ). Among other changes, the 1988 reauthorization expanded eligibility for TRA but also placed a new emphasis on training by making it a program requirement. 1990s and NAFTA The Omnibus Reconciliation Act of 1993 ( P.L. 103-66 ) reauthorized TAA through 1998 with reductions in training funding. The North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) Implementation Act of 1993 ( P.L. 103-182 ) established a new component of TAA that offered dedicated benefits to workers whose job loss was attributable to trade with Mexico and Canada. Trade Act of 2002 The next major reauthorization of TAA was part of the Trade Act of 2002 ( P.L. 107-210 ). This law combined TAA, TPA, and other trade-related issues into a single piece of legislation. Among other changes, the 2002 TAA reauthorization merged the NAFTA-TAA program into the general TAA program and created the Health Coverage Tax Credit for TAA workers. The Trade Act of 2002 reauthorized TAA through FY2007. Several short-term extensions continued the program until it was reauthorized in February 2009. American Recovery and Reinvestment Act In February 2009, TAA was reauthorized and expanded by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA; P.L. 111-5 ). Unlike other reauthorizations, which tended to be aligned with expansionary trade policy or budget reconciliations, this reauthorization was aligned with other domestic initiatives to spur economic activity during a time of above-average unemployment. The ARRA reauthorization of TAA expanded the program in several ways. Among other provisions, it increased funding for training, increased the maximum number of weeks that a worker could receive TRA, and extended eligibility to service sector and public sector workers who had been displaced by trade. The ARRA provisions of TAA were scheduled to expire after December 31, 2010. A short-term extension continued the program through February 12, 2011. After that date, TAA reverted to the more limited eligibility and benefit provisions that were in place prior to ARRA. 2011 Reauthorization: Trade Adjustment Assistance Extension Act In October 2011, the Trade Adjustment Assistance Extension Act (TAAEA; Title II of P.L. 112-40 ) was enacted. This reauthorization was aligned with the separate passage of three implementing bills of free trade agreements with Colombia, Panama, and South Korea. TAAEA reinstated some, but not all, of the expansions that had been enacted under ARRA. Most notably, it re-expanded eligibility to service sector (but not public sector) workers and increased training funding to near-ARRA levels. TAAEA also curtailed benefits by reducing the eligible reasons for training waivers from six to three. Sunset and Termination Provisions of 2011 Reauthorization The eligibility and benefit provisions initially enacted by TAAEA were scheduled to remain in place until December 31, 2013. Beginning January 1, 2014, the TAA program reverted to a more limited set of eligibility and benefit provisions (""Reversion 2014 provisions""). Among other changes, the Reversion 2014 provisions ended eligibility for service workers and reduced the cap on training funding to the 2002 levels. The Reversion 2014 provisions were scheduled to remain in place for one year before authorization expired after December 31, 2014, and the program was scheduled to begin to be phased out. The program did not, however, expire as scheduled at the end of 2014. Instead, the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2015 ( P.L. 113-235 ) provided funding for full operation of the program under the Reversion 2014 provisions through FY2015. 2015 Reauthorization: Trade Adjustment Assistance Reauthorization Act TAA continued to operate under the Reversion 2014 provisions until the enactment of the Trade Adjustment Assistance Reauthorization Act of 2015 (TAARA; Title IV of P.L. 114-27 ). This reauthorization was aligned with the separate extension of the Trade Promotion Authority (TPA, also known as ""fast track""). Any agreements negotiated under TPA are subject to an ""up or down"" vote in Congress. TAARA reinstated many of the eligibility and benefit provisions that were enacted by TAAEA in 2011. TAARA reinstated eligibility for service workers and increased training funding to a level between those of TAAEA and the Reversion 2014 provisions. Sunset and Termination Provisions of 2015 Reauthorization TAARA contains sunset provisions similar to those in TAAEA that took effect in 2014. Beginning July 1, 2021, the TAA program is scheduled to revert to a more limited set of eligibility and benefit provisions that are similar to the Reversion 2014 provisions. These provisions are scheduled to remain in place for one year until authorization is set to expire after June 30, 2022, and then the program is scheduled to begin to be phased out.","Trade Adjustment Assistance for Workers (TAA) provides federal assistance to workers who have involuntarily lost their jobs due to foreign competition. It was last reauthorized by the Trade Adjustment Assistance Reauthorization Act of 2015 (TAARA; Title IV of P.L. 114-27). This report discusses the TAA program as enacted by TAARA. To be eligible for TAA, a group of workers must establish that they were separated from their employment either because their jobs moved outside the United States or because of an increase in directly competitive imports. Workers at firms that are suppliers to or downstream producers of TAA-certified firms may also be eligible for TAA benefits. Private sector workers who produce goods or services are eligible for TAA benefits. To establish eligibility for TAA benefits, a group of trade-affected workers (or their representative) must petition the Department of Labor (DOL) and a DOL investigation must verify the role of increased foreign trade in the workers' job losses. Once a petition is certified by DOL, covered workers may apply for individual benefits. Individual benefits are funded by the federal government and administered by state agencies through their workforce systems and unemployment insurance systems. Benefits available to individual workers include the following: Training and reemployment services are designed to assist workers in preparing for and obtaining new employment. Training subsidies are the largest reemployment services expenditure and support workers in developing skills for a new occupation. Workers may also receive case management services and job search assistance. In some cases, workers who pursue employment outside their local commuting area may be eligible for job search or relocation allowances. Trade Readjustment Allowance (TRA) is a weekly income support payment for TAA-certified workers who have exhausted their unemployment compensation (UC) and who are enrolled in an eligible training program. Weekly TRA payments are equal to the worker's final weekly UC benefit. Workers may collect UC and TRA for a combined maximum of 130 weeks, the final 13 of which are only available if necessary for the worker to complete a qualified training program. Reemployment Trade Adjustment Assistance (RTAA) is a wage insurance program available to certified workers age 50 and over who obtain reemployment at a lower wage. The wage insurance program provides a cash payment equal to 50% of the difference between the worker's new wage and previous wage, up to a two-year maximum of $10,000. The Health Coverage Tax Credit is a credit equal to 72.5% of qualified health insurance premiums. Eligibility is aligned with TRA. Unlike other TAA benefits, it is administered through the tax code. TAA is a mandatory program that is supported through annual appropriations. Appropriations for the program in FY2018 were $790 million.",govreport
"Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code is used by financially troubled business debtors that want to reorganize their financial affairs so that they may remain in business rather than liquidate. Although a trustee is appointed in chapter 7 liquidations, in a business reorganization under chapter 11, the debtor generally remains in possession and no trustee is appointed, thus allowing those most familiar with the business to continue managing it. The Bankruptcy Code generally provides debtors the opportunity to either assume or reject executory contracts in existence at the time the bankruptcy petition is filed. One sort of executory contract, collective bargaining agreements (CBAs), is treated somewhat differently. Although rejection of any executory contract is subject to the approval of the court, for most contracts, the business judgment rule applies and courts generally approve rejections that the debtor deems to be in its business interest. Rejection of CBAs must meet a higher standard. Section 1113 of the Bankruptcy Code provides the procedures that must be followed to reject a CBA. Recently introduced legislation would modify several sections of the Bankruptcy Code, including Â§ 1113. H.R. 3652 and its companion bill, S. 2092 , were introduced by Representative Conyers and Senator Kennedy and are entitled the ""Protecting Employees and Retirees in Business Bankruptcies Act of 2007."" In this report, the two bills will be referred to as either H.R. 3652 or ""the bill."" This report's analysis of the bill will be limited to the modifications it proposes for Â§ 1113 of the Bankruptcy Code. These modifications are found in Â§ 8 of the bill. In its findings section, the bill asserts that despite recently enacted provisions to limit executive compensation, executive pay enhancements flourish in business bankruptcies at the expense of workers and retirees. According to the bill, workers and retirees are being disproportionately burdened in business bankruptcies. These workers and retirees have no way to diversify the risk of an employer's bankruptcy and are least able to absorb the losses imposed. H.R. 3652 urges ""[c]omprehensive reform ... to remedy these fundamental inequities in the bankruptcy process and to recognize the unique firm-specific investment by employees and retirees in their employers' business through their labor."" In 1984, the Bankruptcy Code was amended to add 11 U.S.C. Â§ 1113, which outlines the requirements that must be met before a court can approve rejection of a collective bargaining agreement (CBA) by a debtor company using chapter 11 to reorganize. The section applies only to chapter 11 bankruptcies. Although there are no committee reports to explain the reason for adding 11 U.S.C. Â§ 1113, its addition followed the U.S. Supreme Court's holding in National Labor Relations Board v. Bildisco and Bildisco . It is generally believed that Congress added the section in response to Bildisco . Bildisco was decided in February 1984, resolving a split between the circuits regarding the standard for rejection of a CBA. The Court held that rejection required that the agreement be burdensome to the debtor company and that rejection was favored after balancing the equities of the specific case. The Court also held that the debtor in possession did not automatically assume the CBA post-petition and would not violate Â§ 8(a)(5) of the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) if it unilaterally changed the terms of a CBA prior to the bankruptcy court's approval of rejection of that agreement. By adding Â§ 1113, Congress provided both a procedure and a standard for rejection of CBAs and clarified that they could not be rejected under 11 U.S.C. Â§ 365 as are other executory contracts. Furthermore, unilateral changes to the CBA were addressed and generally prohibited. H.R. 3652 proposes a number of changes to existing subsections of 11 U.S.C. Â§ 1113 as well as adding six new subsections. As written, the bill would entirely replace the text of the first three subsections; however, the actual change to the text of the first subsection is minimal. At first glance, the bill appears to make dramatic changes in the Bankruptcy Code, but in some cases, the bill's language may be clarifying the Code rather than substantively changing it. In other cases, the language in the bill may be intended to either legislate resolution of some point of law that has been disputed in the courts or legislatively overrule existing case law. However, since there are no committee reports as yet, CRS cannot discern with certainty the sponsors' intent in proposing the changes. The proposed changes will be discussed in order, subsection by subsection, with accompanying discussion about the current state of the law, including ambiguities in the current code, various courts' interpretations, and scholarly writings about 11 U.S.C. Â§ 1113. All headings referencing a subsection of 11 U.S.C. Â§ 1113 refer to the subsections as proposed by this bill. Although the language of H.R. 3652 indicates that subsection (a) is deleted entirely, there is only one difference between the current text and the proposed textâthat is the removal of the words ""assume or."" As currently written, 11 U.S.C. Â§ 1113(a) states that a debtor ""may assume or reject a collective bargaining agreement only in accordance with the provisions of this section."" However, that is the only time that assumption of CBAs is referred to in the entire section. Courts generally have found that 11 U.S.C. Â§ 365 governs the assumption of CBAs, but removing ""assume"" from the language of 11 U.S.C. Â§ 1113(a), would seem to make it clear from the statute that nothing in 11 U.S.C. Â§ 1113 applies to assumptions of CBAs. Note, however, although it would remove ""assume"" from this subsection, the bill would add a later subsection stating that assumptions of CBAs are in accordance with 11 U.S.C. Â§ 365, which addresses executory contracts generally. H.R. 3652 would limit the modifications to the existing CBA that can be proposed by the debtor. The current law provides general guidance about the type of proposal that should be made: a proposal should provide the modifications in benefits and protections that are necessary for reorganization and assure fair treatment to ""all creditors, the debtor, and all of the affected parties."" In contrast, the bill would limit proposals to those that would (1) limit the effect of the labor group's financial concessions to no more than two years after the effective date of the plan; (2) be the minimum savings the debtor needs to successfully reorganize; and (3) not put too great a burden on the labor group, either in amount or nature of the concession, in comparison to burdens placed on other groups, ""including management personnel."" Current law puts no time limit on the duration of the effects a debtor's proposed modifications to a CBA may have on the relevant affected labor group. Although an authorized representative always has the option of rejecting a debtor's proposal, a court will not necessarily find that the debtor's proposal was not fair and equitable to all affected parties even if its effects on the labor group are long-lasting. If the court finds the proposal fair and equitable, it may grant rejection of the CBA. H.R. 3652 would prohibit court approval of rejection unless the debtor's proposals for modification were in compliance with the proposed limitations. Therefore, limiting the debtor to proposals affecting the labor group for no more than two years would assure labor groups that they would not be confronted with situations in which a CBA's rejection was approved by the court after the labor group had rejected a debtor's proposal for lengthy concessions. If such lengthy concessions were proposed, the court would not be allowed to approve rejection because the debtor's proposal would not be in compliance with the requirements of (proposed) 11 U.S.C. Â§ 1113(b)(1)(A). However, limiting the duration of modifications to a CBA may limit the debtor's ability to successfully reorganize. Modifications that can, in just two years, provide sufficient economic relief for the company's survival may necessarily require economic concessions from employees that are too burdensome to be acceptable because the effect on paychecks is too great. Conversely, modifications that last no more than two years but also have a smaller effect on paychecks may not provide sufficient economic relief to allow the debtor company to survive, effectively forcing the company into liquidation. The bill's second requirement for debtors' proposals is that they must ""be no more than the minimal savings necessary to permit the debtor to exit bankruptcy such that confirmation of such plan is not likely to be followed by the liquidation of the debtor."" It is questionable whether this will do anything to clarify existing law, under which there have been conflicts over the meaning of ""necessary"" in the current requirement that the debtor make a proposal that ""provides for those necessary modifications in the employees benefits and protections that are necessary to permit . . . reorganization."" Some courts have held that necessary means the minimum needed to avoid immediate liquidation; other courts have found that ""necessary"" is a more lenient standard than ""essential,"" and have looked at whether the modifications will ensure the debtor's ability to survive reorganization. By including the phrase ""such that confirmation of the plan is not likely to be followed by the liquidation of the debtor,"" it seems that the bill is intended to use the more lenient standard. However, the use of ""no more than the minimal savings"" could cause a court to use a stricter standard. If the bill's language were strictly interpreted to mean that the debtor may propose no more than the absolute minimum savings, the debtor might be in a virtually untenable position. One court, in construing the current law's requirement that modifications be ""necessary"" to allow reorganization, noted that in the context of this statute ""necessary"" must be read as a term of lesser degree than ""essential."" To find otherwise, would be to render the subsequent requirement of good faith negotiation, which the statute requires must take place after the making of the original proposal and prior to the date of the hearing, meaningless, since the debtor would thereby be subject to a finding that any substantial lessening of the demands made in the original proposal proves that the original proposal's modifications were not ""necessary."" If the proposed requirement that proposed modifications would produce no more than the minimal savings required were taken literally, debtors would be similarly constrained. The third limitation on proposals looks only at the burdens that are placed on the groups with whom the debtor is expected to have continuing relationships, rather than looking at whether all are being treated ""fairly and equitably"" as required by current law. The proposed change would also specify management personnel as one of the groups to be considered in determining whether the labor group is being overly burdened. Throughout the history of 11 U.S.C. Â§ 1113, courts have considered management personnel when considering whether a debtor's proposal treated all parties fairly and equitably. However, they have looked at the whole picture rather than simply comparing burdens. For example, a proposal to reduce wages for union employees was considered fair and equitable even though some management employees received an increase in pay. The court's rationale was that it was fair to increase the pay of supervisors who had been earning less than those they were supervising. The language for proposed 11 U.S.C. Â§ 1113(b)(1)(C) could be construed to require those cuts in wages and benefits for employees must be matched by similar cuts for management employees. Whether that similarity would be construed to require dollar-for-dollar parity or percentage-based parity is unknown. Current law requires three conditions be met before a court can grant a motion to reject a CBA: (1) The debtor must meet the requirements of 11 U.S.C. Â§ 1113(b)(1) by (a) presenting a proposal that both treats all parties equitably and proposes changes necessary for reorganization, and (b) providing the representative with information needed to evaluate the proposal; (2) The representative must have refused to accept the debtor's proposal without good cause; and (3) ""[T]he balance of equities [must] clearly favor[] rejection."" H.R. 3652 's proposed subsection (c) would have three main prongs as does the current subsection, but most of its similarity ends there. Current law has three fairly simple subparagraphs, each of which involves some discretionary judgment regarding facts and circumstances. The subparagraphs in proposed subsection (c) are complex and one provides a presumption that would bar rejection of a CBA if not effectively rebutted. Current practices among companies in bankruptcy may have triggered a perceived need for this provision. It appears that other provisions of this subsection may be in part a response to recent court decisions, but may be responding to Bildisco as well. Impasse . One of the changes in the process required for a court to approve rejection of a CBA is a new requirement that the parties have reached an impasse. The Bildisco Court specifically stated that approving a debtor's request for rejection should not require the courts to determine that negotiations had reached an impasse. Although 11 U.S.C. Â§ 1113 was introduced in response to concern over the Bildisco decision, neither the word ""impasse"" nor the concept appears in the current section 1113. In proposed 11 U.S.C. Â§ 1113(c)(1) the word appears twice and it appears a third time as a concept. CRS is uncertain if including ""impasse"" in H.R. 3652 is an attempt to resolve a long-standing issue or a response to current court decisions involving the airline industry. As noted below, courts have recently enjoined strikes that were threatened in response to rejection of CBAs. The Railroad Labor Act (RLA), unlike the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA), requires parties to ""exert every reasonable effort to make ... [an] agreement."" According to recent court decisions, labor groups governed by the RLA continue to be bound by this obligation even after a court has approved rejection of a CBA under 11 U.S.C. Â§ 1113. These courts interpreted the RLA as requiring labor groups to continue collective bargaining until there is no possibility that the parties can agree. At that point, most would agree that the parties have reached an impasse. If the changes to Â§ 1113(c)(1) are adopted, courts may need to determine if impasse is reached at some earlier point. CRS is uncertain how courts would construe the requirement that the parties be at ""impasse."" Since the proposed bill includes the phrase ""further negotiations are not likely to produce a mutually satisfactory agreement,"" courts may use a ""more likely than not"" standard. If, however, the courts construed ""impasse"" as equivalent to the recent court interpretations of the RLA standard, requiring an impasse as a prerequisite to rejection could effectively eliminate most rejectionsâpossibly through attrition since bargaining may well continue for a considerable period of time before a court would consider the parties at an impasse. If the company were to delay filing for bankruptcy and try to negotiate modifications to the CBA, parties who had not been able to reach a mutually satisfactory agreement might be considered to be at impasse when the bankruptcy case commences. However, whether the bargaining takes place before or after the bankruptcy filing, if it takes place over an extended period of time, a company might be forced to liquidate rather than reorganize. Those opposing this provision are likely to argue this would defeat the purpose of chapter 11 and, by not preserving jobs, would not protect workers. Those in favor of this provision are likely to argue that it encourages the parties to negotiate modifications each can accept, allowing the company to then continue with its workforce in place under a revised CBA. 11 U.S.C. Â§ 1113(c)(1)(A) . In addition to finding that the parties are at an impasse, this subparagraph requires that, before approving a request for rejection, the court find that the debtor has fulfilled the requirements regarding proposing modifications. This is similar to current law, which also requires the debtor to have fulfilled the requirements of current subsection (b)(1), except that the requirements that must be met are different. The proposed change mirrors current law in requiring that the debtor provide appropriate information to the representative and bargain in good faith. 11 U.S.C. Â§ 1113(c)(1)(B) . Under the bill, before approving rejection, the court must also ""consider[] alternative proposals by the authorized representative and determine[] that such proposals do not meet the requirements of subparagraphs (A) and (B) of subsection (b)(1)."" There is some ambiguity in this wording. Is the court to evaluate the representative's proposals as possible alternatives to the current CBA that the court might be able to impose on both the debtor and the labor group in lieu of outright rejection? On the other hand, could it mean that the court is simply to look at the representatives' proposals to determine whether they all meet the requirements of the subparagraphs? If they do, is the court then powerless to change the status quo of the CBA? There is nothing in the bill that explicitly gives the court the discretion to evaluate the representative's counterproposals and substitute one for the existing CBA. However, nothing in the current 11 U.S.C. Â§ 1113(c) gives courts the power to impose the debtor's last proposal on both the debtor and the labor group after the court has approved rejection, yet courts have exercised that power. Inconsistencies between courts in applying the current law appear to be part of the impetus behind H.R. 3652 . Allowing the courts more discretion might increase those inconsistencies and lead to more ""forum shopping"" in bankruptcy filings. Courts might construe proposed subsection (c)(1) as simply providing prerequisites that must be met before a CBA can be rejected. In this case, proposed subparagraphs (A) and (B) might act as a constraint on negotiations by the representative. Since liquidation of the company normally would involve loss of jobs, it may be in the labor group's interest to make concessions if the debtor cannot reorganize without those concessions. However, as noted earlier, at times the burden on employees would be too great if the required economic relief provided to the employer were concentrated in a period of two years. To lessen the immediate impact on employees' paychecks, a representative might want to spread the effect of the financial concessions over three years rather than two. However, a representative might be reluctant to offer such a proposal if making it would open the door for court-approval of rejection. This might create a built-in conflict between the labor group's interest in avoiding rejection of the CBA and its interest in preserving jobs by making sufficient concessions to the debtor to assure successful reorganization. Current law does not require the court to look at the representative's counterproposals, but only at whether the representative had good cause for rejecting the debtor's proposals. Under current law, rejection has generally been the ""stick"" that was applied when representatives could not come to an agreement with debtors and did not have good cause for refusing to agree. The effect was to encourage negotiations, which is what section 1113 was intended to do. It is unclear whether the proposed provisions would encourage both parties to negotiate. It is possible that the provisions could create an imbalance in the two parties' motivation to negotiate, but at this point, we do not know which party might be more motivated by the proposed provisions. 11 U.S.C. Â§ 1113(c)(1)(C) . This simply reiterates the impasse requirement by specifying that the court may only approve rejection if it finds that ""further negotiations are not likely to produce a mutually satisfactory agreement."" As noted earlier, courts may construe this as requiring less certainty as to the futility of further negotiations than exists under the RLA's requirement for continued bargaining. Under current law, the bankruptcy courts do not evaluate the prospects for an eventual agreement between the parties. 11 U.S.C. Â§ 1113(c)(1)(D) . This provision requires the court to consider how the labor group would be affected by the debtor's proposal, but it seems to presume that the labor group will strike if the CBA is rejected. It requires the court to consider the effect of such a strike, including the debtor company's ability to ""retain an experienced and qualified workforce."" Reorganization in bankruptcy is based on the concept that it is better for all concerned if a company can continue in business rather than liquidate. If the result of rejection of a CBA is a strike that would effectively put the company out of business, the court may decide not to allow a rejection. If, however, the debtor company is not in a position to remain in business under the terms of the existing CBA, the company may be forced to liquidate rather than reorganize. This alternative might leave all creditors, including the labor group, in worse shape than they would have been had the company reorganized. This subsection provides parameters for the court's consideration of whether the debtor's proposed modifications meet the requirements of subsection (b). The court must consider the impact on all subsidiaries and affiliates of the debtor company, including foreign subsidiaries and affiliates, but what this means in practice is unclear. The court is also required to examine the history of financial concessions made by the labor group. If any have been made within twenty-four months prior to the filing of the bankruptcy petition, the court's evaluation of the debtor's proposed modifications must aggregate the effect of the earlier concession with the effect of the currently proposed modifications. This aggregation is unlikely to affect whether the proposed modifications meet the requirements of proposed 11 U.S.C. 1113(b)(1)(A)-(B), but is likely to affect evaluation of the burden imposed on the labor group as compared to other groups. Under current law, in considering whether to approve rejection, the court has discretion in concluding that the required conditions have been met. While H.R. 3652 does not remove all of the court's discretion, in one area the bill appears to significantly restrict the court's discretion. H.R. 3652 would establish a presumption that the debtor has overly burdened the labor group in comparison to the burdens on other groups, including management, if it ""has implemented a program of incentive pay, bonuses, or other financial returns for insiders or senior management personnel during the bankruptcy, or . . . within 180 days"" before the case began. Unless that presumption can be effectively rebutted, the debtor will have failed to meet the requirements for rejection. The Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 (BAPCPA) restricted ""key employee retention plans"" (KERPS), which provided retention bonuses and severance pay to management employees who were retained to manage the business through its reorganization. Since BAPCPA became effective, there has been a move toward paying managers incentive payments, which were not restricted. Though some of these incentive pay schemes have been rejected by the courts as actually being retention bonuses that did not meet BAPCPA's requirements, others have been upheld as incentive bonuses and, therefore, not subject to the restrictions imposed by the post-BAPCPA Bankruptcy Code restrictions. In 2006, both the Senate and the House introduced bills that would have limited the use of incentive bonuses in the same way that BAPCPA had limited retention pay. Though the bills were not passed by the 109 th Congress, their provisions are included in H.R. 3652 . This bill would extend BAPCPA restrictions on retention pay to incentive and performance bonuses as well as ""bonus[es] of any kind, or other financial returns designed to replace or enhance incentive, stock, or other compensation in effect"" before the bankruptcy petition was filed. These restrictions are bolstered by the bill's proposed amendment to 11 U.S.C. Â§ 1113(c)(3). This proposed amendment could make it difficult for the court to approve rejection of a CBA if there were any sort of incentive pay, even if the court had approved the incentive pay after finding that it was necessary to retain a person whose services were essential for the business to continue, and met the other restrictions of 11 U.S.C. Â§ 503(c)(1). Arguably, this could put a court in the position of having little flexibility to make decisions that could result in the debtor company's successful reorganizationâif it allowed incentive pay to retain someone essential to the business, it could be unable to approve rejection of a CBA if the debtor could not rebut the presumption that the labor group was being burdened more than management. If it did not allow incentive payments, the company might lose an employee who was seen as necessary for survival. Either alternative might cause the debtor to liquidate rather than reorganize. However, it could also be argued that this provision would encourage debtors to carefully consider whether incentive pay was necessary and, if necessary, limit it so that an effective argument could be made that the incentive did not create a situation in which the labor group was disproportionately burdened by the modifications in a CBA. Under current law, the court is required to schedule a hearing within fourteen days after the debtor files an application for rejection. All interested parties currently have the right to attend the hearing and be heard and must receive notice at least ten days before the hearing. The court must rule on the application within thirty days unless otherwise agreed to by the debtor and representative. If the court does not rule within the required time, the debtor may unilaterally modify or terminate the CBA pending the court's ruling. H.R. 3652 would extend the period required for notice to at least twenty-one days. The bill deletes, rather than modifies, the provision for holding the hearing within fourteen days of the filing date. The deletion may have been unintentionalâthe intent may have been to set the same time frame for notice as for hearing. On the other hand, the deletion may have been intended to avoid requiring an early hearing on an application for rejection, permitting additional time for continuing negotiation between the debtor and the authorized representative. The bill would restrict the parties who could appear and be heard, limiting them to only the debtor and the authorized representative. This may have the effect of streamlining the hearing process by eliminating consideration of other parties' concerns. Under both current and proposed law, the creditors would have an opportunity to approve or reject the reorganization plan, which would incorporate the results of the rejection hearing. Under the bill's proposals, there would be no time frame within which the court would be required to rule and no provision allowing the debtor to unilaterally modify a CBA while a ruling was pending. This appears to encourage continuing negotiations between the debtor and the authorized representative without a statutory deadline. The bill proposes no changes to this sectionâwhile parties continue to negotiate changes to a CBA, courts would continue to be allowed to approve interim modifications to a CBA ""if essential to the continuation of the debtor's business, or in order to avoid irreparable damage to the estate."" However, the addition of subsection (g) as proposed in the bill, allowing labor groups to strike or engage in other methods of ""self-help"" in response to court-ordered modifications under this subsection, may tend to reduce either the extent to which courts are willing to approve interim modifications or the potential benefit to the debtor of an interim modification. If so, it could lead to liquidations rather than reorganizations when interim modifications are essential for the company to remain in business. H.R. 3652 would not change the current language, but would add a provision regarding allowed administrative claims. Under the bill's proposal, all payments required under 11 U.S.C. Â§ 1113 on or before the date of confirmation of the reorganization plan would be considered allowed administrative claims. That would mean that the plan would be required to provide for full payment of the claims. Currently there is no statute addressing whether court-approved rejection of a CBA gives rise to a claim for damages and courts have been divided on the subject. The bill would add a subsection that would define rejection of a CBA as a breach and would address the effect of rejection of a CBA, in terms of both money damages and ""self-help""âthe right of affected employees to strike. This is one of the subsections where the use of a particular word may have import that is not immediately obvious. In general, rejection of executory contracts has been treated as a breach. However, recently, in Northwest Airlines Corporation v. Association of Flight Attendants , rejection of a CBA was characterized not as a breach but as an abrogation. As the court viewed it, an abrogation has a different legal effect than does a breach. While a breach would have a remedy, an abrogation under 11 U.S.C. Â§ 1113 terminates the provisions of the CBA and allows substitution of court-approved provisions. It is possible that the word breach is used in this proposed subsection merely to identify the rationale for the prescribed remedy. On the other hand, it is possible that the word was used to legislate an effect of rejection that is different than that determined by the Northwest Airlines court. In evaluating which is more likely to be the case, one should consider that the court specifically contrasted the effect of rejection under 11 U.S.C. Â§ 365 with that under 11 U.S.C. Â§ 1113, stating, ""Contract rejection under Â§ 1113, unlike contract rejection under Â§ 365, permits more than non-performance."" According to the court, the purpose of 11 U.S.C. Â§ 1113 is ""to permit CBA rejection in favor of alternate terms without fear of liability after a final negotiation before, and authorization from, a bankruptcy court."" This seems to imply that the Northwest Airlines court's position is not only that rejection is an abrogation rather than a breach, but also that there are no damages to be recovered from rejection of a CBA under 11 U.S.C.Â§ 1113. Under the bill, court-approved rejection would be a breach of contract with the same effect as rejection of any other executory contract under 11 U.S.C. Â§ 365(g), but would exclude those damages from the limitations of 11 U.S.C. Â§ 502(b)(7). Under 11 U.S.C. Â§ 365(g), rejection of a contract is treated as a breach of contract immediately before the date the bankruptcy petition was filed. Section 502(b)(7) limits damages for termination of an employment contract to one year's compensation, without acceleration, plus any unpaid compensation. Although H.R. 3652 specifically excludes damages for rejected CBAs from the damage limitation of 11 U.S.C. Â§ 501(b)(7), the explicit exclusion may not be necessary since courts have held that the subsection does not apply to CBAs. Section 365(g) of the Bankruptcy Code sets the date of the breach as just before the filing of the petition, which would make such claims pre-petition claims. Pre-petition claims are generally unsecured, nonpriority claims. However, this bill proposes to define administrative expenses, which are priority claims, as including all payments required under 11 U.S.C. Â§ 1113 that must be paid on or before the date the reorganization plan is confirmed. Proposed subsection (g) does not actually mandate payment of the breach damages before the confirmation date, so it is unclear whether those damages are intended to be treated as an administrative expense and, therefore, a priority claim rather than as a pre-petition, nonpriority claim. If given the status of an administrative claim, it is difficult to foresee a situation in which a company could benefit from rejection of a CBA since it would appear likely that any financial gain garnered by rejecting the CBA would be lost through the breach damages for rejections. If those damages are treated as are other breach damages for rejection of executory contracts, they would be unsecured, nonpriority, pre-petition claims, and the reorganization plan could provide for partial rather than full payment of them, thereby allowing some economic benefit to the company in bankruptcy. Self-help by a labor group may consist of a strike or a threat of strike even though a strike could be an economic blow that a distressed company might arguably be unable to recover from. When a CBA is rejected in chapter 11 reorganization under the current provisions of 11 U.S.C. Â§ 1113(c), labor groups' right to strike seems to depend upon whether the group is covered by the RLA or the NLRA. Groups covered by the NLRA may strike even if the rejected CBA contained a ""no strike"" clause. Since the CBA no longer exists after rejection, the ""no strike"" clause has no continuing effect. Airline transportation workers, however, are covered by the RLA, which requires that the parties exert every reasonable effort to negotiate agreements even after a court-approved rejection. Therefore, several recent cases involving the airlines have resulted in injunctions prohibiting the unions from striking. Modifications to CBAs under current 11 U.S.C. Â§ 1113(d)(2) or (e) do not make the CBA ineffective in its entirety. Therefore, although a ""no strike"" clause would become ineffective after rejection of a CBA, it would remain in effect under current law when there are interim modifications to a CBA. H.R. 3652 would change the law so that all labor groups, even those controlled by the RLA would have the right to strike when a CBA was rejected. The right to strike would also exist if interim modifications were approved by a courtâapparently without reference to whether the CBA included a ""no strike"" clause. Since a strike might be a fatal economic blow to a distressed company and since interim modifications are approved by the court only when they are either ""essential to the debtor's business []or . . . to avoid irreparable harm to the estate,"" codifying the right to strike after court-approved interim modifications might jeopardize both the debtor company's existence and its creditors' claims. The proposed subsection would, by its language, also preempt all other federal and state laws regarding labor groups' right to engage in self-help. Under current law, there is no provision for future modifications of a CBA if the debtor's financial condition improves. In negotiations over CBAs, representatives may ask for ""snap-back"" provisions that would provide for future modifications, but the absence of such a provision would not necessarily lead to a court's determination that the representative had good cause for rejecting the debtor's proposal. H.R. 3652 would add a subsection to assure that, based on changed circumstances, representatives could request modifications after CBAs were either rejected or modified. The bill would require the court to grant the request if the change would result in the new provisions being no more than the minimum savings needed for the debtor to reorganize successfully. Assurance of the possibility of future favorable modifications might make representatives more inclined to cooperate with debtors' proposals for modifications. However, under current law, while ""snap-back"" provisions have been available for modifications, they have not been required as part of either a negotiated modification or a court-approved rejection. Currently there is no provision for arbitration rather than a court hearing to rule on a motion for rejection of a CBA. H.R. 3652 would add a subsection to allow arbitration in lieu of a court hearing if requested by the authorized representative, so long as the court finds that arbitration would help the parties reach an agreement that was mutually satisfying. This could reduce the demand for courts' resources; however, only the authorized representative can make the request. The debtor cannot make the request, and the court cannot order arbitration without a request. Using arbitration to resolve a debtor's request to reject a CBA may open greater possibilities for finding a middle ground between complete rejection of a CBA and assumption of the existing CBA. It may also, however, increase the time required to resolve the issue. Under current law, unless otherwise agreed to by the debtor and representative, the court is required to hold hearings on requests for approval of rejection within no more than twenty-one days and to rule on the application no later than thirty days after the beginning of the hearing. As noted earlier, the proposed changes to Â§ 1113 eliminate both of these deadlines. The bill does not directly address which party will pay for arbitration. It appears, however, that if all of the bill's provisions were to become law, the debtor would probably pay for the arbitration as an administrative expense since subsection (j) provides for reimbursing the representative for reasonable costs and fees incurred. Although current law includes provisions for allowing priority claims as administrative expenses for various expenses incurred in reorganization, there is no provision for reimbursing the authorized representative for fees and costs incurred in complying with the requirements of 11 U.S.C. Â§ 1113. The bill would add subsection (j) to make these costs reimbursable upon request and notice and hearing. Under the bill's proposed changes, they would be considered administrative expenses. As administrative expenses, they would be priority claims whose payment in full must be provided for in the plan for reorganization. This provision could result in shorter negotiations or more flexible proposals by the debtor, who would need to balance the cost of continued negotiations with the economic benefit that might be gained through those negotiations. However, it could also lead to more liquidations if administrative expenses increased to the point that they could not be accommodated in a reorganization plan. When a debtor's reorganization plan involves either selling all or part of the business or ceasing some or all of the business, the bill would require the debtor and authorized representative to meet to determine the effects on the labor group. Any accrued obligations that were not assumed as part of a sale transaction would be treated as administrative expenses. Under current law, all post-petition obligations that are required by the CBA are considered administrative expenses. Additionally, where a CBA has been assumed, accrued pre-petition obligations under the CBA may also be administrative expenses. Although the bill would remove the word ""assume"" from 11 U.S.C. Â§ 1113(a), it would add a subsection that would clearly state that assumption of CBAs are treated as are other executory contracts and assumed under 11 U.S.C. Â§ 365. In its findings, the bill states that Congress finds that chapter 11 was enacted ""to protect jobs and enhance enterprise value for all stakeholders,"" but is, instead, being used to ""caus[e] the burdens of bankruptcy to fall disproportionately and overwhelmingly on employees and retirees."" Revising the process for rejection of CBAs is one of the ways this bill proposes to rectify the inequities it asserts. For many companies in bankruptcy, expense for employees is the largest expense in the budget, and some modification of that expense may be essential to their successful reorganization. Section 1113, as it currently exists, has provided labor groups with protection from debtor companies' unfettered rejections of CBAs, but has also provided a method for debtor companies to reject CBAs when they could not reach a compromise with the authorized representatives of the labor groups. The proposed revisions to section 1113 would constrain both debtor companies and the courts when debtors file under chapter 11. The bill clearly contemplates allowing labor groups to have a greater, possibly definitive, role in determining the feasibility of reorganization. Labor groups, but not debtors, would be allowed to request arbitration rather than a court hearing to determine approval of a debtor's request to reject a CBA. In certain circumstances, the bill would allow labor groups to obtain future relief due to changed circumstances without having to bargain with the company. The bill would also extend the right to strike to all labor groups whenever a CBA was modified or rejected without their consent. Finally, the bill provides labor groups with a defined remedy for rejection of a CBA, though courts might differ in their interpretation of that remedy. Companies in financial distress may argue that the bill's proposed changes to chapter 11 are insufficiently flexible to allow successful reorganization. If that is their conclusion, they might try to resolve their financial difficulties outside of bankruptcy or choose to liquidate rather than reorganize.","Introduced in the 110 th Congress, the Protecting Employees and Retirees in Business Bankruptcies Act of 2007 ( H.R. 3652 ) proposes a number of changes to the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. According to the sponsors, the changes are needed to remedy inequities in the bankruptcy process and to recognize that employees and retirees have a unique investment in their companies through their labor. The bill contains many proposals for changing the Bankruptcy Code. This report focuses on the amendments and additions to 11 U.S.C. Â§ 1113, which provides the procedures that are to be followed if a debtor in possession wants to reject a collective bargaining agreement (CBA). The changes proposed for Â§ 1113 may be intended to promote negotiation between the debtor and the authorized representatives of labor groups that have existing CBAs with the debtor company. They also appear to constrain court involvement in the process. This could lead to more agreed-upon modifications and fewer rejections of CBAs. Alternatively, it could prolong the negotiation process and put burdens on the debtor that would make liquidation more feasible than reorganization. The bill prescribes the parameters of offers that may be made by the debtor in negotiations as well as the requirements that must be met before a court can approve rejection. It attempts to curtail what the sponsors have referred to as ""excesses of executive pay"" by making rejection of a CBA difficult if executives are to receive incentive pay and by requiring consideration of past concessions by the labor group in determining whether the labor group is being disproportionately burdened by proposed modifications to a CBA. H.R. 3652 appears to propose changes to Â§ 1113 that would resolve some differences between courts in interpreting the requirements for modification or rejection of a CBA. It also clearly states that rejection of a CBA is a breach of contract, even when approved by the court, and clarifies the damages that are available. The bill provides an absolute right of all employees to strike if their CBA is modified or rejected. This contrasts with recent court decisions involving unions representing employees of financially distressed airlines in which the employees were enjoined from striking.",govreport
"Congressional hearings and press coverage critical of the medical care received by noncitizens in the custody of the Department of Homeland Security's (DHS's) Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) have increased congressional interest in the subject, including the introduction of legislation related to detainee health care. An overarching debate on this issue concerns the appropriate standard of health care that should be provided to foreign nationals in immigration detention. The medical care required to be provided to detainees is outlined in ICE's National Detention Standards, and the Division of Immigrant Health Services (DIHS), which is detailed from the U.S. Public Health Service to ICE is ultimately responsible for the health care of noncitizens detained by ICE. However, the Florida Immigrant Advocacy Center has reported that problems with access to medical care is one of the chief complaints of aliens in detention. Similarly, the National Immigrant Justice Center states that complaints about access to medical care are a constant theme in conversations with detained aliens. In addition, the U.S. government recently admitted negligence in the death of Francisco Castaneda, a former ICE detainee. Thus, although standards exist, one of the questions raised is are the standards being followed? This report begins with an overview of noncitizen detention and then examines the procedures and policies related to the provision of health care to detainees. The report concludes with a discussion of the issues surrounding detainee health care. The report does not investigate the veracity of claims of substandard medical care made in the press or ICE's rebuttals. The law provides broad authority to detain aliens while awaiting a determination of whether they should be removed from the United States, and mandates that certain categories of aliens are subject to mandatory detention (i.e., the aliens must be detained) by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). Aliens not subjected to mandatory detention can be paroled, released on bond, or continue to be detained. Any alien can be detained while DHS determines whether the alien should be removed from the United States. Although some detainees are criminal aliens, others are asylum seekers who have not committed a crime, and others are aliens who are present without status (illegal aliens) who, while in violation of their immigration status and immigration law, have not committed a criminal offense. In addition, some of the criminal alien detainees are legal permanent residents who have resided in the United States for many years. Other detained aliens include those who arrive at a port-of-entry without proper documentation (e.g., fraudulent or invalid visas, or no documentation), but most of these aliens are quickly returned to their country of origin through a process known as expedited removal . The majority of aliens arriving without proper documentation who claim asylum are held until their ""credible fear hearing"" and then released; however, some asylum seekers are held until their asylum claims have been adjudicated. Although noncitizens in immigration detention are in the custody of ICE, only a minority are detained at facilities owned or fully contracted by ICE. In October 2007, 65% of noncitizen detainees were detained at state and local prisons, 19% at contract facilities, 14% at Service Processing Centers (SPCs) owned and operated by ICE, and 2% at Bureau of Prisons (BOP) facilities. Notably, all facilities housing immigration detainees must comply with ICE's National Detention Standards (discussed below). On an average day, up to 33,000 immigration detainees are in ICE's custody in more than 300 facilities nationwide. The average stay is 37.5 days. For FY2008, as of December 31, 2007, the average daily detained population was 31,244. In FY2008, approximately 311,000 aliens were detained by ICE. As of April 30, 2007, ICE reported that, cumulatively, 25% of all detained aliens were removed within four days, and 90% within 85 days. Nonetheless, in FY2006, more than 7,000 aliens were in detention longer than six months. For FY2006, approximately 48% of the aliens in detention were criminal aliens. (For a more detailed discussion of the detention population, see Appendix A .) Currently, ICE contracts with Creative Corrections, L.L.C., to perform the annual inspections of detention facilities. ICE also contracts with another company, the Nakamoto Group Inc., to serve as on-site, full-time quality assurance inspectors at the 40 largest detention facilities. The Detention Facilities Inspection Group (DFIG) within the ICE's Office of Professional Responsibility (OPR) is primarily responsible for oversight of detention facilities. The DFIG, which began in February 2007, provides oversight and independent validation of the annual detention facility inspection program (done by Creative Corrections). DFIG also conducts investigations of serious incidents involving detainees. Lastly, DRO's Detention Standards Compliance Unit is tasked with ensuring that facilities that detain aliens comply with ICE's National Detention Standards. The press has reported that a DHS Inspector General's 2008 draft report finds that previous oversight has not been effective in identifying serious problems at the facilities. The US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), Office of Detention and Removal Operations (DRO) is responsible for ensuring safe and humane conditions of confinement for detained aliens in federal custody, including the provision of reliable, consistent, appropriate and cost-effective health services. —Immigration and Customs Enforcement In 2000, the former Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) created National Detention Standards for aliens in detention, which are published in the Detention Operations Manual. In late 2008, ICE—reportedly with input from detention experts, non-governmental organizations, and DHS' Civil Rights and Civil Liberties Office—published new Detention Standards in a performance-based format. The standards specify the detention conditions appropriate for immigration detainees. In most cases, the standards mirror American Correctional Association (ACA) standards, though some of ICE's Detention Standards provide more specificity or are unique to the needs of alien detainees. The Detention Standards, however, do not have the force of law, thus detainees do not have legal recourse for violations of the standards. The Detention Operations Manual contains a section on health services, which addresses standards for medical care; hunger strikes; suicide prevention and intervention; and terminal illness, advanced directives, and death. The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and the National Immigration Law Center have complained about the standards. They note that ICE lacks written guidelines for how to rate a facility's adherence to the Detention Standards, and that ICE notifies the facilities 30-days before their annual reviews, giving facilities opportunities to prepare for the reviews. In addition, they note that annual reviews do not require detainee interviews and are only observational reviews of the facilities and files. In 2007, the Assistant Secretary of ICE directed that ICE's Office of Detention and Removal (DRO) report semiannually on agency-wide adherence with the National Detention Standards. The semiannual reports explain the standards used to rate the detention facilities. The first report under this directive was issued in May 2008. According to ICE's Detention Operations Manual the Detention Standards ensure, ""that detainees have access to emergent, urgent or non-emergent medical, dental, and mental health care that are within the scope of services provided by the DIHS, so that their health care needs are met in a timely and efficient manner."" According to the Detention Operations Manual, every facility has to provide detainees with initial medical screening, primary medical care, and emergency care. The ICE Officer in Charge (OIC) must arrange for specialized health care, mental heath care, and hospitalization within the local community. All facilities are required to employ a medical staff large enough to provide basic exams and treatments to all detainees. Medical care at facilities ranges from small clinics with contract staff to facilities with on-site medical staff and diagnostic equipment. The facilities are required to have a mechanism (normally paper request slips) that allows detainees to request health care services provided by a physician or other qualified medical officer in a clinical setting. The facilities are required to have regularly scheduled times, known as sick call , when medical personnel are available to see detainees who have requested medical services. All detainees, without exception, have access to sick call, and the facilities have to have procedures in place that ensure that all sick call requests are received and triaged by medial personnel within 48 hours after the detainee submits the request. ICE detainee policy requires that all detainees receive an initial health screening immediately upon arrival at the detention facility to determine the appropriate necessary medical, mental health, and dental treatment. In addition to the initial screening, ICE policy also requires that detainees receive a health appraisal and physical examination within 14 days of arrival to identify medical conditions that require monitoring or treatment. In addition, all detainees are supposed to receive a mental health screening within 12 hours of admission. Detainees also receive a mental status evaluation during their physical examination, which is required to take place within 14 days of admission. According to ICE, a detainee with a medical condition will be scheduled for as many follow-up appointments as necessary. In addition, detainees have access to sick call (i.e., the opportunity to request non-emergeny health care provided by a health service provider during scheduled times at the detention facility). In addition, the manual states that an initial dental screening exam should be performed within 14 days of the detainee's arrival, and if an on-site dentist is not available, the initial dental screening may be performed by a physician, physician's assistant, or nurse practitioner. All detainees are afforded authorized emergency dental treatment. Aliens detained for more than six months are eligible for routine dental treatment. Detainees' dental care, reportedly, is often limited to extractions, and care for painful dental conditions is often delayed or denied. Dentures are not provided, nor are eyeglasses, unless the glasses were broken while the alien was in detention. In addition, detainees may not use their own money to get medical or dental care. Under the Medical Standards, detainees also have access to medication from an on-site pharmacy or a pharmacy in the community. Detainees may get medicine from their family members, provided that the medicine can be verified as appropriate for the detainee to take and is not contraband. There have been reports, however, of detainees having problems getting medications even when their families have been willing to provide them. The Division of Immigrant Health Services (DIHS), which is indefinitely detailed from the U.S. Public Health Service to ICE, is ultimately responsible for the provision of health care to noncitizens detained by ICE. At 15 of over 300 detention facilities, DIHS provides on-site health care, while in the others, mostly for detainees in local prisons and jails, health care is provided by contract workers who are not affiliated with DIHS. The amount of care available on-site at detention facilities is variable. Some facilities have full-time, on-site medical staff, while other facilities make use of local providers. Notably, DIHS is responsible for the approval of any off-site medical care, regardless of where the alien is detained. Some immigration advocates maintain that since the Detention Standards do not have the force or law or regulation, DIHS policy exercises the largest influence over the provision of medical care to detainees. Although the medical care that is supposed to be received is detailed in the Detention Standards Manual, one stated concern is that the procedures and standards are not followed. Another concern focuses on the covered benefits package (discussed below) and whether that and the Detention Standards allow for the provision of adequate services to the detained populations. DIHS is a stand-alone medical unit consisting of U.S. Public Health Service (PHS) Officers and contract medical professionals who work under DIHS supervision. DIHS serves as the medical authority for ICE. Prior to October 1, 2007, ICE received the medical services of DIHS through the Department of Health and Human Services's (HHS's) Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA). In other words, HRSA oversaw DIHS, including the U.S. Public Health Service Officers assigned to DIHS. According to DHS, ICE was interested in greater administrative control over DIHS for a variety of reasons, including HRSA's inability to fill DIHS vacancies in a timely manner and unwillingness to provide Public Health Service (PHS) Officers to support ICE law enforcement missions. In October 2007, DIHS was detailed indefinitely to ICE. The detail of the PHS Officers in DIHS was accomplished via a memorandum of agreement (MOA), which also covers the assignment of PHS resources elsewhere within DHS. Since the detail became effective, ICE has provided both administrative support to DIHS and oversight of the administration of DIHS. Under the MOA, DHS is responsible for the day-to-day conduct of PHS Officers under its detail and assumes liability for their negligence or malpractice. Lawyers in the DHS Office of Health Affairs (OHA) handle such claims. In addition, beginning on October 1, 2007, ICE has stated that it has been collaboratively working with OHA on a variety of improvement initiatives, including selecting a new Director for DIHS at the appropriate rank; implementing aggressive hiring strategies to address staffing needs; identifying and implementing a new electronic medical records system; and reviewing (or changing, if necessary) the process by which Treatment Authorization Requests (TARS) are approved. ICE is also working with OHA to develop an enhanced process for TAR appeals. ICE has established a covered benefits package that delineates the health care services available to detainees in ICE custody, in addition to the minimum scope of services provided by the detention facilities. This package, known as the DIHS Medical Dental Detainee Covered Services Package (CSP), primarily provides health care services for emergency care, which is defined as ""a condition that is threatening to life, limb, hearing or sight,"" rather than elective or non-emergency conditions. The CSP states that: [accidental] or traumatic injuries incurred while in the custody of ICE or BP [Border Patrol] and acute illnesses will be reviewed for appropriate care. Other medical conditions which the physician believes, if left untreated during the period of ICE/BP custody, would cause deterioration of the detainee's health or uncontrolled suffering affecting his/her deportation status will be assessed and evaluated for care.... Elective, non-emergent care requires prior authorization.... Requests for pre-existing, non-life threatening conditions, will be reviewed on a case by case basis. Detainees who require non-emergency medical care beyond that which can be provided at the detention facilities must get preauthorization. They submit a Treatment Authorization Request (TAR), which is evaluated by the DIHS Managed Care Program. The TAR must be approved before the detainee may receive care. According to ICE, more than 40,000 TARs are submitted each year; the average turn-around time is 1.4 days, and 90% are approved. Nonetheless, some detainees have described waiting weeks or months to get basic care. In addition, reportedly, detainees have been told that biopsies were ""elective surgery"" and, as such, have had trouble getting the diagnostic test. According to a 2007 GAO report, officials at several detention facilities reported difficulties obtaining approval for outside medical and mental health care. TAR reviews for care are conducted by DIHS nurses in Washington, DC, who review the paperwork submitted by physicians. These nurses are known as Managed Care Coordinators (MCCs). The nurses are on duty Monday through Friday, 7:30 a.m to 4 p.m. Regardless of where the alien is held, approval from DIHS is required for diagnostic testing, speciality care, or surgery. However, when an ICE detainee is hospitalized, the hospital assumes medical decision-making authority, including the patient's drug regimen, lab tests, X-rays, and treatments. Off-site medical care for people in the custody of the U.S. Marshals service is handled in a similar manner. According to ICE, DIHS has a formal appeals process that is similar to industry standards and comparable to that of the Bureau of Prisons for declined Treatment Authorization Requests (TARs). Facilities and individual detainees have the right to appeal denial determinations. TARs denied for lack of medical necessity may be resubmitted for reconsideration to the Managed Care Coordinator (MCC) (i.e., the DIHS nurses in Washington DC). If a TAR is denied for lack of timely submission, the medical records are forwarded to the Managed Care Coordinator (MCC) Branch Chief for review. According to DIHS Standard Operating Procedure, the Managed Care Review Committee (MCRC) conducts a second level review for all appeals which are upheld by the MCC. The MCRC is comprised of the DIHS Medical Director, appropriate medical, dental, or mental health consultants, and MCC(s). Decisions of the MCRC are made in writing within three working days of the appeal. ICE, DIHS, and OHA are working to develop a more independent appeal body outside of DIHS and ICE. The preauthorization (also called pre-certification of medical necessity) requirement is similar to those of many managed care/health insurers. Nonetheless, some contend that this procedure can prevent detainees from getting the necessary care, and note that off-site nurses have the ability to deny care that was requested by on-site medical personnel. Reportedly, the DIHS Medical Dental Detainee Covered Services Package (CSP) has been amended several times since 2005, to limit the scope of medical care for detainees. A repeating theme in press reports and congressional testimony concerned difficulties getting biopsies when there is a concern about cancer. The ACLU is involved in a class action suit regarding inadequate medical care for immigration detainees at the San Diego Correctional Facility, and contends that there are serious deficiencies in the CSP which should be fixed to ensure that detainees receive adequate medical care consistent with the ICE Detention Standards on Medical Care. The CSP primarily provides health care services for emergencies only. According to the ACLU, as recently as August 2005, the CSP did not extend to pre-existing conditions. In his testimony, Tom Jawetz of the ACLU argued that there is a disconnect between ICE's Detention Standards and the CSP. In addition, he contends that ""the standard is inconsistent with established principles of constitutional law and basic notions of decency."" Representative Zoe Lofgren also stated in a question to ICE at the October 2007 hearing that there seems to be an inconsistency between the CSP and the Detention Standards because the CSP states that medical conditions will be evaluated for treatment based on the criteria that, ""if left untreated during the period of ICE/BP custody [the medical condition] would cause deterioration of the detainee's health or uncontrolled suffering affecting his/her deportation status [emphasis added],"" (i.e., the detainees health issues would have to jeopardize the ability of ICE to remove the alien before treatment would be rendered.) ICE responded that it disagrees that the Detention Standards and CSP are inconsistent. ICE contends that all detainees receive medical treatment when DIHS determines that care is required, ""regardless of whether the alien is about to be deported or not."" There have been reports of problems with detainees being transferred without their medical records. ICE does not have a system to track the transfer of medication and medical records of detainees. Some lawyers described difficulties getting access to medical records on their client's behalf. Other detainees have complained about problems with getting interpreters during medical treatment. Female detainees have also reported not getting regular gynecological or needed obstetric care. The following section synthesizes the finding in three U.S. government reports that examined selected detention facilities' compliance with all or some of the National Detention Standards. All three reports examined compliance with the Medical Care standard. The reports are as follows: U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Office of Detention and Removal (DRO), Semiannual Report on Compliance with ICE National Detention Standards: January—June 2007 , May 9, 2008. Government Accountability Office (GAO), Alien Detention Standards: Telephone Access Problems Were Pervasive at Detention Facilities; Other Deficiencies Did Not Show a Pattern of Noncompliance, GAO-07-875, July 2007. Department of Homeland Security, Office of the Inspector General (DHS OIG), Treatment of Immigration Detainees Housed at Immigration and Customs Enforcement Facilities , OIG-07-01, December 2006. Table 1 presents the time period of the reviews, the number of facilities reviewed, and the total number of standards evaluated for the studies discussed. In May 2008, ICE released its first semiannual report on compliance with the National Detention Standards. The report covers reviews conducted during the first six months of 2007 and includes the inspections of more than 175 facilities. The report rated the facilities on the Detention Standards as either ""acceptable"" or ""deficient."" Overall, on the medical care standard, 98% of the facilities were rated acceptable, while 2% were rated deficient. Of the evaluated Service Processing Centers (SPCs) owned and operated by ICE, 80% were rated acceptable, while 20% were rated deficient. In July 2007, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) released an audit of 23 detention facilities. GAO found a lack of adherence to the medical care standards at 3 of the 23 facilities, including failing to administer the mandatory physical exams within 14 days of admission and failure to administer medical screening immediately after admission. In addition, GAO found that concerns about medical care were common reasons for aliens to file complaints. The DHS Office of the Inspector General (OIG) conducted an audit of compliance with selected detention standards at five facilities used to house immigration detainees. Of the five facilities reviewed, DIHS managed and administered health care at two facilities. At the other three facilities, DIHS was responsible for approving off-site care, but the on-site care was administered by contractors at those facilities. The OIG identified instances of non-compliance with the medical care standards at four of the five detention facilities, including failure to provide timely initial medical care. The one facility found to be in full compliance with the standards for initial medical screening and physical examination was Krome SPC, where medical care is provided by DIHS. The OIG stated in its review that the Detention Standards on sick calls do not clearly define what is considered a timely response to a non-emergency sick call request. Thus, the report found that in the absence of standards, local detention facilities have established differing policies regarding response time to non-emergency care. Nonetheless, at three of the detention facilities (two local prisons and one contract facility), 196 out of 481 detainee non-emergency medical requests were not responded to in the time-frame specified by the facility. As a result, the OIG recommended that ICE develop specific criteria to define a reasonable time for medical treatment. ICE responded to the recommendation, concurring in part and promising to examine the merits of the issue, but contending that its medical program provides adequate detainee care and is consistent with industry standards. ICE also stated that it ""must rely on its service providers to make medical decisions regarding the provision of medical care and any criteria to be established that would determine timeliness."" Reports of inadequate care being provided to detainees raise several policy issues pertaining to the health care provided to the detained noncitizen population. First, the detention population, both in funded bed space and in the total detention population, increased between FY2003 and FY2007 raising interest in spending on detainee medical care, and concerns that spending has not increased in the same proportion as the detained population. In addition, ICE has the authority to release aliens due to medical and psychological problems, elevating interest in the existing guidelines and practices for medical release, and their adequacy. Similarly, due to the likely special needs of asylum seekers in detention, another policy issue focuses on whether proper care is and can be provided to this population within a detention setting. While every death is regrettable, preventable deaths of aliens in detention who are reliant on the government for medical care heighten concerns about the quality of health care. Doubts about the propriety of the number of deaths in detention as a reliable measure of standard of care, lead to the policy question of which measures would provide insight into the adequacy and quality of care. Finally, an overarching debate on this issue concerns the appropriate standard of health care that should be provided to foreign nationals in immigration detention. This debate is especially emotional because of the balancing act between basic human rights and the cost of health care when U.S. citizens also face barriers in accessing health care. Concerns about the adequacy of health care for detained aliens has increased interest in funding for detainee medical care. As shown in Table 2 , from FY2003 to FY2007, the total amount spent on detainee medical care increased by 83%, from $50 million to $92 million. During that same time period, the total amount of funded bed space increased by 41%. The total amount of funds spent on ICE detainee health care increased between FY2003 and FY2004. Between FY2004 and FY2006, the total expenditures on detainee health care fluctuated but remained between $70 and $74 million. Between FY2006 and FY2007, the total expenditures increased from $74 million to $92 million. Most of the increase in total spending on detainee health care was from increases in program operations, not in medical claims, which are for services rendered by an off-site health care provider to detainees. The total amount of money spent on detainee health care program operations doubled between FY2003 and FY2007. However, the funds expended for medical claims increased between FY2003 and FY2004, then decreased between FY2004 and FY2005. Between FY2005 and FY2007, expenditures on medical claims remained almost constant. During the same time, the funded amount of bed space increased by 49%. ICE has the authority to release aliens due to medical and psychological problems; however, how often this authority is exercised and whether it is used effectively is unknown. ICE has prosecutorial discretion in determining custody for aliens with humanitarian (including medical) concerns. The alien may be released into an Alternatives to Detention program, released on an Order of Supervision, or released on his or her own recognizance. These decisions are made on a case-by-case basis, ""whenever a medical or psychiatric evaluation makes the alien's detention problematic and/or removal [from the United States] unlikely."" ICE does not keep track of how often this discretion is exercised. While there is general debate about the merits of detaining asylum seekers, asylum seekers often have medical and psychological issues and it is not clear how well-equipped the detention health care system is to deal with the specific physical and psychological needs of asylum seekers. As discussed, aliens in expedited removal must be detained, and thus aliens in expedited removal who claim asylum are detained while their ""credible fear"" cases are pending, and they may then be detained while their case is decided. In FY2006, 5,761 asylum seekers were detained, and 1,559 (27%) were detained for more than 180 days. Notably, some claim that the practice of detaining asylum seekers has helped reduced the number of fraudulent asylum claims. However, the position of the United Nations High Commission on Refugees is that detaining asylum seekers is ""inherently undesirable."" It argues that detention may be psychologically damaging to an already fragile population such as those who are escaping from imprisonment and torture in their countries. Often, the asylum seeker does not understand why he or she is being detained, which can increase psychological stress. In addition, asylum seekers may have unusual medical conditions resulting from the imprisonment and torture suffered in their home countries. Nonetheless, ICE reports that it routinely provides medical care for life-threatening conditions, such as cardiac arrest, kidney disease, HIV/AIDS, hypertension, and diabetes. As discussed earlier in the report, according to ICE detainees receive dental care, physical exams, sick call visits, prescription drugs, and mental health services. ICE states that staff are trained to spot detainees who may be at risk of suicide, and to use prevention and intervention techniques to assist such detainees. Between May 2007 and May 2008, psychologists and social workers have managed a daily population of over 1,350 seriously mentally ill detainees without a single suicide. Thus, current ICE procedures may adequately address the health care needs of detained asylum seekers. Two policy issues become highlighted when a detainee dies in custody. The first issue concerns the quality of oversight when a death occurs and whether there is enough oversight to identify possible cases of inadequate care. Secondly, while a detainee's death may heighten concerns about the quality of health care, there are doubts about the propriety of using deaths in detention as a reliable measure of standard of care. What follows is a discussion of these two issues. Although there is a system to report the death of a detainee, some question whether there is effective oversight when a death occurs in detention. Current ICE procedure dictates that when a detainee dies while in the custody of ICE's Detention and Removal Office (DRO), the death is to be reported to ICE headquarters via a system known as the Significant Event Notification (SEN) system. Under its proceedures, DRO is also supposed to report detainee deaths to the ICE Office of Professional Responsibility (OPR) and to the DHS Office of the Inspector General (OIG) so that they can conduct independent reviews of the incident. In addition, deaths are referred to the local medical examiner's office, which decides whether to perform an autopsy. The OIG is also notified of the death by the Joint Intake Center (JIC), which is notified by the SEN system and sends all records regarding the death (including those from the local medical examiner) to the OIG. The OIG may accept the case for investigation or may decline and refer the case back to the JIC for referral to the Office of Professional Responsibility. ICE has reported a decline in the number of deaths of aliens in detention between 2004 and 2008. Some, however, question whether mortality rates should be used in appraising health care in a transitional population, and truly reflect the quality of care provided to detainees. In May 2008, ICE published a fact sheet reporting that there were 71 deaths in immigration detention facilities from calendar year 2004 (inclusive) through May 2, 2008 (see Table 3 ). ICE reported a decline in the number of detainee deaths between 2004 and 2008, a period when the detainee population increased. ICE also asserted that the mortality rate in its facilities is lower than in U.S. prisons and jails and the general U.S. population. A critical analysis of the death rates was published by physicians at the New York University School of Medicine, who commented that ICE's comparisons were not valid because, among other things, the respective mortality rates had not been adjusted for age or for length of detention. These doctors stated that mortality is an imprecise method for appraising health care in a transitional population, and that morbidity which refers to sickness or having a disease would be a better measure of ICE healthcare. They also stated that, in their calculations, the length-adjusted mortality rate for detainees increased between 2006 and 2007. In addition, critics of the reported death rates stated that those who die outside the facilities but whose deaths were precipitated by their time in detention are not included in the mortality rates. There is debate about the appropriate standard of care that should be provided to aliens in detention. Many U.S. citizens lack health insurance and face barriers in accessing health care, and there are issues of patient safety in many medical settings, not just in correctional facilities. In addition, a proportion of aliens are in detention who are not authorized to be in the country. The cost of care for aliens in detention is paid by the American taxpayer. Reportedly, the health care provided to detained aliens tends to be similar to that provided to those in criminal incarceration. According to a press report, ICE has argued that some aliens are getting better health care in detention than they would in their home countries and that they had received earlier in their lives. Assistant Secretary of ICE, Julie Myers testified that in FY2007, 34% of detainees screened were diagnosed with and treated for preexisting chronic conditions (e.g., hypertension, diabetes), and many of these detainees would not have known of their medical condition or received treatment if it were not for the comprehensive health screening they obtained when entering the detention system. In addition, some health care decisions need to be made with the consideration that the alien is going to be removed to a country where he or she may not be able to get any follow-up care. Some contend that despite ICE's acknowledgment of the substantial burden of chronic diseases among the detained population, the ICE health plan focuses on an acute care model, and is not crafted for a population with significant chronic medical or mental health needs. Some aliens in detention, especially long-term residents, do have health insurance but are unable to use it. Some further allege that officers frequently view ICE detainees as criminals, even when they do not have a criminal record, and as such are sometimes quick to assume that the detainees are faking their illnesses, and sometimes slow to get the aliens care. Appendix A. Detention Statistics On an average day, up to 33,000 immigration detainees are in ICE's custody in more than 300 facilities nationwide. The average stay is 37.5 days. In FY2007, a total of 311,213 aliens were detained by ICE. As of April 30, 2007, ICE reported that, cumulatively, 25% of all detained aliens were removed within four days, 50% within 18 days, 75% within 44 days, 90% within 85 days, 95% within 126 days, and 98% within 210 days (see Table A -1 ). For FY2006, approximately 48% of the aliens in detention were criminal aliens. As Figure A -1 shows, the average daily detained population increased between FY2003 and FY2004 and then decreased between FY2004 and FY2006. The daily average detained population increased significantly between FY2006 and FY2007, from 20,594 to 30,295 detainees. As of December 31, 2007, the average daily detention population for FY2008 was larger than the FY2007 average daily population. For FY2008, as of December 31, 2007, the average daily detained population was 31,244. As illustrated in Figure A -1 , the total number of aliens detained by ICE during the fiscal year was fairly consistent between FY2003 and FY2005, and then increased in both FY2006 and FY2007. In FY2007, ICE detained 79,713 (34%) more noncitizens than in FY2003. Some of the increase in the total annual detention population was due to the expansion of expedited removal. Aliens in expedited removal are mandatorily detained but tend to be in detention for shorter periods of time than other aliens because they are not entitled to the same judicial review as aliens who are not subject to expedited removal (i.e., who are in removal proceedings under INA §241). Appendix B. Legislation in the 110 th Congress The Consolidated Security, Disaster Assistance, and Continuing Appropriations Act, 2009 ( P.L. 110 - 329 ) appropriated $2 million for the Office of Professional Responsibility to undertake an immediate comprehensive review of the medical care provided to ICE detainees. The Act also directed ICE to immediately implement the Government Accountability Office's recommendation to improve medical services. The Detainee Basic Medical Care Act of 2008, H.R. 5950 , was introduced by Representative Zoe Lofgren on May 1, 2008. The companion bill, S. 3005 , was introduced by Senator Robert Menendez on May 12, 2008. The bills would have required the Secretary of Homeland Security (DHS) to establish procedures for the timely and effective delivery of medical and mental health care to immigration detainees, designed to ensure continuity of care throughout the alien's detention. The procedures would have been required to address all health needs, including but not limited to primary care, emergency care, prenatal care, dental care, eye care, and mental health care. The procedures would have to have been designed to ensure that each detainee received a comprehensive medical and mental health screening upon intake; each detainee received a comprehensive medical and mental health examination and assessment within 14 days after arrival at the detention facility; each detainee taking prescribed medications was allowed to continue taking such medications on schedule and without interruption; and each detainee with a serious medical or mental condition, subject to immigration laws, been given priority consideration for release on parole, bond, or an alternative to detention program. The procedures would also have been required to ensure that medical records are accessible by the detainee or his or her designate, and were transferred if the detainee was moved to another detention facility. Also, H.R. 5950 / S. 3005 would have required the procedures to include ""discharge planning"" for aliens with serious medical or mental health conditions to ensure continuity of care, for a reasonable period of time, upon removal or release from detention. The bills would also have required the Secretary of DHS to establish an administrative appeals process for denials of medical or mental health care. The process would have included the opportunity to appeal the denial of services to an impartial board. H.R. 5950 / S. 3005 would have required that the Secretary report to the Inspector Generals of the Departments of Homeland Security and Justice information regarding a detainee's death no later than 48 hours after the death of the detainee. The bills would have also require an annual report to Congress detailing any detainee deaths during the previous fiscal year.","Congressional hearings and press coverage critical of the medical care received by those in the custody of the Department of Homeland Security's (DHS's) Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) have raised interest in the subject. The law provides broad authority to detain aliens while awaiting a determination of whether they should be removed from the United States and mandates that certain categories of aliens are subject to mandatory detention by DHS. Aliens not subject to mandatory detention may be detained, paroled, or released on bond. The medical care required to be provided to aliens detained in ICE custody is outlined in ICE's National Detention Standards, which address standards for medical care; hunger strikes; suicide prevention and intervention; and terminal illness, advanced directives, and death. According to ICE's Detention Standards, ""All detainees shall have access to medical services that promote detainee health and general well-being."" In addition, every facility has to provide detainees with initial medical screening, ""cost-effective"" primary medical care, and emergency care. The Division of Immigrant Health Services (DIHS), which is detailed indefinitely from the U.S. Public Health Service to ICE, is responsible for the health care of noncitizens detained by ICE. In some detention facilities, DIHS provides all medical care; in others, DIHS is responsible only for approving medical services that are not provided by the detention facility. ICE has established a covered benefits package that delineates the health care services available to detainees in ICE custody. Detainees who require non-emergency medical care beyond that which can be provided at the detention facilities must submit a Treatment Authorization Request (TAR) to the DIHS Managed Care Program. TARs are reviewed by DIHS nurses in Washington, DC, who review the paperwork submitted by physicians and decide whether to allow the treatment. There have been press reports and congressional testimony of individuals in ICE custody who apparently received inadequate medical care. In addition, problems with access to medical care is one of the chief complaints of aliens in detention. However, others state that immigration detainees may receive better health care than some U.S. citizens, and assert that the death rate in ICE custody is lower than that of the prison and general populations. Overall, there seem to be two major policy questions: (1) do the Detention Standards and the covered benefits package allow for the provision of adequate services to the detained populations; and (2) are the procedures and standards for the provision of medical care being followed? The report does not investigate the veracity of claims of substandard medical care made in the press, or ICE's rebuttals of such claims. This report will be updated to reflect legislative activity.",govreport
"On January 23, 2004, President Bush signed into law the Consolidated Appropriations Act,2004 ( P.L. 108-199 ) within which Congress authorized the creation of the Millennium ChallengeAccount and appropriated $994 million for FY2004. The MCA legislation, included in Division Dof the omnibus spending bill, resolved several key issues on which the House and Senate differed. The measure creates a new Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC), headed by a CEO whoreports to the Board of MCC Directions, instead of the Secretary of State (Senate) or the President(House). The Board includes the Secretary of State (chairman), the Secretary of the Treasury, theU.S. Trade Representative, the USAID Administrator, the MCC CEO, and four others from listssubmitted by congressional leaders and nominated by the President. Low-middle income countriesmay participate in MCA programs beginning in FY2006, as proposed, but may not receive more than25% of MCA appropriations. The legislation creates a roughly 90-day period during which theCorporation will name the list of countries that will compete for MCA selection in the first year(""candidate countries""), publish the methodology that will be used for identifying best performingcountries, seek public comment on the initiative, and consult with Congress. Following this reviewperiod, countries will be selected (""eligible countries"") and invited to submit program proposals forfunding. This could take place as early as May 2004. In a speech on March 14, 2002, at the Inter-American Development Bank, President Bushoutlined a proposal for the United States to increase foreign economic assistance beginning inFY2004 so that by FY2006 American aid would be $5 billion higher than three years earlier. Hefurther pledged to maintain economic aid amounts at least at this level into the future. The fundswould be placed in a new Millennium Challenge Account (MCA) and be available on a competitivebasis to a few countries that have demonstrated a commitment to sound development policies andwhere U.S. support will have the best opportunities for achieving the intended results. These""best-performers"" will be selected based on their records in three areas: Ruling justly -- promoting good governance, fighting corruption, respecting human rights, and adhering to the rule of law. Investing in people -- providing adequate health care, education, and other opportunities that sustain an educated and healthy population. Pursuing sound economic policies that stimulate enterprise and entrepreneurship -- promoting open markets, sustainable budgets, and opportunities for economicgrowth. If fully implemented, the initiative would represent one of the largest increases in foreign aid spending in half a century, outpaced only by the Marshall Plan following World War II and the LatinAmerica-focused Alliance for Progress in the early 1960s. Administration officials characterize theMCA as representing the most comprehensive policy change ever in how the United States designs,implements, and monitors development assistance to low and lower-middle income nations. Inparticular, Executive officials emphasize the ""results-based"" aspect of the initiative in whichcountries will be selected based on past and current performance, and programs will be evaluatedon and required to show measurable achievements that impact favorably on economic growth andpoverty reduction. Conditioning assistance on policy performance and accountability by recipient nations is not a new element of U.S. aid programs. Since the late 1980s at least, portions of Americandevelopment assistance have been allocated by the U.S. Agency for International Development(USAID) to some degree on a performance-based system. What is significantly different about theMCA is that the entire $5 billion money pool -- which is nearly twice the size of the FY2003USAID ""core"" development aid budget -- will be tied to performance and results. Moreover,program proposals will be based on national development strategies developed by the countriesthemselves, with a U.S. role limited to providing technical assistance in project design. Further, inanother major departure from past policy, the MCA is intended to focus exclusively on developmentgoals without being influenced by other U.S. foreign policy and geo-strategic objectives that oftenstrongly influence U.S. aid decision making. Nevertheless, while new details regarding countryeligibility, selection criteria, and organizational structure were announced in December 2003, manyissues have not yet been decided and remain under review by the Executive branch. Congress plays a key role in the approval of the initiative by way of considering authorization and funding legislation, and in confirming the head, or CEO, of the Millennium ChallengeCorporation that manages the MCA under the President's plan. Congress will also maintaincontinuing oversight of the program as it is implemented and additional funding is sought insubsequent years. Among numerous policy issues for Congress raised by the MCA proposal were: Country eligibility : Should the MCA target both low and lower-middle income countries, as proposed by the Administration, or should it focus exclusively on the poorestnations where the needs are the greatest and where access to other financial resources is limited? And, if both, how should funds be allocated between the two groups? Performance indicators and selection process : Will the indicators and the methodology proposed by the Administration identify the ""best performers""? Implications for other U.S. development aid programs : How will the MCA affect global and country aid programs not part of the new initiative? U.S. organizational structures: Is the proposed Millennium Challenge Corporation, with a staff of 100, the most appropriate structural model for managing the MCA? What are the implications for the U.S. Agency for International Development, the primarygovernment bilateral aid agency? Program development and selection: What types of activities should the MCA fund and how will these programs be designed? Legislative and funding matters: What should be the relationship between MCA authorizing legislation and current foreign aid laws and legislative practice? What are thebudgetary implications on the MCA? The concept of the Millennium Challenge Account is based on the premise that economic development succeeds best where it is linked to sound economic and good governance policies,especially where these conditions exist prior to expanding resource transfers. Past failures ofeconomic aid provided by the United States and other international donors, some argue, have beencaused to a large extent by a lack of attention to performance and the requirement for measurableresults. (1) Executive branch officials say that theMCA abandons the process of basing aid allocationson promises by recipient governments to initiate policy changes in the future, and instead will makethose decisions based on achievements already made and policies that are currently working. (2) This view has been joined by a growing body of literature in the late 1990s concluding that there was little relationship between the amount of development aid provided and success in raisingeconomic levels and reducing poverty. Rather, some researchers argued that foreign assistanceproduced the greatest impact where the recipient country had already adopted sound policies. (3) Others have concluded that international development assistance has largely failed and will continueto do so unless the donor community fundamentally shifts its focus to support real policy change. (4) Despite many development successes in such areas as agricultural production and childimmunization, by one calculation 97 countries receiving $144 billion (constant dollars) in U.S. aidsince 1980 had their median per capita gross domestic product (GDP) decline from $1,076 to $994by 2000. (5) Also influencing the debate over the launch of a new foreign aid initiative are the terrorist attacks of September 11and an evaluation of their causes. There remain differences of perspectiveregarding a possible direct relationship between poverty and terrorism, especially given the fact thatmany terrorist leaders come from relatively wealthy backgrounds. But most agree that poverty canbe a contributing factor. President Bush, in announcing the MCA on March 14, 2002, madenumerous references to the war on terrorism, noting that ""We also work for prosperity andopportunity because they help defeat terror."" He further emphasized that although poverty does notcause terrorism, ""poverty prevents governments from controlling their borders, policing theirterritory, and enforcing their laws. Development provides the resources to build hope and prosperity,and security."" (6) Accompanying this was a renewed interest in global development aid funding levels as governments, international institutions, and non-governmental organizations prepared for amid-March 2002 U.N.-sponsored International Conference on Financing for Development inMonterrey, Mexico. Conference proponents hoped the session would serve as a catalyst for donorsto increase aid commitments in order to achieve by 2015 the ambitious goal of reducing poverty byone-half relative to 1990. At the 2000 Millennium Summit, international leaders, including theUnited States, had pledged support for a set of specific targets, including those related to hunger,education, women's empowerment, child health, HIV/AIDS, and other infectious diseases, thatbecame known collectively as the Millennium Development Goals. A World Bank analysis, releasedFebruary 2002, estimated that to achieve these goals by 2015, donors would need to increasespending by $40 to $60 billion per year, or roughly double the amount provided in 2001. (7) As theMonterrey conference approached, international development advocates began pressing participatinggovernments to issue specific pledges that would help close this funding gap identified by the WorldBank. Following the President's speech in March, an inter-agency team, including representatives from the National Security Council, Office of Management and Budget, State Department, USAID,and the Department of Treasury, met frequently to work out proposals to design and implement theU.S. initiative. The NSC managed overall policy development while the State Department tookcharge of outreach -- seeking input from the non-governmental community -- and the TreasuryDepartment assembled economic and governance indicators that would be used to determine eligiblecountries. The team drafted recommendations on many, but not all MCA issues, and after beingapproved by the Secretaries of State and Treasury, the proposals were forwarded to the President. After making further modifications, on November 25 President Bush endorsed several key principles of the initiative. Thereafter, the process of writing legislation, deciding on budget levelsfor FY2004, and consulting with Congress began. On February 3, 2003, the President proposed $1.3billion for the MCA in FY2004, followed two days later by submission of a draft bill authorizing theinitiative. The requested legislation was introduced as H.R. 1966 and S. 571 , but ultimately enacted as part of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2004 (Division D of P.L.108-199 ). While several important issues have been decided, both through enactment of authorizing legislation and through inter-agency discussions, others remain under review as the MCA frameworkevolves. These issues are highlighted below and discussed in more detail in the following sectionon the MCA and congressional consideration. MCA features announced by the Administration. The Administration issued proposals on a number of key MCA elements, some of which wereincorporated into the enacted authorizing legislation: Country eligibility. In the first year -- FY2004 -- countries that can borrow from the World Bank's International Development Association (IDA) with a per capita incomebelow $1,415 are eligible. The list will expand to 115 over the next two years to include allcountries with per capita GNI less than $2,935. (For complete list, see appendixB.) Selection criteria and performance indicators. MCA participants will be selected based on their performance measured by 16 economic and political indicators. In mostcases, a score above the group median on the indicator would represent a passing ""grade"". The MCABoard of Directors will be guided by the statistical outcomes, but maintain some discretion over thefinal selection. Corruption measure is ""pass-fail"". To be eligible, a country must score above the median on the corruption indicator, as compiled by the World BankInstitute. Program development and submission. MCA programs will be ""country-driven"" in which participating country officials will design and submit project proposalsbased on national development objectives. Types of programs supported. MCA programs will be available not only for government-sponsored projects, but for activities proposed and implemented by local governmentsand communities, civil society, and other private entities. National governments, however, wouldremain responsible for the program and be the party to sign a compact between the U.S. and thecountry. Moreover, according to Administration officials, all types of assistance -- budget supportfor government initiatives, infrastructure projects, and more targeted activities focused on specificsectors -- are available for consideration. Organizational management of the MCA. The Administration asked and Congress approved the creation of a new entity -- the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC)-- that will be supervised by a Board of Directors chaired by the Secretary ofState. FY2004 funding. The Administration proposed $1.3 billion for the MCA's first year and continues to support its pledge of $5 billion by FY2006. Congress, however, reducedthe FY2004 funding to $994 million. MCA issues undecided within the Administration. Beyond some of these key decisions, other matters remain under discussion. Number of countries participating. Because the MCA will be a ""performance-driven"" program, it is difficult to predict how many nations will qualify andparticipate. Administration officials have suggested, however, that the number will be relativelysmall -- perhaps less than 20 by the third year. It is also undecided whether all or only some of thecountries that qualify based on the performance indicators will receive MCA funding. The final listmay comprise selections from the pool of best performing countries or the selection could be basedon the quality of program proposals submitted by qualifying nations. Other options are also underreview. Impact on USAID program objectives in MCA countries. MCA participants may or may not continue to receive regular development aid under existing USAIDprograms. If they do, it is unclear whether those activities will change focus in order to supportMCA projects. The role of USAID missions in MCA countries is also yet to be clearlystated. Monitoring and accountability. Executive officials say that MCA programs will be closely monitored and scrutinized, perhaps by some independent auditing system, but theyhave not established plans or procedures. Graduation or exit strategies. A main objective in providing an increased resource pool to help ""jump-start"" or accelerate a country's development process, is to set it on theroad toward graduation. What criteria to use to end programs in successful countries or how towithdraw from a non-performing MCA participant remain undecided. As Congress considered MCA authorizing legislation and funding recommendations in 2003,and will later debate the confirmation of the MCC chief officer, followed by continuing oversightof program implementation, several key elements of the initiative have been, and will continue tobe closely examined. These will include matters that have already been decided within the executivebranch, as well as issues that remain under discussion. One of the first questions addressed by the executive steering committee was where the income cutoff point should be drawn for purposes of defining potential MCA participants. The debatechiefly focused on whether only the poorest nations should be considered for MCA programs. Asnoted above, the Administration announced in late November 2002 that a pool of 115 countries,phased in over three years, would compete for MCA resources. They are grouped into three clustersaccording to income level and World Bank borrowing status, with a new cluster added to thecompetition each year corresponding to the anticipated rise in MCA resources. In FY2004, only the75 IDA-eligible countries with per capita incomes below $1,415 can compete, while 12 more willbe added the next year. (8) By FY2006, when $5 billionis planned for MCA programs, countries withper capita incomes between $1,415 and $2,935 -- 28 in number -- will be added. Since countriesabove $1,415 per capita income are likely to score higher on the eligibility indicators, the WhiteHouse further has decided to have separate competitions for the low and low-middle income groupsto avoid income bias. Issue: Income eligibility. There emerged at the outset a relatively broad consensus within the U.S. development community that the MCA shouldfocus on IDA-eligible, low-income countries. (9) Fora policy aimed at promoting economic growth and reducing poverty, mostagreed that it made sense to place emphasis where the greatest needs existed. By expanding thenumber and income level of MCA participants beyond IDA-eligible status, some argued, the amountof money available for the poorest nations would be reduced. Some also noted that the 28 memberlow-middle income group includes nations that maintain strong political and strategic ties with theU.S. -- Egypt, Jordan, Colombia, Turkey, and Russia. That would increase the possibility, or atleast the perception, that countries might be selected on criteria other than MCA performancemeasures. It may further tend to blur the distinction between MCA goals and objectives of other aidprograms, jeopardizing the unique approach of the MCA and the need for programmatic flexibility. (10) Achieving economic results as an objective has frequently taken a position secondary to strategicinterests in U.S. aid allocation considerations in the past. In addition, some point out that the poorest countries have far less access to capital from private sources, making MCA resources even more valuable to them. According to one analysis, aid as apercent of gross national income (GNI) for IDA-eligible countries with per capita incomes below$1,415 totals 10.8% compared with 1.4% for the higher income group (below $2,935); gross privatecapital flows as a percent of GDP for the poorer IDA-eligible countries (below $1,415) is 6.9% whilethose between $1,415 and $2,935 receive 10.3%. Tax revenues and domestic savings as a percentof GDP among low-middle income countries are roughly double the level of those for IDA-eligibleborrowers below $1,415, thus providing a more expansive potential source of financing. (11) Others, however, argue that low-middle income countries deserve equal consideration in a program intended to identify and partner with the ""best-performers."" In some cases, they assert,commitments to sound policies have enabled nations to move into the higher income range. If aprimary goal of the MCA is to maximize the effectiveness of aid resources, then non-IDA countriesshould be included. (12) In addition, countries fallingin the $1,415 - $2,935 per capita income range,while maintaining higher income levels, also have large numbers of people living in poverty. Thesecountries, with stronger institutions and better capacity may also be better positioned to apply MCAresources more effectively. One argument of those favoring exclusive participation of countries below the $1,415 level -- that better-off economies would score higher on the eligibility indicators, raise the median standardsfor qualification, and squeeze out the poorest nations -- seems to be addressed by theAdministration. Based on a preliminary estimate of the median scores of each group, the medianwould be higher -- and in some cases significantly higher -- for 14 of the 16 indicators forlow-middle income countries compared with those below $1,415 GNI per capita. (13) In FY2006, whenthe 28 higher-income countries become eligible, they will be evaluated separately from the other 87,competing against each other to score above the group median on the 16 indicators. This wouldallow countries to qualify based on comparisons with their income-level peers. Whether theAdministration will divide MCA resources into two pots of money for each income group has notbeen determined. In any case, unless the Administration and Congress agree to increase the MCAbeyond the proposed $5 billion target, whatever number of low-middle income nations that qualifywill reduce the amount of resources that would otherwise be available for those below the $1,415level. Congressional proposals to modify income eligibility. Reflecting the perspective that the MCA should remain focused on thepoorest countries, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee recommended in S. 1160 (as added to S. 950 ) to permit participation by low-middle income country in FY2006and beyond only if MCA funding exceeds $5 billion. If not, MCA programs could only be supportedin countries that fall below the ""historical per capita income cutoff of the International DevelopmentAssociation,"" a level that is currently $1,415. Even in years when the MCA appropriation exceeds$5 billion, the Senate bill would limit funding to low-middle income participants to 20% of the totalamount. The Foreign Relations Committee further expressed its intention that MCA programs inthe low-middle income countries should focus on poor communities in those nations. The House International Relations Committee, in H.R. 1950 , also limited to 20% the amount of MCA resources that could be allocated in FY2006 to low-middle income participants. But unlike the Senate, the House measure did not require an appropriation in excess of $5 billion forinclusion of the low-income group in FY2006. The Committee considered two amendments duringmarkup related to the income issue. The first, offered by Congressman Payne and approved by theHouse panel, would have required low-middle income countries that are selected for MCA grantsto make a contribution from their own resources to whatever MCA programs are funded. Thesecond amendment, proposed by Congressman Menendez, originated out of concern that few (7)Latin American nations would be eligible to compete for MCA resources in the first two years,despite large pockets of poverty in these countries. The Menendez amendment, which was defeated(10-24), would have made low-middle income nations, a group which includes nine from LatinAmerica eligible from the beginning. Similarly, Congressman Kolbe proposed an amendment duringHouse floor debate that would have allowed low-middle income countries to be eligible beginningin FY2005 rather than FY2006. The Kolbe amendment failed 110-313. While sympathetic to theconcerns expressed by sponsors of the amendment, those opposed to changing the income eligibilitystructure argued that resources diverted from Latin America and many other nations would come atthe expense of the world's poorest nations where the needs are greatest. As enacted in Division D of P.L. 108-199 , the MCA authorizing legislation follows the earlier House and Senate plan of including only low-income countries in the program during FY2004 andFY2005. Beginning in FY2006, low-middle income nations, with per-capita income above $1,415,may also participate, but they can only receive 25% of the amount appropriated for the MCA in thatyear. Executive branch decisions on which performance indicators to use have been guided by whether the data and methodology are transparent, publically available, accurate, and easy tounderstand. Another key factor is whether the data source provides full coverage for as manycountries as possible and is relatively current. Officials further sought to identify indicators thatwould be few in number but sufficient to reflect broad policy results in each of the three policycategories, and valid relationships between the indicators and economic growth and povertyreduction. Finding indicators that meet all of these requirements is difficult, and according to some,impossible. Gathering valid economic, social, and political statistics, especially in developingnations, has always been difficult, often resulting in significant gaps in coverage and long lag times. Gaining consensus on whether a given set of indicators accurately measures policy achievementsunfettered of institutional bias by whatever organization or individuals collect and interpret the datais also a major challenge. As noted above, the Administration has settled on 16 indicators for measuring performance and determining country eligibility. As shown in Table 1, six fall within each of the ruling justly andencouraging economic freedom categories, while four will determine results in the area of investingin people. Sources include international institutions, such as the World Bank, IMF, and U.N., andnon-governmental and private organizations like Freedom House, Heritage Foundation, and theInstitutional Investor Magazine. National statistics will also be drawn upon where gaps occur, butnone of the data sets will be compiled by the U.S. government. For aggregating country scores, the Administration decided to use a ""hurdles"" approach instead of adding up the results and ranking nations top to bottom. To qualify, a country must score above the median on half of the indicators in each policy area; in other words, a country's ranking must beabove the median of all 75 countries in the first year on three of the six indicators for ruling justlyand economic freedom, and two of the four for investing in people. The one exception to the medianstandard is the inflation indicator -- a country's inflation must be below 20 percent in order to passthat hurdle. Officials believe that the hurdle methodology will demonstrate that a country iscommitted in all three areas and more precisely identify policy weaknesses. In year three andbeyond, when low-middle income countries are added to the competition, there will be separateevaluations for countries below and above $1,415 per capita incomes so that higher income countrieswill not drive up the median and exclude poorer nations from qualifying. Importantly, one indicator -- control of corruption -- will be a ""pass-fail"" test, in which any country scoring at or below the median on this measure will be disqualified regardless ofperformance on any of the other 15 indicators. Executive officials argue that since there are stronglinks between financial accountability and economic success, a strong commitment to fightcorruption must be demonstrated by all MCA participants. Further, after passing all the required hurdles, a country's score will be evaluated by the MCC Board of Directors who will make the final recommendations to the President. The Board will begranted a degree of discretion in selecting the final participants, taking into account such things asmissing or old data, trends in performance, and other information that might reflect on a country'scommitment to economic growth and poverty reduction. Moreover, officials have yet to decidewhether to fund programs in all countries that qualify and pass the final review. Final selection, forexample, could hinge on the quality of program proposals submitted by the best performing nations,although other selection options are also under discussion. Presumably, the President will alsomaintain flexibility as to whether to agree with the Board's recommendations. Congressional action on performance indicators. Measures considered in the Senate and House ( S. 1160 , as amended and incorporatedinto S. 925 ; and H.R. 2441 , as amended and incorporated into H.R. 1950 ) did not directly legislate the list of performance indicators to be used,thereby allowing the executive branch to apply the measures that it has recommended. Both,however, provided for advance congressional consultation and public awareness. S. 925 required that the list of proposed indicators be published in the Federal Register and on theInternet and that the Administration consider public comment prior to issuing the final determinationof the indicators. In this way, the Committee believed that the indicators could be refined andimproved. H.R. 1950 required the Corporation's CEO to consult with congressional committees prior to establishing eligibility criteria and methodology and publish such criteria oncefinalized. Both bills further directed that country eligibility would be based on an evaluation ofperformance criteria that closely matched the 16 indicators listed in Table 1 below. In its report on S. 1160 , the Senate Foreign Relations Committee expressed its intent that the selectionbe based on development needs and performance, and not on immediate political considerations. The enacted legislation, like earlier House and Senate bills, does not specify the specific performance indicators. In describing the criteria by which countries should be assessed, the MCAAct makes reference to the extent to which countries respect the rights of people with disabilities,promote the sustainable management of natural resources, and invest especially the health andeducation for women and girls. While none of the 16 indicators chosen by the Administrationdirectly address these three additional concerns, it is likely that MCC officials will review existingindicators or search for new performance measure in order to better evaluate progress on these threefactors added by Congress. The legislation further requires the Corporation to publish the eligibilitycriteria and methodology used for country evaluation on its website and in the Federal Register , andreceive public comment and congressional input prior to country selection decisions. Table 1. MCA Performance Indicators Issue: Association of performance indicators with economic growth and poverty reduction. Analysts will beexamining the set of 16 indicators to determine how well they predict successfuldevelopment outcomes. An initial assessment by the Center for Global Developmentsuggests that many of the indicators show a reasonable or strong relationship witheconomic growth, infant mortality, and literacy rates, although a few show weakassociations, especially in the economic freedom category. According to the Center'sanalysis, each of the six governance indicators maintains good or strong correlationto development outcomes. The measure of public primary education spending as apercent of GDP, however, is weakly associated with the three development standards. Three of the six economic freedom indicators -- trade policy, days to start a business,and three-year budget deficits -- are also found in the study as being weaklycorrelated with development achievements. (14) Issue: Hurdles and median vs. aggregated ranking. Some argue that an aggregation of scores andtop-to-bottom ranking rather than the use of hurdles is a better way in which todetermine eligibility with an above-the-median score requirement. While theAdministration holds that passing half the hurdles in each of the three policy areasensures broad commitment to both economic growth and poverty reduction, it alsomeans that countries do not have to meet each of the 16 standards to qualify. Thisapproach departs from more traditional aid requirements in which recipients mustcomply with all conditions associated with a program framework, especially thoseof the World Bank, IMF, and in some cases U.S. aid agreements. Once a countrypasses a hurdle, there are limited incentives to keep improving in those areas. Forcountries that miss qualifying by a small margin, however, the incentive remains. PDF version Use of the median also in some cases complicates efforts for a country to passthe hurdle due to outcomes beyond its control. The median will change over time,sometimes because new countries are added to the pool, as will be the case inFY2005. In other instances, a country may improve on a particular indicator but stillnot pass the hurdle because other countries improve more significantly and push themedian higher. Conversely, a government could regress or remain stagnant over timebut pass a hurdle it had failed the previous year because the median drops. A numberof observers have suggested that instead of using the median, it would be better eitherto set specific, individual thresholds that would be relevant to each indicator or to useabsolute scores. (15) A further issue in use of the median is that for three of the indicators -- political rights, civil liberties, and trade policy -- the range is relatively narrow for scoringcountry performance, resulting in many falling at the median. The Freedom Houseassigns scores on a 1-7 scale, while the Heritage Foundation uses a scale of 1-5. Forthe trade policy indicator, for example, 15 of the 75 IDA-eligible countries areassigned the median score of 4. Since a country must place above the median to passa hurdle, this eliminates a number of candidates with limited differentiation ofperformance. Issue: Surprising country outcomes and modifying the indicators. Many have been surprised by the possibility thatcountries such as Vietnam and China might qualify, despite scoring near the bottomon half of the indicators for ruling justly. Both countries pass the hurdles forcorruption, rule of law, and government effectiveness, but have some of the worstscores in the categories of political rights, civil liberties, and voice andaccountability. Since they score above the median for three of the six indicators andpass the corruption measure, they would qualify, at least in the ruling justly category. One analyst attributes this to the high degree of correlation among several indicators in a single category that tends to magnify existing data deficiencies. Whenhalf the indicators in a single category are strongly related to one another, and acountry scores well in those areas, the other indicators essentially become irrelevant. Egypt is also cited as an example of a country with a poor record on regulation andtrade, but would have passed the economic freedom grouping with data available inearly 2003 based on the strength of macroeconomic indicators. (16) One modification to the current proposal that would address this potential weakness would be to make sure that highly correlated indicators represent less thanone-half the total cluster. In this way, a country would not pass one of the threecategories based on a strong showing in one respect but very poor standards for theother measures. Another alteration to the Administration's plan would be to add anadditional indicator in each category so that there would be an odd number ofmeasurements in each category. In a sense, the added element would become a""tie-breaker"" in cases where the current indicators tended to cluster in two, evenlydivided, highly correlated groupings. One review of the MCA proposal argues thatthe initiative does not include sufficient attention to democracy issues because itincludes indicators in the ruling justly category that are better measures of economic,not political freedoms. This analysis recommends a shift of the corruption, rule oflaw, and government effectiveness indicators to the economic policy category. Under this scenario, countries like Vietnam and China would fail the ruling justly test. (17) Issue: Data accuracy and availability. Due to the difficulty in collecting accurate data,especially those based on perceptions, a certain degree of error can be expected ineach of the 16 measurements. This cannot be overcome but is mitigated to someextent by the requirement of only having to pass half the hurdles in each policy area. But it appears most problematic for the pass/fail test of corruption. According to anassessment made by the authors of the corruption index, there is a large margin oferror and high degree of uncertainty for 25 countries that score slightly above orslightly below the median. Either cross-country data are not informative or sourcesdisagree on a country's corruption standing. Of the total of 25, 13 fall below themedian and would therefore be eliminated from further consideration, despite strongdoubt as to whether the data measured performance accurately. To overcome thispotential weakness, the authors recommend that MCA managers employ in-depthcountry diagnostics regarding governance performance for countries that fall near themedium -- the ""yellow light countries."" (18) Missing data also pose challenges. A strict interpretation of the data would result in a failing grade on a hurdle where no figures were available. Only 87 of the115 possible MCA-eligible countries have been reported with regard to the indicator""days to start a business,"" although the number has increase from 63 a year ago. Forother indicators where data were incomplete or lagged, especially in the cases ofeducation and health spending as a percent of GDP, executive officials say they willrely on information collected at U.S. embassies in each country. Issue: MCA Board of Directors discretionary authority. Allowing the Board some latitude to depart from thepurely statistical record will help address some of the data accuracy and availabilityproblems. But there appears to be divided opinion over how much discretion shouldbe permitted. Arguing for broader flexibility, some note that countries that just miss qualifying, possibly because of the lack of data, could still be reconsidered andapproved. (19) In the case of ""close-calls,"" the Boardcould examine trends over timeto assess if a borderline country was improving or falling back in performance, andmake appropriate adjustments. In order to maintain the integrity and transparency ofthe selection process, final judgments that deviate from the methodological base willneed to be clearly explained and closely examined. (20) This will be especiallyimportant in cases where the country with close strategic and political ties to theUnited States is included despite not meeting all the hurdle tests. The same will betrue should the President decide to reject a country that has recently opposed orrefused to support an important U.S. security-related policy. Others disagree,however, contending that any discretion on the part of the Board would inviteunwarranted political influence and undermine MCA effectiveness. (21) Anotheranalyst argues that one way to avoid undue foreign policy intrusion would be tochannel MCA funds through multilateral entities, such as the World Bank. (22) Congressional proposals to modify Board of Directors discretion. As noted below, the Senate Foreign RelationsCommittee initially reported an MCA authorization bill that did not authorize thecreation of a Millennium Challenge Corporation, with a Board overseeing itsoperations. Instead, S. 1160 placed the MCA within the StateDepartment under the authority of the Secretary of State and gave the Secretary thepower to determine eligible countries through the evaluation of a government'scommitment to several factors in the three areas of ruling justly, economic freedom,and investing in people. Subsequently, however, the Senate voted on July 9, 2003, to modify the MCC structure and the role of the Board of Directors by adopting revised text that waslargely based on a proposal offered by Senator Lugar ( S. 1240 ). Themodified arrangement, which was incorporated as Division C of S. 925 ,established a Corporation to be managed by a CEO. Under the Senate measure, theCEO would report to and be under the direct authority and foreign policy guidanceof the Secretary of State. S. 925 , as amended, further established aBoard of Directors, chaired by the Secretary of State, and grants the Board the powerto determine eligible countries by evaluating the commitment of a country todemocratic governance, economic freedom, and investments in people. This did not,however, appear to limit the Board's selections based solely on the results of theperformance indicators. In this way, the Senate measure seemed to permit a similardegree of discretion that the Administration's plan envisioned. The House-passed measure ( H.R. 1950 ) was similar to the Senate bill in that it required eligible countries to have demonstrated a commitment tobolstering democracy, investing in health and education, and promoting soundeconomic policies, but did not specifically identify how such a commitment wouldbe determined, other than through the creation of eligibility criteria and amethodology. As enacted, the MCA authorizing legislation follows the general themes of earlier House and Senate bills. ""Eligible"" countries are to be determined, to themaximum extent possible, by objective and quantifiable indicators measuring acountry's commitment to the three core policy goals of ruling justly, promotingeconomic freedom, and investing in people. The legislation directs that the selectionis to be based on the consideration of three factors: the extent to which the countrymeets or exceeds the eligibility criteria; the opportunity to reduce poverty andpromote economic growth in the country; and how much money is available to carryout MCA programs. This appears to provide substantial flexibility and discretionaryauthority in the selection process. Where the House and Senate bills diverged, however, regarded who made the determination of eligibility and therefore, who would be in position to exercisediscretion in deviating from a strictly statistical evaluation. S. 925 , asamended on July 9, gave the Board of Directors authority to determine whether acountry is eligible, while H.R. 1950 placed the power with theCorporation's CEO. The enacted legislation gives this authority to the Board ofDirectors. The MCA initiative will be an additional economic assistance tool of the United States, and is not intended to replace or substitute for any existing channel of U.S.foreign aid. It can be expected, therefore, that overall American aid will continue toserve multiple national interests and foreign policy goals, including security,humanitarian, multilateral, and commercial objectives. Administration officials havemade a commitment that the MCA will be in addition to existing aid activities andthat regular U.S. programs will continue even in MCA-participating countries. Nevertheless, because of the priority being placed on the MCA policy orientation andthe size of the financial investment, there almost certainly will be ramifications of thenew initiative for current programs. Foremost may be funding tradeoffs, especiallygiven rising budget deficits and the costs of fighting the war on terrorism. (Spendingissues are also discussed below in the section on legislation and budgets.) Issue: Commitment to global initiatives. During the past year, some analysts have argued that aportion of the MCA should be dedicated to effective and results-oriented globalprograms operated on a multilateral basis. One concern is that the large amount ofresources directed to the MCA may limit the U.S. ability to maintain or expand uponcommitments to such activities as the Global Fund to Fight HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis,and Malaria. Another worry is that soundly managed, high impact programs incountries with weak governance and poor corruption standards will miss out on theMCA opportunity to accelerate a process that is already making a contribution tolong-term economic growth and poverty reduction. Proponents of this view advocatea ""two-tiered"" approach to the MCA in which separate pools -- and perhapsmultiple pools -- are maintained to serve several types of activities. (23) The trade-off for this approach would be that significantly fewer resources per country would be available, most likely reducing the impact of MCA assistance. Some also caution that multilateral programs, regardless of their merits, do notnecessarily have the same results-oriented performance requirements of the MCA,a fact that would undermine the main objective of the MCA. Increased resources areonly one important feature of the new initiative, and to many MCA advocates, themost significant feature by far is the goal of allocating the aid where it will have thegreatest impact and be most readily accounted for. Issue: Policy coherence and USAID program goals in MCA countries. The Administration says it will maintain regulardevelopment aid programs in a country while it simultaneously launches a far largerMCA-designed activity. Executive officials have not said, however, how this mightaffect the shape and goals of continuing programs managed by USAID missions. Some may argue that regular aid objectives should be re-oriented to maintain policyconsistency with the MCA initiative and in some cases to help facilitate the corefocus of the larger pool of resources. Others, especially within USAID countrymissions, may question whether successful projects should be abandoned, with apotential negative impact on the target population. In perhaps the clearest statementto date, USAID Administrator Natsios told the House Foreign OperationsAppropriations Subcommittee that actions may vary from country to country. Henoted that USAID missions in MCA-selected countries would likely undertake astrategic review of their programs and may adjust projects to support the MCAcontract. In other cases, however, missions might continue high-priority activities,such as those combating HIV/AIDS or curbing trafficking in persons, or terminatecertain activities. (24) Some of these same issues regarding policy coherence are being raised regarding the relationship between the MCA and other U.S. economic and trade tools aimed atpromoting economic growth in developing nations. One study, for example,concludes that there is very little overlap between countries likely to qualify for theMCA and those currently eligible for debt reduction under the Heavily Indebted PoorCountry (HIPC) initiative or for trade preferences under the African Growth andOpportunity Act. (25) Congressman Jim Kolbe,Chairman of the House ForeignOperations Subcommittee, the House panel with jurisdiction over funding the MCA,suggests that MCA qualifiers should get special consideration for expedited tradepreferences that would further accelerate economic growth possibilities. (26) Still otherswho support the MCA framework find fault with the Administration for not devisingsimultaneously an overall foreign aid strategy into which the MCA fills one ofseveral elements of a comprehensive policy. (27) Beyond U.S. programs and policies, other foreign aid donors and institutions are expressing concerns that the MCA may be creating additional, and perhapscompeting performance goals to those that already exist. How MCA program goalsalign with the Millennium Development Goals is of particular concern. One of the most contentious issues associated with the MCA policy review process has been and is likely to continue to be where the MCA programmanagement will be placed. This debate has raised issues discussed for many yearsconcerning under what auspices U.S. foreign aid policy should be designed,coordinated, and managed. Over the years, suggestions have ranged fromcoordination within the National Security Council, creation of umbrellaorganizations, like the ill-fated International Development Cooperation Agency, andmost recently the merger of such responsibilities into the State Department. Afterextensive debate during the mid-1990s, a decision was reached to make USAID, theprincipal U.S. government bilateral aid agency, totally independent, but to have itoperate under the guidance of the Secretary of State. After considering numerous options, including the placement of the MCA as a separate unit with the State Department, the Administration proposed to create a newgovernment entity -- the Millennium Challenge Corporation -- to manage theinitiative. Given the innovative and non-traditional approach inherent in the MCAconcept, executive officials said it makes sense to establish a new entity to overseeits implementation. The Corporation, as proposed, would have a CEO, confirmedby the Senate, and a staff of no more than 100 that would be drawn largely from othergovernment agencies and serve for limited-term appointments. A Board of Directors,chaired by the Secretary of State and include the Treasury Secretary and OMBDirector, would oversee the MCC. Although it appears there is no precise existingmodel in the U.S. government, officials said that the MCC would most closelyresemble the Overseas Private Investment Corporation, an organization that promotesprivate American investment overseas, and the Commodity Credit Corporation, anarm of the Department of Agriculture that manages export credit guarantee programsfor the commercial sale of American agricultural goods. An important differencebetween these and the MCC, however, is the proposal to have a cabinet-memberBoard oversee the latter and make final recommendations. Issue: The need for a new organization. Before agreeing on the MCC, the inter-agencysteering committee reportedly looked seriously at the option of creating a separateunit within the State Department to manage the MCA. One reason for rejecting thisproposal may have been the relative lack of experience of State Department staff inadministering aid programs. This was one of the central issues considered when thequestion of whether to fold USAID into the Department was under debate. Thistechnical shortcoming, however, could have been overcome by adopting the MCCprinciple of detailing aid experts from other agencies to staff the office. A broaderreason for not placing the MCA within the State Department, however, may havebeen a concern that it would be located too close to the center of the U.S. foreignpolicy apparatus that would limit the program's immunity from strategic and politicalinfluences. At a minimum, many observers believed, there would be a perceptionproblem -- whether true or not -- that the MCA did not truly represent a departurefrom the past aid entanglements with broad U.S. foreign policy interests. At the same time, many groups encouraged the Administration to establish the MCA as an office within USAID, but apart from the normal operations of the agency. Various external groups have argued that USAID, with its 40 years of developmentexperience, maintained the knowledge, staff, and on-the-ground country presence tomost effectively administer and monitor the MCA. To place responsibilityelsewhere, they contend, would risk duplication of effort, competing priorities, andinconsistent policies. (28) Another, business-relatedorganization also opposes thecreation of a new institution. Rather it recommends the establishment of a ""smallcore office"" (unspecified as to where it would be placed) that would identify programpriorities and distribute the MCA funds to USAID and the Trade and DevelopmentAgency (TDA). (29) Others are skeptical, however, that USAID is best suited to implement the MCA concept. The Agency is frequently criticized as encumbered with excessiveregulations, managed with poor financial systems and time-consuming planningcycles, and burdened by extensive congressional oversight. One analysis, afterweighing both the merits and disadvantages of placing the MCA within USAID,concluded that if the Administration wants the MCA to operate differently than USAID, it should create a new agency to manage it. (30) Congressional proposals to modify the organization structure. Proposals considered by the Senate shifted positions onthe organizational issue as bills moved through the legislative process in 2003. S. 1160 , as reported by the Foreign Relations Committee in May 2003,did not authorize the creation of the MCC, as proposed by the President. Instead, thelegislation designated the Secretary of State as the coordinator of MCA assistanceand directed the Secretary to designate a coordinator within the State Department formanaging the program. The coordinator, who would be confirmed by the Senate,would have authority to develop the list of performance indicators, select eligiblecountries, and to coordinate MCA programs with other donors. The Committee adopted this approach by approving an amendment offered by Senators Hagel and Biden (approved 11-8). The sponsors noted that in 1998Congress had consolidated two independent agencies -- USIA and ACDA -- in theState Department in order to give the Secretary more director authority over all toolsof U.S. foreign policy. To create a separate entity to manage what could become thecornerstone of American foreign assistance, they argued, would run counter to theserecent efforts to better integrate and coordinate foreign policy decision-making. Supporters further questioned what value the OMB Director would provide by beingon the Board of Directors, given that the Director is generally not assignedpolicy-making responsibilities. The Administration strongly opposed the Committee's action to place the MCA in the State Department. At the markup session on May 21, 2003, Chairman Lugarread a letter from Secretary Powell underscoring the value of a new, independent, andcreative entity for managing this ""new start"" to U.S. foreign aid. The Secretary saidthat if this approach remains in the final bill, he would recommend that the Presidentveto the legislation. Senator Lugar, who opposed the Biden-Hagel amendment, proposed an alternative structure in new legislation. S. 1240 , as introduced on June11, would create a Millennium Challenge Corporation, headed by a CEO who wouldreport to the Secretary of State. Senator Lugar intended that such an arrangementwould provide the Corporation with the same degree of independence and status asUSAID, but establish a chain of command that would permit the Secretary of Stateto exercise broad authority over the MCA. S. 1240 created a Board ofDirectors, made up of the Secretary of State (Chairman), the Secretary of theTreasury, the USAID Administrator, the U.S. Trade Representative, and the MCCCEO. The full Senate adopted the general approach proposed by Senator Lugar whenit voted on July 9, 2003, to incorporate a modified text of MCA authorizinglegislation into S. 925 , an omnibus foreign policy authorization bill. The approved text further strengthened the explicit relationship between theCorporation and the Secretary of State by adding that the CEO shall ""report to andbe under the direct authority and foreign policy guidance of the Secretary."" TheAdministration did not express objection to the revised legislation. The House bill, H.R. 1950 , took a somewhat different approach than the modified Senate proposal that was closer to the Administration's position,although with some important differences. H.R. 1950 would create anew Millennium Challenge Corporation sought by the President, but altered thecomposition of the Board of Directors and, as noted above, the authority of theMCC's Chief Executive Officer. The Board would include the Secretary of State asChairman and the Secretary of the Treasury, as proposed, but deleted the Director ofOMB and added the USAID Administrator, the U.S. Trade Representative, and theCEO of the MCC. The bill also included four additional members, to be appointedby the President from a list submitted by the majority and minority leaders of theHouse and Senate. The Board would further include as non-voting ex-officiomembers, the CEO of OPIC, and the Directors of the Trade and DevelopmentAgency, Peace Corps, and OMB. The House measure further created an AdvisoryCouncil that would advise, consult, and make recommendations to the CEO andBoard of Directors for improving the MCA. The Council would include sevenCEO-appointed members from the non-governmental sector, including business,labor, private and voluntary organizations, foundations, public policy organizations,and the academic community. As enacted (Title VI of the Foreign Operations Appropriations Act, 2004, as included in Division D of P.L. 108-199 ), the MCA authorizing legislation combinedapproaches found in both House and Senate bills. The statute creates an independentMillennium Challenge Corporation, headed by a CEO who is confirmed by theSenate and reports to the Board of Directors. The Board consists of the Secretary ofState (Chairman), the Secretary of the Treasury, the USAID Administrator, the U.S.Trade Representative, and the CEO. Four additional individuals will be on the Boardthat ""should"" be named by the President from lists of candidates supplied by theMajority and Minority leaders in the House and Senate. The enacted legislation,however, does not require Advisory Council as proposed by the House. Issue: Role of MCC staff in managing and monitoring the MCA. One of the first concerns of aid managers isthe ability of a 100-staff organization to maintain proper oversight and accountabilitystandards over what will become a $5 billion program. By comparison, USAIDmaintains a staff of nearly 2,000 American direct-hires and several thousand morecontractors and foreign nationals based overseas to implement a roughly $8 billionprogram. Few would argue that a similar work-force is needed -- indeed, therewould likely be minimal support for a bureaucracy even half that size. But with acentral mandate of performance, results, and accountability, the MCA requires astrong monitoring capability. The Administration has mentioned the prospect of anoutside, independent auditing system, but the issue appears to remain unresolved. Even though USAID will not manage the MCA, it is likely that its staff, especially those located in MCA participant countries, will play a supporting role invarious capacities. USAID Administrator Andrew Natsios has told his staff that theAgency's long record of best practices and experience will be required if the MCCis to be successful. But how this will operate in the field is an open question. Thereis concern among some USAID professionals that the time and attention of missionstaff to support administrative, contracting, and procurement needs of MCAprograms will diminish their ability to manage regular aid programs. And asmentioned above, how the current mission portfolio relates to MCA objectives isunclear. Issue: Future of USAID. The creation of a new agency to manage the MCA is likely to be viewed by some as avote of no confidence in USAID. This may stimulate renewed debate over whetherthe USAID mandate should be modified -- perhaps limiting it to a strictlyhumanitarian aid agency -- or folding it into the State Department or the MCC itselfat some future date. USAID supporters are concerned that an MCA managed outsidethe principal U.S. development organization will establish a two-class aid systemwith USAID responsible for addressing the needs of the ""weaker"" performers whilethe main emphasis will transfer to the MCC. The potential impact on staffrecruitment and morale, and eventually resources, they believe, could be serious. Anargument could be made as well, however, that this provides an opportunity forUSAID not only to demonstrate its expertise as an aid organization and serve theMCC as a valued ""consultant,"" but also can serve as incentive to review its ownoperations and correct some of the persistent problems identified by critics. (31) Congressional proposals to modify USAID's role. During legislative consideration of MCA authorizing bills,Congress attempted to clarify the relationship between the MCC and USAID inefforts to minimize overlap and inconsistency of aid policies and operations. Asmentioned above, under both bills the USAID Administrator would become a votingmember of the Board of Directors. S. 925 , as amended, further directedCorporation staff posted overseas to coordinate the MCA program with the USAIDmission director in that country. The legislation also directed USAID to ensure thatagency programs would help prepare potential MCA participant countries to becomeeligible for assistance. Similarly, H.R. 1950 gave USAID the lead role in assisting countries to become eligible in the future that had demonstrated a commitment todevelopment but failed to qualify based on the performance indicators (the so-called""near-miss"" countries). Up to 15% of the amount authorized annually for the MCAcould be made available for such USAID programs. (The Senate measure alsoprovided up to 10% of annual MCA funds be available to countries that failed toqualify because of unreliable data or lack of performance on only one indicator,although the Corporation, not USAID would provide the assistance.) H.R. 1950 also directed the MCC to consult with USAID officialsregarding the contents of a contract -- or Compact -- between the U.S. and an MCAparticipant country, and required that the MCC and USAID coordinate their programsto the maximum extent possible. During House floor debate, Members adopted anamendment by Congressman Kolbe intended to further clarify USAID's role inproviding U.S. economic assistance. The language stated that the USAIDAdministrator shall report to the President ""through, and operate under the foreignpolicy authority and direction of the Secretary of State."" (32) The Kolbe amendmentalso authorized USAID to extend assistance to countries ineligible for MCA aid sothat they may become eligible, and permitted USAID to help in the evaluation,execution, and oversight of the MCA projects. The enacted legislation authorizing the MCA (Title VI of the Foreign Operations Appropriations Act, 2004, as included in Division D of P.L. 108-199 ),specifically addresses the issue of the MCA and USAID relationship. Section 615of the measure requires the CEO to consult with the USAID Administrator, and thatUSAID must ensure that its programs play a primary role in preparing countries tobecome eligible for the MCA. As such, the legislation makes available up to 10%of the MCA appropriation ($99 million in FY2004) for assisting countries thatdemonstrate a ""significant commitment"" to the MCA requirements, but narrowlymiss qualifying. USAID may provide this support. The statute further requiresUSAID to seek to ensure that agency programs play a primary role in helping preparea country that has failed to qualify previously to better compete in the next selectionprocess. With broad agreement that development programs work best when they are designed and therefore ""owned"" by the host country and not imposed from outside,executive officials stress that MCA programs will be country-driven. Once a nationis identified as eligible, it will be invited to draft and submit program proposals forevaluation and selection through the MCC. Projects should directly support broadnational development strategies already in place, preferably constructed withextensive input from civil society. Since several of the possible MCA countries havealready designed such strategies as part of the Heavily Indebted Poor Country (HIPC)debt reduction initiative -- the Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers -- these PRSPsmight serve as the guiding framework for program goals where appropriate. The Administration has outlined numerous types of programs that might be supported by the MCA: budget support for various community, sector, or nationalinitiatives; infrastructure development, commodity financing, training and technicalassistance, and capitalization of enterprise funds or foundations. Selection woulddepend on country-specific circumstances and would not be appropriate in all cases. For example, budget support programs would only be suitable where governmentsmaintain transparent budgeting, accounting, and control systems and have stronggovernance and anti-corruption records. Endowing enterprise funds or foundationsmight be appropriate where other alternatives are weak or where innovative ways offinancing development proposals appear attractive. An eligible country could submit multiple proposals annually, some of which might take several years to implement. The MCC would create a contractualrelationship with selected countries and require the establishment of project performance goals so that progress could be closely monitored. Should performancefall behind or fail, the contract could be declared void and funding cut-off. Issue: Detailing the types and targets of programs. One of the next steps for MCA planners will be to refinemore precisely the nature of programs the MCA will support, who the beneficiarieswill be, and what criteria will be used in making the selection. A number of groups,especially in the U.S. NGO community, have stressed the need to include programsthat will directly support non-governmental and civil society activities that mayoperate independently of the government. Some advocate that the MCC solicitproposals directly from private, non-governmental groups. (33) The Administration appears to be receptive to the principle that MCA funded activities need not support only government-run or sponsored initiatives, but alsocould include projects operated directly by the private sector or NGOs. The draftlegislation submitted to Congress in February 2003 allowed the MCC to issue grantsto both private and public entities. What may be more problematic is the receipt ofproposals straight from these non-governmental sources. This might result in anawkward competitive relationship between government and non-governmentsubmissions, a competition that might be best settled by the country itself prior totransferring recommendations to the MCC. USAID Administrator Natsios told theHouse Appropriations Foreign Operations Subcommittee on May 21, 2003. thatwhile the MCA would likely include programs proposed by non-governmentalentities, the contract would need to be signed by the host government and that thegovernment would be responsible for managing and overseeing the project. Another issue related to the types of programs eligible for MCA resources is the capacity of both the U.S. and participant countries to manage the projects. Budgetsupport, infrastructure, and commodity assistance most likely would be large-scaleactivities where substantial amounts of resources could be invested, thereby reducingthe total number of projects to be managed and monitored. Community-based orNGO projects, on the other hand, likely would be much smaller in size and fundingrequirements, but far more numerous in totality. While supporting the broadest arrayof development programs with MCA funds provides the maximum opportunities,U.S. policy makers will have to decide whether they are prepared to assumeresponsibility for a large number of projects in the MCA portfolio and the associatedmanagement, oversight, and accountability demands. A key principal endorsed by numerous MCA proponents is that programs must be country-owned, designed by a broad spectrum of government and civil society. As noted above, some have suggested that PRSPs that have been developed by manypotential MCA countries could be used as the guiding framework in devisingprogram proposals. (34) Recognizing, however, thatmany MCA countries do not havesufficient capacity to design program proposals on their own, many suggest thatUSAID and others assist -- but do not control -- the development of programsubmissions. (35) Congressional action on program issues. The enacted MCA authorizing legislation permits resourcesto be provided to a wide range of entities, including central governments, NGOs,regional and local governments, and private groups. Assistance may take the formof a grant, cooperative agreement, or contract with any of these eligible entities. Thelegislation requires that the United States enters into a ""Compact"" with a qualifyingcountry that describes the program to be funded, how it will be monitored, and howthe development goals will be achieved. The Compact cannot exceed a five yearcommitment. The measure specifically prohibits assistance for military purposes, forany project that would likely result in the loss of American jobs, for projects thatwould likely cause a significant environmental, health, or safety hazard, or forabortions or involuntary sterilizations. The legislation further sets out the process bywhich the CEO can suspend or terminate a Compact in cases where the country hasengaged in activities contrary to U.S. national security interests, has taken actionsinconsistent with the criteria for determining MCA country eligibility, or has failedto meet the requirements of the Compact. The Administration submitted in early February 2003 draft MCA authorizing legislation and separately proposed $1.3 billion for the first year funding level. Program flexibility, as expected, was one of the key themes integrated throughout thedraft bill. Executive officials said that while the MCA should have its own statutorybase separate from existing laws, including the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961,current restrictions that prohibit U.S. assistance to countries would remain. Theseinclude a lengthy list of potential infractions including those related to human rights,drug production, terrorism, nuclear weapons transfers and testing, military coups,debt payment arrears, and trafficking in women and children, just to name a few. In keeping with the desire for flexibility the draft legislation would make available MCA resources ""notwithstanding any provision of law,"" but with a notableexception. Countries that currently cannot qualify for U.S. assistance under part 1of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 -- that part of the Act authorizing programsfor bilateral development aid, narcotics control, international disasters, the formerSoviet Union, and Central Asia, among others -- would remain ineligible for MCAfunds. However, if the President waived any prohibition under Part 1 for a particularcountry, that nation would then be eligible for MCA resources. (36) Another area of flexibility highlighted in the draft bill concerned personnel and administrative authorities. The CEO of the Corporation would be granted authorityto establish and modify in the future a human resources management system withoutregard to existing laws governing Civil Service and Foreign Service activities,although certain provisions, including merit and fitness principles, cannot be waived. The draft submission further granted the CEO the authority to appoint and terminatepersonnel notwithstanding Civil Service and Foreign Service laws and regulations. The bill would also allow the MCC to transfer MCA resources to any U.S. agency,and would permit the Corporation to draw on the services and facilities of otherfederal agencies in carrying out the program. On the funding question, the Administration expressed a commitment to a $5 billion MCA program by FY2006, although the pace at which resources approachthat figure would be influenced by anticipated demand as well as larger budgetaryconsiderations stemming from competing spending priorities, a growing deficit, andother possible policy initiatives. For FY2004, the President requested $1.3 billion,a figure less than one-third of the three year goal that some had expected. TheAdministration did not provide any projections for FY2005. The President further made a commitment that MCA resources would not be drawn from existing aid programs, but would be in addition to those appropriations,although of course final decisions on appropriations are made by Congress. TheAdministration sought a large -- $2.6 billion, or 16% -- increase in ForeignOperations Appropriations programs for FY2004, including the MCA funds, butsome areas of the proposal, especially for bilateral development assistance programs,fell below current amounts for FY2003. Issue: Flexibility and congressional directives and oversight. An issue that has been heatedly argued between Congressand all Administrations for many years has been the practice of congressionallegislative directives and earmarks in foreign aid authorization and spending laws. Executive officials argue that the excessive use of such directives, both formal andinformal, seriously erodes their ability to manage foreign policy and operate acoherent foreign aid program. Most in Congress view the use of directives and earmarks, however, as a legitimate tool for congressional participation in setting foreign aid policy andspending priorities. Some Members point to congressional emphasis in recent yearson initiatives such as child health, basic education, and international HIV/AIDS,programs that both the Clinton and Bush Administrations subsequently came toembrace and support with higher budget requests. Without congressional pressurethrough earmarks, U.S. commitment and leadership on these policies would not existto the extent they do today, many argue. Moreover, some contend that these broad,sector allocation directives represent priority-setting decisions by lawmakers andreflect the appropriate and constructive power of Congress to manage the federal""purse."" It is the far more targeted earmarks, they contend, benefitting specialinterests or specific organizations and firms, that are problematic from theExecutive's perspective. The dispute over congressional foreign aid directives is unlikely to be resolved during any MCA debate. However, the distinctive nature of the MCA initiative provided the Administration with a different set of arguments against earmarks. Because of the demand-based, results-driven concept of the MCA, executive officialscontended that the traditional pattern of congressional directives -- specifyingfunding amounts for selected countries or activities, and placing restrictions oncertain operations -- would undermine the basic principles of the MCA concept. Legislative set-asides for a particular set of countries or for certain program activitieswould arguably undercut the transparent, objective process of selecting thebest-performers. In settling these differences, one model to examine might be how Congress authorizes and funds other demand-driven programs in the annual Foreign Operationsappropriation bill. Since it is not known in advance who may request or requiresupport under programs such as the Export-Import Bank, the Trade and DevelopmentAgency, or international disaster assistance, Congress generally appropriates amountsthat are expected to be needed to meet the resource demands placed on theseactivities, with few or no set-asides for specific requirements. Authorizing laws forthese programs include some restrictions, but are generally not nearly as extensiveas those for regular bilateral economic and military aid programs. An importantdifference, however, between such programs and the MCA is that their purpose is farmore narrowly defined than that of the MCA. Linking existing foreign aid eligibility requirements with the MCA drew broad support within Congress, since many of those requirements reflect fundamental socialand political values and were congressionally initiated. But the prospect of applyingto an MCA participant these overarching aid prohibitions, especially those thatrequire an Administration discretionary determination to trigger the aid cut-off, raiseda new set of issues. Would, for example, the extent to which the U.S. has a majorfinancial investment in a successful MCA project influence a decision on whether todeclare the government in violation of narcotics cooperation standards? Congressional action on flexibility and oversight issues. For the most part, the enacted MCA authorizing act refrainsfrom earmarking, providing authorities consistent with MCA principals set out by theAdministration, and permitting the executive to implement the program with a degreeof flexibility. The measure authorizes assistance ""notwithstanding any otherprovision of law."" However, countries which are ineligible for American economicaid due to restrictions contained in the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 or any otherprovision of law cannot be selected for MCA support. This provision will likelyeliminate consideration of a number of countries, although in most cases thesecountries would most likely be weak performers under the MCA selection criteria. Moreover, as noted above, assistance may not result in the loss of American jobs,displace U.S. production, pose a major environmental, health, or safety hazard, beused for military support, or finance abortions or involuntary sterilizations. Thestatute also adds several requirements aimed at strengthening congressional oversightof the MCA. The legislation requires the Secretary of State to post information aboutthe MCA in the Federal Register and on the Internet, and to submit an annual reporton MCA operations. Issue: Funding and possible tradeoffs. Following submission of the FY2004 budget, MCAadvocates closely examined two funding issues: the size of the MCA request andproposals for other U.S. economic aid programs. Many believed that MCA resourcesshould and would grow in equal amounts of $1.67 billion per year to reach the $5billion total in three years. Conflicting Administration statements gave credibilityto the view that this was the intention, although officials have said more recently thatthis is not the case. For one reason, since the number of qualifiers the first year isstill far from certain, the funding requirements may be quite different from $1.67billion. In addition, the budget environment was much different than it was in March 2002 when the President issued his policy statement. Budget deficits had risen,creating greater pressure to hold spending down in nearly all areas. Such pressuresare likely to continue throughout future budget debates, making the task ofaccommodating a new and large funding initiative more difficult. One way to manage MCA increases would be to rearrange overall foreign aid spending priorities and reduce amounts elsewhere. But the President said theAdministration would not take that path. While the FY2004 budget request largelymaintained funding for other foreign aid programs at existing levels -- although witha few important exceptions -- congressional appropriators faced limitations in theirability to fully provide for both the MCA and other aid accounts. The effects of awar in Iraq and unanticipated foreign policy contingencies arising later in 2003created new resource demands. When Congress decided on different appropriationpriorities than the President and allocated a smaller amount to the Foreign Operationsfunding bill, it set the stage for direct trade-offs between the MCA and competingsecurity, economic, and humanitarian activities. In addition, the MCA was not theonly Foreign Operations program that was vying for increased spending for FY2004. The President's budget included several other new initiatives, including those foradditional HIV/AIDS resources, ""topping up"" the HIPC debt reduction initiative, acontingency funds addressing famine and conflict needs. While the overall requestfor Foreign Operations was well above FY2003 enacted levels -- up 16% -- thesenew initiatives accounted for most of the increase, leaving continuing programs witha more modest 3.6% rise. Some foreign aid proponents were especially concerned about reductions in the President's FY2004 budget for development assistance and global health programs. Compared with the Administration's request for FY2003, the FY2004 budgetblueprint was the same -- a combined $2.96 billion total for these ""core"" bilateraldevelopment aid activities. But due to Congressional additions, the FY2003 levelshad increased to $3.23 billion, making the FY2004 request 8% less than enactedamounts for FY2003. Some argued that these, and similar reductions below FY2003appropriations for refugees, disaster, and food aid, broke the President's pledge tomake the MCA an additional source of funding. In order to reach a conclusion,however, one would have to know whether funds proposed for the MCA would bemade available for accounts supporting similar activities if this new initiative was notsubmitted. It is unclear that in the absence of the MCA or any of the other newinitiatives, that an equivalent amount of resources would have been made availablefor other bilateral economic aid programs. Congressional proposals to modify MCA funding levels. Throughout the 2003 debate over MCA authorization andappropriation funding amounts, Congress struggled with the challenge of fullyfunding the President's $1.3 billion MCA request and addressing other foreign aidpriorities. Senate bills ( S. 1160 and S. 1426 ) authorizedand appropriated $1 billion for the MCA in FY2004. The authorization furtherprovided for $2.3 billion in FY2005 and $5 billion for FY2006. In the House, H.R. 1950 authorized $1.3 billion, while H.R. 2800 appropriated $800 million. As enacted in Title VI of the Foreign Operations Appropriations Act, 2004 (included in Division D of P.L. 108-199 ), authorizations for MCA appropriations forFY2004 and FY2005 are set as ""such sums as may be necessary."" Elsewhere in thesame Act, Congress provides $1 billion for MCA appropriations in FY2004, $300million less than requested. (37) This appropriationreduction may affect the number ofcountries and program proposals selected for FY2004, and the pace at which theinitiative would move forward towards the $5 billion goal by FY2006. Throughout this report, Congressional recommendations to alter key elements of the President's MCA initiativeare discussed. The table belowsummarizes these changes. a. The status of the Senate bill is based on S. 925 , the Foreign Affairs Act, Fiscal Year 2004, as amended during debate on July 9 and 10. S. 925 remains pending in the Senate. Previously, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee had approvedlegislation authorizing theMillennium Challenge Account in S. 1160 . A modified text of S. 1160 was subsequently incorporatedinto S. 925 as Division C on July 9. The House bill, H.R. 1950 , is also a combined foreign policy authorization measureto which earlier MCAauthorizing text was added. The House International Relations Committee had reported H.R. 2441 , whichwas incorporated, withmodifications, to H.R. 1950 , and passed by the House on July 16. For many years, the United States has been criticized by other nations andinternational development organizations for not contributing enough to fight globalpoverty and promote economic growth. Although the United States was the largestprovider of Official Development Assistance (ODA) (38) until the early 1990s and wassecond to Japan in most years since until 2001, its contribution has been at or nearthe bottom of the list of international donors when measured as a proportion ofnational wealth. Figure 1. ODA Performance 2002 The United States defends its record as a development aid provider, arguing that contributions to global poverty reduction should not be measured simply in terms ofaid transfers as a percent of GNP. (39) U.S. officialsnote that in dollar terms, AmericanODA has remained substantial, and is programmed on more favorable terms than thatof other donors. The United States, they emphasize, was a leading voice over thepast several years in the Heavily Indebted Poor Country (HIPC) debt initiative, beingthe first government to advocate 100% cancellation of bilateral debt owed by theworld's poorest nations. American charitable organizations and businesses providea significant proportion of annual aid transfers and private investment to thedeveloping world. Given the large amount spent by the United States on defense andthe security it provides to allies and friends around the world, American contributionsto global stability and a stable environment in which economic development can takeshape is much larger than ODA expenditures suggest, they contend. In the coming years, if Congress continues to appropriate funds for the MCA initiative that are in addition to other ODA resources, the dollar value of U.S. ODAwill increase -- perhaps significantly -- especially if other new foreign aid programs,like the Global HIV/AIDS Initiative, proceed as planned. The Administration saysthat the MCA would add 50% to U.S. ODA contributions, and while that figure maynot be reached by FY2006, it is likely to be in the 25-40% range. But on the otherpoint of measurement -- ODA as a percent of GDP -- the impact will not be sodramatic, largely because MCA appropriations are likely to be very small relative tothe size of the U.S. economy and because of projected GDP growth estimates overthe next several years. According to current projections, assistance would rise fromthe 2002 level of 0.12% of GDP to 0.15%.

World Bank Annual Report, 2003. ","In a speech on March 14, 2002, at the Inter-American Development Bank, President Bush outlined a proposal for the United States to increase foreign economic assistance beginning inFY2004 so that by FY2006 American aid would be $5 billion higher than three years earlier. Thenew funds, which would supplement the roughly $16.3 billion economic aid budget for FY2003,would be placed in a separate fund -- Millennium Challenge Account (MCA) -- and be availableon a competitive basis to a few countries that have demonstrated a commitment to sounddevelopment policies and where U.S. support is believed to have the best opportunities for achievingthe intended results. These ""best-performers"" would be selected based on their records in three areas -- ruling justly, investing in people, and pursuing sound economic policies. Development of a new foreign aid initiative by the Bush Administration was influenced by a number of factors, including the widely perceived poor track record of past aid programs, recentevidence that the existence of certain policies by aid recipients may be more important for successthan the amount of resources invested, the war on terrorism, and the March 2002 U.N.-sponsoredInternational Conference on Financing for Development in Monterrey, Mexico. The MCA initiative is limited to countries with per capita incomes below $2,935, although in the first two years -- FY2004 and FY2005 -- only countries below the $1,415 level would competefor MCA resources. Participants will be selected based on a transparent evaluation of a country'sperformance on 16 economic and political indicators, divided into three clusters corresponding tothe three policy areas of governance, economic policy, and investment in people. Eligible countriesmust score above the median on half of the indicators in each area. One indicator -- control ofcorruption -- is a pass/fail measure: a country must score above the median on this single measureor be excluded from further consideration. The Administration proposed to create a new entity -- the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) -- to manage the initiative. The MCC would be supervised by a Board of Directors chairedby the Secretary of State. Several other key issues, including the number of participating countriesand monitoring mechanisms, have yet to be determined. Congress plays a key role in the policy initiative by considering authorization and funding legislation, and confirming the head of the proposed MCC. A number of issues have been addressedin the congressional debate, including country eligibility criteria, performance indicators used toselect participants, creation of the new MCC, and budget considerations. Congress approvedlegislation (Division D of P.L. 108-199 ) authorizing the new program and appropriating $994million for the first year. The measure creates a Corporation, as proposed, but alters the compositionand size of the Board of Directors. It further limits the extent to which lower-middle incomecountries in FY2006 and beyond can participate in the MCA so that more resources will be availablefor the poorest nations. The legislation creates a roughly 90-day period after the Corporation isestablished for consultation and public comment before selecting MCA participants for FY2004. It is expected that the Board will name the initial MCA eligible countries in May 2004.",govreport
"On January 4, 2011, President Obama signed P.L. 111-358 , the America COMPETES Reauthorization Act of 2010. The law responds to concerns about U.S. competitiveness by increasing funding for research in the physical sciences and engineering; authorizing certain federal science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education programs and policies; as well as addressing other related issues. COMPETES 2010 reauthorized selected provisions of the 2007 America COMPETES Act ( P.L. 110-69 ). The purpose of this report is to provide information on the President's FY2013 budget request—and the status of FY2013 congressional appropriations—for the agencies, programs, and activities authorized by COMPETES 2010. For a broader treatment of the America COMPETES Reauthorization Act of 2010, see CRS Report R41819, Reauthorization of the America COMPETES Act: Selected Policy Provisions, Funding, and Implementation Issues , by [author name scrubbed]. For information about prior year funding for both COMPETES acts, see CRS Report R42779, America COMPETES Acts: FY2008-FY2013 Funding Tables , by [author name scrubbed]. COMPETES 2010—like COMPETES 2007—was designed to ""invest in innovation through research and development, to improve the competitiveness of the United States, and for other purposes."" In total, COMPETES 2010 authorized approximately $45.5 billion in funding between FY2010 and FY2013 for federal research in the physical sciences and engineering, STEM education, and other related programs. Certain provisions of the law, including many funding authorizations, expired at the end of FY2013. Among other things, COMPETES 2010 increased funding authorizations for the National Science Foundation (NSF), the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) core laboratories and construction accounts, and the Department of Energy (DOE) Office of Science. It also authorized new technology transfer and commercialization activities at these agencies. In addition, COMPETES 2010 authorized inducement prizes at federal agencies, established a loan guarantee program for manufacturers, and established a Regional Innovation Program (RIP). In STEM education, COMPETES 2010 sought to provide greater coordination of federal STEM education programs, authorized support for academic programs that provide teacher certification concurrent with a bachelor's degree in a STEM field, and repealed certain unfunded STEM education programs authorized by COMPETES 2007. Like its predecessor, COMPETES 2007, the central policy contributions of COMPETES 2010 were the ""doubling path"" policy for the NSF, NIST core laboratories and construction accounts, and the DOE Office of Science, as well as the authorization of STEM education activities at various federal agencies. The President's FY2013 budget requested increased funding for the doubling path accounts (albeit at levels below those authorized) but included support for few COMPETES 2010 authorized STEM education programs. In this regard the President's FY2013 budget request was generally consistent with prior year Obama Administration requests and appropriations activity for both COMPETES acts. Of the new programs with defined funding authorizations in COMPETES 2010, only the Regional Innovation Program (RIP) at the Department of Commerce (DOC) was specifically included in the Administration's FY2013 budget request. The Administration's budget request did not seek funding for the NIST Green Jobs Act, Federal Loan Guarantees for Innovative Technologies in Manufacturing, or the STEM-Training Grant program. COMPETES 2010 also authorized new programs without providing a defined funding amount. One example of this type of authorization was the Green Chemistry Basic Research program at NSF. The FY2013 budget request included funding for a green chemistry program at NSF. The following sections discuss in greater detail the President's FY2013 budget request for selected programs and agencies authorized by COMPETES 2010. Where possible, this report has been updated to reflect FY2012 actual funding. Earlier versions of this report used FY2012 enacted, estimated, or current plan funding levels. This change provides a more accurate view of the difference between FY2012 funding levels and the President's FY2013 request. Table A-1 summarizes the FY2013 funding status of selected COMPETES 2010 provisions, including the President's FY2013 requests for these accounts. This section highlights the Administration's FY2013 budget request for selected research programs and accounts included in COMPETES 2010, including the doubling path accounts. At NIST, the President sought a total of $857.0 million in FY2013. This funding level was $106.2 million (14.1%) more than the FY2012 enacted level of $750.8 million and $182.7 million (17.6%) less than the authorized level of $1.040 billion. Within the NIST total, the President requested $648.0 million, or $81.0 million (14.3%) more than the FY2012 enacted level of $567.0 million and $28.7 million (4.2%) less than the authorized level of $676.7 million, for the core laboratories account. The President also sought $60.0 million, or $4.6 million (8.3%) more than the FY2012 enacted level of $55.4 million and $61.3 million (50.5%) less than the authorized amount of $121.3 million, for the construction account. The President's FY2013 request for NIST's Industrial Technology Services (ITS) account was $149.0 million, including $128.0 million for the Hollings Manufacturing Extension Partnership (MEP). The FY2013 Administration request for MEP was $400,000 less than the FY2012 enacted amount. The President did not seek funding for the Baldrige Performance Excellence Program in FY2013. The President did not specifically request FY2013 funds for activities authorized by the NIST Green Jobs Act. President Obama's FY2013 budget request for the NSF's Research and Related Activities (R&RA) account—which is the primary source of research funding at the foundation—was $5.983 billion. This amount was $225.0 million (3.9%) more than the FY2012 actual level of $5.758 billion and $654.5 million (9.9%) less than the COMPETES 2010 authorized amount of $6.638 billion. The President's FY2013 budget request for R&RA included specific funding for two COMPETES 2010 programs—the Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR) and Partnerships for Innovation (PFI). COMPETES 2010 reauthorized but did not specify funding levels for these programs. The President requested $158.2 million for EPSCoR in FY2013, $7.3 million (4.9%) more than the FY2012 actual funding level of $150.9 million. The FY2013 NSF budget request stated that the National Academy of Sciences was studying NSF's EPSCoR programs in accordance with Section 517 of COMPETES 2010. This report was published in 2013. The FY2013 request for PFI was $8.2 million, $200,000 more than the FY2012 estimate of $8.0 million. NSF FY2013 budget documents indicate that the foundation would dedicate the requested $200,000 increase to the Building Innovation Capacity track, which funds partnerships between academic researchers and small businesses. Section 509 of COMPETES 2010 directed NSF to establish a Green Chemistry Basic Research program. In response to these provisions, the FY2013 NSF budget request included funding for a new Sustainable Chemistry, Engineering and Materials (SusCHEM) program as part of NSF's Science, Engineering, and Education for Sustainability (SEES) portfolio. The President sought $76.7 million in FY2013 for SusCHEM and four other new related SEES programs. The FY2013 NSF budget request emphasized the ""OneNSF Framework,"" which sought to enable ""seamless operations across organizational and disciplinary boundaries."" Although the OneNSF Framework applied across all NSF directorates, most of the OneNSF Framework priorities were funded in the R&RA account. Other NSF-wide priorities included clean energy, advanced manufacturing, multidisciplinary research, and STEM education and workforce. The FY2013 NSF budget proposed $67.0 million in research program terminations, including reductions in Computer and Information Science and Engineering (CISE), Cyber-enabled Discovery and Innovation (CDI), Mathematics and Physical Sciences (MPS), Nanoscale Science & Engineering Centers (NSECs), and public outreach. The NSF FY2013 budget request described these programs as either duplicative or obsolete (either because the program had achieved its original goals or as a result of maturation in the field). In September 2012, NSF announced its intention to realign some of its research-related programs beginning in FY2013. The foundation moved two programs from the Office of the Director to the research directorates. The Office of Cyberinfrastructure became a division within the Directorate for Computer and Information Sciences, and the Office of Polar Programs became a division within the Directorate for Geosciences. The NSF also merged two other offices, the Office of International Science and Engineering and the Office of Integrative Activities, into the Office of International and Integrative Activities. It is not yet clear how or if these changes will affect foundation activities in these fields. NSF's FY2013 budget request to Congress did not reflect these consolidations. The foundation's FY2013 current plan does. The President's FY2013 budget request for the DOE Office of Science was $4.992 billion. This funding level was $57.0 million (1.2%) more than the FY2012 current plan funding level of $4.935 billion and $1.009 billion (16.8%) less than the authorized level in COMPETES 2010 ($6.001 billion). The President also sought $350.0 million for the ARPA-E account at DOE, which was $75.0 million (27.3%) more than the FY2012 current plan level of $275.0 million and $38.0 million (12.2%) more than the amount authorized in COMPETES 2010 ($312.0 million). Many federal policymakers have sought to increase federal funding for research in the physical sciences and engineering—and thereby, advocates assert, improve U.S. global economic competitiveness. Congress and the Bush and Obama Administrations have sought to double funding for the NSF, Department of Energy's Office of Science, and National Institute of Standards and Technology's core laboratory and construction accounts (collectively ""the targeted accounts"") from their FY2006 levels. To date, the main legislative acts authorizing the doubling path policy for the targeted accounts have been the COMPETES acts. Under COMPETES 2010, targeted account funding was authorized to increase at a compound annual growth rate of 6.3%. This growth rate was similar to the growth rate in actual appropriations for the targeted accounts during the COMPETES 2007 authorization period (6.4%). At the COMPETES 2010 authorized rate, it would have taken approximately 11 years to double funding for the targeted accounts. The President's FY2013 budget request re-asserted the Administration's ongoing support for the doubling path policy, but sought an overall increase of 4.1% for the targeted accounts. This increase was equal to the FY2012 enacted appropriations growth rate for the targeted accounts and, and if maintained, would have resulted in an 18-year doubling. The President's FY2013 STEM education request focused primarily on two groups: STEM graduates and STEM teachers. Specifically, the FY2013 budget request established a new ""government-wide goal to increase, over the next decade, the number of well-prepared college graduates with STEM degrees by one-third, or one million"" and continued the Administration's previous commitment to prepare 100,000 STEM teachers over the next decade (the ""100Kin10"" initiative). To achieve these goals, the President's FY2013 budget request sought program and funding changes to some existing COMPETES 2010 authorized programs and agencies. The President's FY2013 budget did not include specific requests for new STEM education programs authorized by COMPETES 2010, such as the STEM-Training Grant Program. The President's FY2013 budget request for the Department of Education (ED) proposed to reorganize the department (as it had previously proposed in the FY2011 and FY2012 requests). The proposed reorganization would have eliminated and consolidated certain programs, including COMPETES 2010 programs. For example, under the reorganization plan, both the Teachers for a Competitive Tomorrow (TCT) and Advanced Placement (AP) programs would have been eliminated and their program functions absorbed into the newly created Teacher and Leader Pathways (TLP) and College Pathways and Accelerated Learning (CPAL) programs, respectively. The status of both the TCT and AP programs, as authorized by the COMPETES acts, is unclear. Congress has not funded the TCT program since FY2010 and the President's FY2013 ED budget request did not specify funding for the program. Although ED operates an AP program, it typically does so under the authority of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965, as amended by No Child Left Behind (ESEA, P.L. 107-110 ), not under the authority of either COMPETES Act. The AP programs authorized by ESEA and COMPETES are substantively different, though they share some features. It is unclear if the AP program at ED complies with the AP program authorized by the COMPETES acts. The FY2013 ED request for CPAL, including the AP program authorized by ESEA, was $81.0 million. Of this amount, $24.1 million was dedicated to the advanced course test fee component of the AP program. The FY2012 enacted appropriation for the ESEA authorized AP program was $30.1 million. DOE does not typically request funding for COMPETES-acts-authorized STEM education programs. However, the department asserts that it operates programs that correspond with its responsibilities under the law. Among these is the DOE Office of Science's Science Graduate Fellowship (SCGF) program, which the department asserts is one of two fellowships that correspond with the Protecting America's Competitive Edge (PACE) graduate fellowship program. The President's FY2013 request for DOE included no funding for SCGF. This was consistent with FY2012 congressional appropriations actions. For example, House Committee on Appropriations FY2012 DOE appropriations report language directed the Office of Science to ""justify to the Committee why fellowships should be funded within the Office of Science when other agencies, in particular the National Science Foundation, are the primary federal entities for such purposes."" Current plan funding for SCGF in FY2012 was $5.0 million, which was to support a third year of funding for the FY2010 cohort of fellows. DOE also asserts that the Academies Creating Teacher Scientists (DOE ACTS) program corresponds with the Summer Institutes program and that the Office of Science Early Career Research Program corresponds with the Early Career Awards program. (COMPETES 2010 reauthorized both the Summer Institutes and Early Career Awards programs.) Based on the recommendation of a 2010 DOE Committee of Visitors report, DOE terminated DOE ACTS in FY2012. Accordingly, the President did not seek funding for DOE ACTS in FY2013. According to the DOE, each of the six Office of Science research programs supports Early Career Research Program awards out of their core research program offices. However, these research programs do not typically specify funding for Early Career Research program awards. DOE representatives state that, ""Office of Science support for Early Career Research awards is approximately $16.0 million per year."" CRS identified one specific request for the Early Career Research Program in the FY2013 Office of Science budget request. That specific request was in the Fusion Energy Sciences budget in the ""Other"" activity. In FY2012, enacted funding for the Fusion Energy Sciences ""Other"" activity was $11.9 million. These funds supported the Office of Science Early Career Research, Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU), and summer internships for undergraduates programs. The FY2013 request for the Fusion Energy Sciences ""Other"" activity was $9.2 million. This amount was $2.7 million, or 22.7%, less than the FY2012 enacted amount. In FY2012 the Senate Committee on Appropriations urged Office of Science to consider redirecting funds from terminated education programs to the Distinguished Scientist Program authorized by the COMPETES acts. The President's FY2013 request for Office of Science did not include funding for this program, which DOE had not initiated. The primary source of funding for STEM education activities at NSF is the Education and Human Resources (E&HR) account. The President sought $875.6 million for E&HR in FY2013. This amount was $45.1 million (5.4%) more than the FY2012 actual level of $830.5 million and $166.2 million (15.9%) less than the COMPETES 2010 authorized level of $1.042 billion. The FY2013 NSF budget request highlighted certain NSF-wide and E&HR-specific proposals for STEM education. NSF-wide efforts centered on the planned new Expeditions in Education (E 2 ) initiative, which sought to ""address a challenge in STEM learning or education using current or emerging areas of science."" E 2 was a $49.0 million co-funded initiative that was to be supported through contributions from various Research and Related Activities (R&RA) accounts ($28.5 million) and from E&HR ($20.5 million). The FY2013 NSF request also sought increased co-funding for the Graduate Research Fellowship (GRF) program. The FY2013 request for the GRF was $243.0 million, which was $45.1 million (22.8%) more than FY2012 actual. About half of FY2013 funding for the GRF was to come from R&RA, up from 7.4% in FY2009. NSF's FY2013 budget request stated that the increased funding would provide for 2,000 new fellows in FY2013 (8,900 total) at a cost of education (COE) level of $12,000 per fellow. NSF's FY2013 budget request asserted that the FY2013 COE level was consistent with COMPETES 2010. Other major E&HR initiatives in FY2013 included increased coordination with the Department of Education (ED) on the Mathematics and Science Partnership (MSP) program, on STEM education research, and on a proposed K-16 mathematics education program. E&HR and ED proposed a jointly funded, new $60.0 million K-16 mathematics program. E&HR contributions to the program were to come from the Discovery Research K-12 (DR-K12) program and from the Transforming Undergraduate Education in STEM (TUES) program. Finally, the FY2013 request for E&HR sought to ""reframe"" E&HR programs and activities such that each division's programs and activities would align with one of three new categories of activity (e.g., core research and development investments, leadership investments, and expedition investments). The Administration sought $20.0 million in new funding ($5.0 million for each E&HR division) for a ""Core Launch Fund"" to support the reframing. The FY2013 NSF budget request included funding for existing STEM education programs authorized under COMPETES 2010, but for which the act does not specify funding levels. These include the Integrative Graduate Education and Research Traineeship (IGERT), the Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship (Noyce) program, Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU), and the STEM Talent Expansion Program (STEP), among others. The Administration's FY2013 requests for these programs were $51.7 million for IGERT ($8.1 million below the FY2012 estimate), $54.9 million for Noyce (same as FY2012 actual), $68.4 million for REU ($11.2 million below FY2012 actual), and $17.3 million for STEP ($7.0 million below FY2012 actual). Both America COMPETES acts authorized an NSF program to support Hispanic-serving institutions (HSIs). Section 7033 of COMPETES 2007 directed NSF to establish a program for HSIs. Section 512 of COMPETES 2010 directed the NSF to maintain its HSI program—and all other minority-serving institution (MSI) programs, such as the Historically Black Colleges and Universities Undergraduate Program (HBCU-UP)—as separate programs. Although NSF's FY2013 budget request maintained existing MSI programs separately, NSF has not established an HSI-specific program. The FY2013 request listed ""research to examine the particular STEM student and institutional capacity needs in Hispanic-serving institutions"" as one of the emphases of the Division of Human Research Development within E&HR, but did not otherwise specifically mention HSIs. The President's FY2013 budget requested funding for other COMPETES 2010 provisions as well. These include $25.0 million for the new RIP program at the DOC's Economic Development Administration (EDA). Of this amount, the President sought $7.0 million for the Science Park Infrastructure Loan Guarantee program, which COMPETES 2010 authorized as a separate component of the RIP program. The Administration's FY2013 budget request did not include specific funding for the new Federal Loan Guarantees for Innovative Technologies in Manufacturing program at the DOC or for the activities authorized by the NIST Green Jobs Act of 2010, both of which were authorized by COMPETES 2010. FY2012 funding for the DOC included $5.0 million each for the science park and manufacturing loan guarantee programs and encouraged EDA to support RIP activities through the Economic Adjustment Assistance account. Funding for COMPETES 2010 programs and agencies is typically included in three appropriations acts: Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies (CJS), for NSF, NIST, and other Department of Commerce programs; Energy and Water Development (Energy-Water), for DOE programs; and Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, and Related Agencies (Labor-HHS-Education), for ED programs. As appropriations measures often include a variety of provisions and programs, this section focuses on funding provisions that relate most closely to policies, programs, agencies, and activities specifically authorized by COMPETES 2010. Table A-1 summarizes the FY2013 funding status of these selected provisions, including House-passed, Senate Committee on Appropriations recommended, and final (post-rescission, post-sequestration) FY2013 appropriations to these accounts. Congressional appropriations for COMPETES 2010-related agencies in FY2013 were provided in two sequential acts. On September 28, 2013, the President signed P.L. 112-175 (Continuing Appropriations Resolution, 2013). Among other things, this law provided continuing appropriations to federal agencies at FY2012 levels with an across-the-board increase of 0.612% through March 27, 2013. On March 26, 2013, the President signed P.L. 113-6 (FY2013 Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, H.R. 933 ), which provided regular appropriations for some federal agencies and continuing appropriations for others. P.L. 113-6 also included certain rescissions that applied to COMPETES 2010 accounts. In lieu of a conference report on H.R. 933 , the Chairwoman of the Senate Committee on Appropriations published an explanatory statement in the March 11, 2013, Congressional Record . Among other things, the explanatory statement sought to resolve conflicts between certain House and Senate FY2013 appropriations committee report recommendations. Of the COMPETES 2010-related agencies, those that received funding through CJS provisions (Division B) were provided with regular appropriations while those that received funding through Energy-Water and Labor-HHS-Education (both in Division F) were provided with continuing appropriations. This distinction is important for congressional policymakers who may assess the status of proposed changes to agency activities included in the President's FY2013 budget request. Agencies that received regular appropriations would typically be allowed to make Administration-requested changes within the constraints of existing federal law and direction from congressional appropriators. On the other hand, agencies that received continuing appropriations would not typically have the authority to make requested changes. The topic of across-the-board federal budget cuts (known as ""sequestration"") required under the Budget Control Act of 2011 ( P.L. 112-25 ) dominated much of the FY2013 congressional budget and appropriations debate. COMPETES 2010-related accounts were generally subject to sequestration. Where possible, the following sections include FY2013 funding levels that include the effects of sequestration, as well as any applicable rescissions in P.L. 113-6 . The House passed H.R. 5326 (Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2013) by a vote of 247-163 on May 10, 2012. The act would have provided FY2013 appropriations for the Department of Commerce (including NIST), NSF, and other CJS agencies. H.R. 5326 was accompanied by H.Rept. 112-463 when it was reported from the House Committee on Appropriations. The Senate Committee on Appropriations reported a bill to provide FY2013 CJS appropriations on April 19, 2012 ( S. 2323 ). The full Senate did not consider that measure. S.Rept. 112-158 accompanied S. 2323 when it was reported from committee. This section compares FY2013 post-rescission, post-sequestration CJS funding levels (where available) for selected COMPETES 2010 accounts with enacted, current, or actual FY2012 funding levels (as noted), and FY2013 COMPETES 2010 authorized funding levels. This section also compares FY2013 House-passed funding levels for selected COMPETES 2010 accounts with Senate Committee on Appropriations recommendations and Administration budget requests. (See Table A-1 for details.) Selected COMPETES 2010-related policy provisions from H.Rept. 112-463 , S.Rept. 112-158 , and the March 11, 2013, explanatory statement are also noted herein. The following sections describe the FY2013 funding status for COMPETES-related provisions at the DOC. These include ""top line,"" or full agency funding, for NIST programs and accounts, as well as provisions for various economic development programs. Top line Allocations . FY2013 post-rescission, post-sequestration funding for NIST was $769.4 million. This amount was $18.6 million (2.5%) more than the FY2012 enacted funding level of $750.8 million and was $270.3 million (26.0%) less than the COMPETES 2010 authorized funding level of $1.040 billion. H.R. 5326 , as passed by the House, would have provided a total of $830.6 million to NIST in FY2013. This amount was $4.6 million (0.6%) more than the Senate Committee on Appropriations recommendation of $826.0 million and $26.4 million (3.1%) less than the Administration's request for $857.0 million. STRS (core laboratories) . FY2013 post-rescission, post-sequestration funding for STRS was $579.8 million. This amount was $12.8 million (2.3%) more than the FY2012 enacted funding level of $567.0 million and was $96.9 million (14.3%) less than the COMPETES 2010 authorized funding level of $676.7 million. H.R. 5326 , as passed by the House, would have provided $621.2 million to STRS in FY2013. This amount was $1.8 million (0.3%) less than the Senate Committee on Appropriations recommendation of $623.0 million and $26.8 million (4.1%) less than the Administration's request for $648.0 million. The March 11, 2013, explanatory statement included language allowing NIST to locally transport Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowship (SURF) participants. CRF (construction) . FY2013 post-rescission, post-sequestration funding for CRF was $56.0 million. This amount was $4.6 million (8.3%) more than the FY2012 enacted funding level of $55.4 million and was $61.3 million (50.5%) less than the COMPETES 2010 authorized funding level of $121.3 million. H.R. 5326 (as passed by the House), S. 2323 (as recommended by the Senate Committee on Appropriations), and the March 11, 2013, explanatory statement would have provided $60.0 million to CRF in FY2013. This amount was equal to the Administration's request. MEP . FY2013 post-rescission, post-sequestration funding for the MEP program was $119.4 million. This amount was $9.0 million (7.0%) less than the FY2012 enacted funding level of $128.4 million and $45.7 million (27.7%) less than the authorized funding level of $165.1 billion. H.R. 5326 would have provided $128.4 million to the MEP in FY2013. This amount was about the same as the Senate Committee on Appropriations recommendation of $128.5 million and $400,000 more than the Administration's request for $128.0 million. Regional Innovation Program (RIP) and Innovative Technologies in Manufacturing. COMPETES 2010 authorized two regional economic development programs at the EDA: RIP, which included funding for loan guarantees for science parks, and the Federal Loan Guarantees for Innovative Technologies in Manufacturing program. P.L. 113-6 provided $5.0 million each (pre-rescission, pre-sequestration) for the loan guarantee programs. These amounts were equal to FY2012 enacted funding levels and were, respectively, $15.0 million and $2.0 million less than COMPETES 2010 authorized funding levels of $20.0 million for manufacturing loan guarantees and $7.0 million for science park loan guarantees. The DOC's FY2014 budget request states that the department anticipates initial execution of loan guarantees (from both programs) in FY2015. H.R. 5326 would have authorized unspecified funding for the RIP and would have provided up to $5.0 million for the manufacturing loan guarantee program in FY2013. S. 2323 and S.Rept. 112-158 would have provided $25.0 million for RIP, and up to $7.0 million for loan guarantees for science parks, but did not specify funding for the manufacturing loan guarantee program. Senate provisions were consistent with the President's FY2013 request. Provisions in the House committee report directed EDA to provide details of its efforts to implement the manufacturing loan guarantee program with its FY2014 budget request. Provisions in the Senate committee report directed EDA to continue providing grants and technical assistance to entities supporting clean energy technology commercialization; to consider new competitions in industries not previously targeted; and to consider geographic equity when making award decisions. Top Line Allocations. FY2013 post-rescission, post-sequestration funding for NSF was $6.884 billion. This amount was $220.6 million (3.1%) less than the FY2012 actual funding level of $7.105 billion and $1.416 billion (17.1%) less than the COMPETES 2010 authorized funding level of $8.300 billion. FY2013 funding levels in H.R. 5326 and S. 2323 were identical for five of NSF's six major accounts. A $59.4 million difference in funding for the main research account (Research and Related Activities, or R&RA) led to an equivalent difference between the two top lines, which were $7.333 billion (House) and $7.273 billion (Senate Committee on Appropriations). Other than this difference, the House and the Senate Committee on Appropriations agreed on major funding levels for the NSF in FY2013. At the top line, both the full House and Senate committee-proposed funding levels for NSF were between $40.6 and $100.0 million less than the President's request for $7.373 billion. The Senate report directed NSF to report on its progress implementing and responding to various Office of the Inspector General reports and recommendations. An amendment ( H.Amdt. 1088 ) adopted during House floor debate on H.R. 5326 would have eliminated funding for NSF's Climate Change Education program. A second amendment to H.R. 5326 that was adopted during House floor debate ( H.Amdt. 1094 ) would have eliminated funding for political science research at NSF. Research Funding. FY2013 post-rescission, post-sequestration funding for R&RA was $5.544 billion. This amount was $214.6 million (3.7%) less than the FY2012 actual funding level of $5.758 billion and was $1.094 billion (16.5%) less than the COMPETES 2010 authorized funding level of $6.638 billion. H.R. 5326 would have provided $5.943 billion for R&RA in FY2013. This amount was $59.4 million (1.0%) more than the Senate Committee on Appropriations recommendation of $5.883 million and $40.6 million (0.7%) less than the President's FY2013 request for $5.983 billion. Research provisions in the House committee report directed NSF to give priority to research in the following fields: cybersecurity; advanced manufacturing; materials research; and research in the natural and physical sciences, mathematics, and engineering. Other provisions from the House committee report directed I-Corps participants to commit to the domestic production of goods or services commercialized with NSF assistance, encouraged the foundation to establish neuroscience as a cross-cutting budget theme, required NSF to report on plans to recompete certain major facilities awards, and required NSF to report on interdisciplinary activities at NSF-funded research facilities. Research provisions in the Senate committee report directed NSF to reduce funding for new OneNSF activities and to focus on core programs and infrastructure. Other research provisions in the Senate committee report provided the full request—$244.6 million ($161.9 of which was reserved for infrastructure)—for astronomical sciences; provided funding for the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope; and encouraged NSF to allocate adequate funding for domestic radio astronomy facilities while the Atacama Large Millimeter Array transitions to full operation. The Senate committee report also provided funding for cybersecurity security research ($161.0 million) and the Academic Research Fleet ($927.8 million), and supported full funding for scientific facilities and instrumentation. EPSCoR, which was reauthorized by COMPETES 2010, would have received $158.0 million under the Senate committee proposal. (This amount is slightly less than the FY2013 request for $158.2 million and $7.1 million more than the FY2012 actual funding level of $150.9 million.) Provisions in the March 11, 2013, explanatory statement incorporated NSF's proposed R&RA terminations; adopted by reference House report language relating to advanced manufacturing; adopted by reference Senate report language on cybersecurity research; and adopted by reference House report language regarding I-Corps, with the stipulation that if NSF determines that there are practical considerations that prevent implementation, then the foundation was to report those concerns to the appropriations committees immediately. Other R&RA provisions in the explanatory statement rejected Senate report limitations on OneNSF initiatives, but stated that future growth should not come at the expense of core functions and encouraged NSF to refine the balance between core functions and OneNSF initiatives in its FY2014 and future budget requests. The explanatory statement provided $247.6 million (pre-rescission, pre-sequestration) for astronomical sciences, including $164.9 million for infrastructure, and provided $158.2 million (pre-sequester, pre-rescission) for EPSCoR. STEM Education. FY2013 post-rescission, post-sequestration funding for NSF's main education account, Education and Human Resources (E&HR), was $833.3 million. This amount was $2.8 million (0.3%) more than the FY2012 actual funding level of $830.5 million and was $208.5 million (20.0%) less than the COMPETES 2010 authorized funding level of $1.041 billion. The full House and the Senate Committee on Appropriations agreed on E&HR funding levels in FY2013. Both legislative bodies proposed $875.6 million for E&HR in FY2013. This amount was equal to the President's budget request. STEM education provisions in the House committee report incorporated NSF's proposed program reductions; directed the foundation to continue work on a tracking and evaluation system to assess implementation of the National Research Council (NRC) report on best practices in STEM education; and accepted proposed changes to the Informal Science Education (ISE) program, but encouraged NSF to work with stakeholders as it transitions ISE toward activities intended to increase focus on innovative learning and engagement strategies. The House committee report also encouraged NSF to use existing resources to promote collaboration between research institutions and STEM-focused K-12 schools. The Senate committee report encouraged NSF to continue support for undergraduate science and engineering education; rejected the Administration's proposed cuts to the ISE program; urged NSF to ensure that GRF applications are reviewed on their merit, and not rejected for reasons other than the quality of the proposal; and directed NSF to fund the Research in Disabilities Education and Research on Gender in Science and Engineering programs at FY2012 levels (and to maintain these two programs as separate programs). S.Rept. 112-158 also provided: the full requests for the Advanced Technological Education ($64.0 million) and Noyce ($54.9 million) programs, as well as $45.0 million ($20.0 million more than the request) for the Federal Cyber Service: Scholarships for Service program. Provisions in the March 11, 2013, explanatory statement incorporated most of NSF's proposed reductions, with the exception of the reductions in the ISE (now renamed Advancing Informal Science Learning or AISL). The explanatory statement directed NSF to fund AISL as described in the Senate report; provided $69.0 million for ATE; adopted by reference House report language on tracking implementation of the recommendations contained in the NRC report on best practices in STEM education; and adopted by reference Senate report language on the Federal Cyber Service: Scholarships for Service program. Broadening Participation. NSF had not published, as of the date of this report, post-rescission, post-sequestration FY2013 funding levels for all its various broadening participation programs. Total FY2012 actual funding for programs that NSF identifies as broadening participation programs was $761.1 million. Although FY2013 funding information for all NSF broadening participation programs was not yet available as of the date of this report, the NSF supplied CRS with current plan funding levels for some COMPETES 2010-related broadening participation programs. In particular, FY2013 current plan funding for the Historically Black Colleges and Universities Undergraduate Program (HBCU-UP) was $30.3 million, compared to $31.9 million in FY2012 actual. The Tribal Colleges and Universities Program (TCUP) received $12.3 million, compared to $13.4 million in FY2012 actual. The Louis Stokes Alliances for Minority Participation (Stokes) program received $42.1 million, compared to $45.5 million in FY2012 actual; and the Centers for Research Excellence in Science and Technology (CREST) program received $23.0 million, compared to $24.2 million in FY2012 actual. The House committee report provided the FY2013 request for HBCU-UP ($31.9 million), Stokes ($45.6 million), and T-CUP ($13.3 million). The Senate committee report provided $33.0 million for HBCU-UP, $47.8 million for Stokes, and $13.4 million for TCUP. Additionally, the Senate committee report provided $25.0 million for the Centers for Research Excellence in Science and Technology (CREST) program. The March 11, 2013, explanatory statement incorporated Senate report funding levels for these programs. Provisions in the House committee report also directed NSF to report on how the needs of Hispanic Serving Institutions (HSIs) would be addressed in FY2013 and on any plans to establish an HSI-focused program in FY2014. Provisions in the Senate committee report encouraged NSF to prioritize proposals that have ""demonstrated maturity, including previous partnerships with other federal agencies."" The House passed H.R. 5325 (Energy and Water Development Appropriations Bill, 2013) by a vote of 255-165 on June 6, 2012. Among other things, the act provided FY2013 appropriations for the Department of Energy's Office of Science and the Advanced Research Projects Agency–Energy (ARPA-E). COMPETES 2010 provided authorizations for both the Office of Science and ARPA-E. The Senate Committee on Appropriations reported an FY2013 Energy and Water Development appropriations bill on April 26, 2012 ( S.Rept. 112-164 , S. 2465 ). The full Senate did not consider that measure. As previously noted, P.L. 112-175 provided continuing appropriations to Energy-Water agencies through March 26, 2013. P.L. 113-6 provided continuing appropriations to Energy-Water agencies from March 27, 2013, through the end of the fiscal year. This section compares FY2013 post-rescission, post-sequestration Energy-Water funding levels (where available) for selected COMPETES 2010 accounts with enacted, current, or actual FY2012 funding levels (as noted), and FY2013 COMPETES 2010 authorized funding levels. This section also compares House-passed FY2013 funding levels for selected COMPETES 2010 accounts with Senate Committee on Appropriations FY2013 recommendations and FY2013 Administration budget requests. (See Table A-1 for details.) Selected COMPETES 2010-related policy provisions in H.Rept. 112-463 and S.Rept. 112-158 are also noted herein. Office of Science . FY2013 post-rescission, post-sequestration funding for the Office of Science was $4.621 billion. This amount was $313.9 million (6.4%) less than FY2012 current funding level of $4.935 billion and $1.380 billion (23.0%) less than the COMPETES 2010 authorized funding level of $6.001 billion. H.R. 5325 would have provided $4.801 billion for the Office of Science in FY2013. This amount was $107.6 million (2.2%) less than the Senate Committee on Appropriations' recommendation of $4.909 billion and $190.6 million (3.8%) less than the President's FY2013 request for $4.992 billion. Office of Science provisions in the House committee report included the expectation that the office would continue to support minority serving institutions. Office of Science provisions in the Senate committee report expressed continued support for research priorities in new materials, biofuels, and computing. However, the Senate committee report also expressed concerns about how the office manages lower priority research activities. In particular, the Senate committee report noted that the office has not provided sufficient strategic guidance on how lower priority research areas may or should adjust their scope of work in response to decreasing budgets. Both House and Senate committee reports also contained specific provisions for Office of Science research programs. STEM Education. Although not the only source of funding for STEM education at the Department of Energy, the Office of Science's Workforce Development for Teachers and Scientists (WDTS) account provides funding for internships, fellowships, and the National Science Bowl (among other activities). FY2013 post-rescission, post-sequestration funding for WDTS was $17.5 million. This amount was $1.0 million (5.5%) less than the FY2012 current funding level of $18.5 million. The House committee report would have provided $14.5 million for the WDTS account in FY2013. This amount was the same as both the Senate committee recommendation and the FY2013 request. H.Rept. 112-462 provided no funds for the Office of Science Graduate Fellowship (SCGF). This was consistent with the Office of Science FY2013 budget request. The Senate committee report commended the Office of Science for its efforts to evaluate its science workforce development programs. The House committee report included educational activities on its list of ""major committee concerns"" about DOE (in general, not just in the Office of Science account). Other major committee concerns with a potential COMPETES Act nexus included competitiveness and intellectual property. (See section titled ""Other DOE-wide Issues and Competitiveness."") H.Rept. 112-462 prohibited DOE from funding fellowship and scholarship programs in FY2013 unless (1) those programs were specifically requested in FY2013 DOE budget justification and (2) the program was not otherwise excluded from receiving funding. The House committee report also directed DOE to provide the committee with a comprehensive listing of all FY2012 funded educational activities. ARPA-E. FY2013 post-rescission, post-sequestration funding for ARPA-E was $250.6 million. This amount was $24.4 million (8.9%) less than FY2012 current funding level of $275.0 million and was $61.4 million (19.7%) less than the COMPETES 2010 authorized funding level of $312.0 million. H.R. 5325 would have provided $200.0 million for ARPA-E in FY2013. This amount was $112.0 million (35.9%) less than the Senate Committee on Appropriations' recommendation of $312.0 million and $150.0 million (42.9%) less than the President's FY2013 request for $350.0 million. COMPETES 2010 authorized $312.0 million for ARPA-E in FY2013. ARPA-E provisions in the House committee report expressed support for the program's increased focus on transportation technologies. An amendment added during House floor debate would have prohibited ARPA-E awardees from using federal funds to raise private capital or advertise. ARPA-E provisions in S.Rept. 112-164 encouraged DOE ""to continue tracking projects to demonstrate how federal investments have developed more energy efficient technologies and potentially new industries."" Other DOE-wide Issues and Competitiveness. H.Rept. 112-462 expressed a number of general concerns about the DOE, including concerns that the agency has failed to produce committee-requested reports on certain Office of Science activities (e.g., Energy Innovation Hubs, exascale computing, future year funding levels for Office of Science accounts) in a timely manner. The House committee report also encouraged DOE to consider aspects of the ARPA-E project and program management model for application elsewhere in the department and raised general competitiveness concerns about the possibility that foreign manufacturers may be capitalizing on ideas developed in DOE labs. In response to competitiveness concerns, H.Rept. 112-462 directed DOE to report on existing authorities to control intellectual property and help retain domestic manufacturing and to make recommendations for improving domestic intellectual property transfer and retention. S.Rept. 112-164 also expressed a number of general concerns about DOE. For example, the Senate committee report raised concerns about contractor support at the Office of Science (and elsewhere in the department), noting that the cost of contractor support functions at the office increased by 10% between FY2007 and FY2009. The Senate committee report also directed DOE to maintain existing small business contracting practices at the national laboratories—which the committee report stated the department had considered changing—and directed DOE to consult with Congress, including the Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, before making any changes. Neither chamber considered a regular Labor-HHS-Education appropriations measure in FY2013. However, the Senate Committee on Appropriations reported S. 3295 (Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2013) on June 14, 2012. (See S.Rept. 112-176 .) The Senate committee report did not specify funding amounts for COMPETES acts-related Department of Education (ED) programs. As previously noted, P.L. 112-175 provided continuing appropriations to Labor-HHS-Education agencies through March 26, 2013. P.L. 113-6 provided continuing appropriations to Labor-HHS-Education agencies from March 27, 2013, through the end of the fiscal year. Neither act made specific provisions for COMPETES 2010 authorizations at ED. Under COMPETES 2010, targeted account funding was set to increase at a compound annual growth rate of 6.3%, close to the 6.4% growth rate in actual appropriations for the targeted accounts during the COMPETES 2007 authorization period (FY2008 to FY2010). At the 6.3% COMPETES 2010 authorized rate, it would have taken approximately 11 years to double funding for the targeted accounts. However, growth in actual appropriations to the targeted accounts during the COMPETES 2010 authorization period—FY2011 to FY2013—slowed in comparison to growth in actual appropriations during the COMPETES 2007 authorization period. As a result, FY2013 post-rescission, post-sequestration appropriations for the targeted accounts represent a growth rate of about 3.0% since the FY2006 baseline. Further, FY2013 funding levels for the targeted accounts—separately and combined—were generally below FY2010 levels. Only the NIST core laboratory account was higher in FY2013 than in FY2010. The COMPETES acts were designed to improve the competitive position of the United States by fostering scientific and technological innovation. The primary policy devices that the acts employed—to this end—were increases in authorized funding for physical sciences and engineering research (e.g., the doubling path policy) and STEM education program authorizations. The specific debate about FY2013 funding for COMPETES 2010 provisions occurred within the broader conversation about these policy choices. This section briefly summarizes this policy context. Few analysts dispute the contention that the path to global competitiveness in the 21 st century runs through the twin pillars of scientific and technological advancement. The policy question, then, is what should the federal government do (if anything) to encourage scientific and technological innovation and (thereby) national competitiveness? A broad coalition of business, academic, and government leaders has concluded that at least part of the answer to this question is that the federal government should encourage innovation by increasing support for physical sciences and engineering research and by increasing the number of U.S. students graduating with STEM degrees and skills. Supporters of this general consensus assert that a combination of external pressures and internal weaknesses threatens the United States' innovation advantage. For example, supporters note that changes in the industrial bases and educational attainment rates of rapidly developing countries like China and India mean that these countries are able to compete for a growing percentage of the world's high-value jobs and industry. Further, these advocates assert that signs of potential weakness in areas that have long been U.S. strengths—such as the U.S. STEM workforce and leading-edge research—appear to accompany these global changes. In particular, COMPETES acts proponents raise concerns about funding for research in the physical sciences and engineering and the U.S. supply of scientists, engineers, and technicians. Although support for the innovation policy approach embodied in the COMPETES acts is widespread, it is not uniform. Opposition has tended to fall into three broad categories: (1) questions about fundamental assumptions, (2) preferences for alternative policies or approaches, and (3) cost. For example, some analysts dispute fundamental assumptions behind policies designed to increase the supply of STEM workers, arguing that there is no evidence of broad shortages of STEM workers and that the bigger challenge is on the demand side. Another fundamental assumption that some analysts have called into question is whether increased investment in publically funded research will increase U.S. competiveness given that such research is typically publically available. Other analysts prefer other policy tools—such as regulatory changes and tax policy—arguing that direct federal investment in research in the physical sciences and engineering and in STEM education can distort markets. Opponents have also raised concerns about cost, arguing that authorized funding increases are too expensive in light of the federal fiscal condition, deficit, and debt. FY2013 was the third and final year for most of COMPETES 2010's major funding authorizations. Although the full House, Senate Committee on Appropriations, and the President all initially sought increases over FY2012 levels for many (not all) key COMPETES 2010 accounts in FY2013; the combined effects of sequestration, as well as rescissions and funding levels in the final FY2013 appropriations act ( P.L. 113-6 ) decreased funding levels for many (not all) of these accounts below FY2010 actual levels. Further, although there has always been a gap between COMPETES act authorizations (total, defined) and appropriations (total, defined), that gap widened in FY2013 and was larger than in all previous authorized years. It remains to be seen whether and how the FY2013 funding status of COMPETES accounts will factor in future congressional conversations about reauthorization of COMPETES 2010 and future appropriations for these accounts.","Signed on January 4, 2011, the America COMPETES Reauthorization Act of 2010 (COMPETES 2010, P.L. 111-358) sought to improve U.S. competitiveness and innovation by authorizing, among other things, increased federal support for research in the physical sciences and engineering, as well as science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education. Certain provisions of the law, including major funding authorizations, expired in FY2013. This report describes the President's FY2013 budget request for selected COMPETES 2010 provisions and tracks the status of FY2013 funding for these appropriations accounts. The President's FY2013 budget requested an increase of 4.1% for the ""doubling path"" accounts at the National Science Foundation (NSF), Department of Energy's Office of Science, and National Institute of Standards and Technology's (NIST's) core laboratory and construction. This growth rate was less than the COMPETES 2010 authorized rate of 6.3% and equal to the FY2012 enacted appropriations rate. At the end of the COMPETES 2010 authorization period in FY2013, the growth rate in the targeted accounts was 3.0% (from the FY2006 baseline). Funding levels for the targeted accounts—individually and combined—were generally below FY2010 levels. The sole exception was the NIST core laboratory account, which was higher in FY2013 than in FY2010. For FY2013, Congress provided both regular and continuing appropriations to COMPETES 2010 agencies. NSF and NIST received regular appropriations, while the Office of Science and Department of Education received continuing funding. The combined effects of sequestration and rescissions in P.L. 113-6 (FY2013 Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act) resulted in year-over-year reductions for the Office of Science, the Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy (ARPA-E), and most NSF accounts. FY2013 funding for most NIST accounts increased slightly over FY2012 enacted levels. All of the selected COMPETES 2010 accounts were funded below authorized levels. Table A-1 contains information about the FY2013 funding status of selected provisions from COMPETES 2010. Both the House and the Senate Committee on Appropriations approved FY2013 appropriations bills for the NSF, NIST, and Office of Science before Congress enacted P.L. 113-6. As initially proposed, differences between House and Senate top line funding levels for NSF and NIST were less than 1%, while the difference in funding for the Office of Science was 2.2%. Proposed FY2013 funding for ARPA-E revealed larger differences between the chambers. The House would have provided $200 million while the Senate Committee on Appropriations sought the authorized amount ($312.0 million). FY2013 funding for COMPETES 2010's STEM education provisions were largely consistent with previous appropriations cycles, which have not typically included specific funding levels for these activities. A notable exception to this rule is the main education account at NSF. As initially requested, passed, and recommended, the President's, House, and Senate Committee on Appropriations each provided $875.6 million for this account in FY2013. Post-rescission, post-sequestration FY2013 funding for this account was $833.3 million.",govreport
"The Lacey Act was enacted in 1900 to address game poaching and wildlife laundering, among other things. The Lacey Act regulates the trade of wildlife and plants and creates penalties for a broad spectrum of violations. Violations addressed by the Lacey Act involve domestic and international illegal trade of plants and wildlife. Before the enactment of amendments in 2008, the Lacey Act addressed these issues by making it unlawful for any person to: ""import, export, transport, sell, receive, acquire, or purchase any fish or wildlife or plant taken, possessed, transported, or sold in violation of any law, treaty, or regulation of the United States or in violation of any Indian tribal law""; or to ""import, export, transport, sell, receive, acquire, or purchase in interstate or foreign commerce any fish or wildlife taken, possessed, transported, or sold in violation of any law or regulation of any state, or in violation of any foreign law;"" and any plant taken, possessed, transported, or sold in violation of any state law or regulation. In 2008, the Lacey Act was amended to include nonindigenous plants and violations of foreign laws pertaining to certain conservation actions and other activities involving plants and plant products. Based in part on these amendments, the Lacey Act now makes it unlawful for any person to import, export, transport, sell, receive, acquire, or purchase in interstate or foreign commerce any plant taken, possessed, transported, or sold in violation of any law or regulation of any state, or any foreign law, that protects plants or that regulates taking or exporting plants and plant products in certain situations. This includes plants taken, possessed, transported, or sold without the payment of appropriate royalties, taxes, or stumpage fees; and plants exported in violation of state or foreign law. Further, in reference to plants, it is unlawful to import, export, transport, sell, receive, acquire, or purchase any plant or plant product taken, possessed, transported, or sold in violation of any law, treaty, or regulation of the United States or in violation of any Indian tribal law. In addition, the Lacey Act makes it unlawful to falsify or submit falsified documents related to any plant or plant product covered by the act, and to import certain plants and plant products without an import declaration. The provisions related to fish, wildlife, and plants in reference to laws, treaties, and regulations of the United States and any Indian tribal law were unchanged (although the definition of plants was expanded to include nonindigenous plants). The 2008 amendments to the Lacey Act (2008 amendments) also expand the definition of a plant to include any plants (including foreign plants), whereas before it referred only to plants indigenous to any state or associated commonwealths, territories, or possessions of the United States. A plant is specifically defined as ""any wild member of the plant kingdom, including roots, seeds, parts, or products thereof, and including trees from either natural or planted forest stands."" There are certain exclusions to this definition of plants, including common cultivars (except trees), common food crops, scientific specimens of plant genetic material to be used for laboratory or field research, and any plant that is to remain planted or be planted or replanted. The 2008 amendments also require importers of all covered plants and plant products to submit an import declaration to U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) at the time of importation. The law requires that the declaration contain certain information, such as identification of the species and genus of plants or plants used in a product, and country of origin of plants, among other things. The declaration appears to apply to all plants and plant products, including those plants harvested or plant products made before the enactment of 2008 amendments. The primary aims of the 2008 amendments were to reduce illegal logging and to increase the value of U.S. wood exports. International illegal logging is a pervasive problem affecting several countries that produce, export, and import wood and wood products. Estimates of the extent of illegal logging vary and may not be completely accurate due to the clandestine nature of the activity. Some have estimated that 15% to 30% of the volume of all forestry is attributable to illegal logging. In tropical countries, some estimate that between 50% and 90% of all logging is illegal. Illegal logging is a concern to many because of its economic implications as well as its environmental, social, and political impacts. The economic value of global illegal logging is estimated to be between $50 billion and $100 billion of the global wood trade. An analysis by the World Bank estimates that illegal logging costs governments approximately $5 billion annually in lost royalties and an additional $10 billion in lost revenue. Some are concerned that high U.S. demand for tropical timber from countries in Latin America and Southeast Asia may exacerbate illegal logging. The United States is the world's largest wood products consumer and one of the top importers of tropical hardwoods. For example, the United States is the largest importer of Peruvian mahogany, which some estimate to be 80% illegally logged. Global illegal logging activities can devalue U.S. exports of timber. Illegally logged wood generally costs less to bring to market than legally logged wood due to nonpayment of fees or taxes, and avoidance of costs related to laws that govern harvesting. This lowers the market price of wood, potentially harming timber operations that operate legally. According to a 2004 report issued by the American Forest and Paper Association, it is estimated that illegal logging of roundwood for wood products depresses world wood prices on average by 7%-16% annually. This affects U.S. producers of wood and their exports. If there were no illegally logged wood in the global market, it has been projected that the value of U.S. exports of roundwood, sawnwood, and panels could increase by an average of approximately $460 million each year. Further, if increases in value for domestic wood production if illegal logging is halted are taken into account, then the increase in value of wood products in the United States each year could be approximately $1.0 billion, according to the study. Other countries and entities have adopted measures similar to the Lacey Act. The European Union (EU), for example, has a regulation that prohibits the placement of illegally harvested timber and timber products on the EU market and requires entities to establish due diligence schemes. Australia passed a similar law that prohibits the import of wood or wood products that were illegally logged or contain illegally logged timber. The requirements established in the Lacey Act are administered by the Departments of the Interior, Commerce, and Agriculture through their respective agencies. These include the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS), National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), and Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS). This report summarizes the implementation of the 2008 amendments to the Lacey Act and discusses policy issues related to the amendments. A raid on Gibson Guitar Corporation (see box below) brought to light several existing policy and legal issues related to the 2008 amendments to the Lacey Act. In broad terms, some question why U.S. importers should be held responsible for violations of foreign law potentially committed by foreign entities (i.e., not U.S. importers). They claim that it is difficult to monitor the harvesting and processing of plants and plant products in foreign countries to make sure that no foreign laws are being violated. Other concerns address specific provisions of the 2008 amendments such as the declaration requirements for plants and plant products imported into the United States. Several businesses have suggested that the declaration requirements for importing plants and plant products are cumbersome and in some cases, not possible to meet. For example, some claim that identifying species for the declaration can be difficult for composite wood materials or some finished products where the wood has been modified from its natural state. Compliance with other requirements in the act is another issue. Some contend that plants and plant products imported before 2008 should be exempt from the law. They note that getting declaration information about these products, sometimes years after importation, can be difficult. To temper these criticisms of the 2008 amendments of the Lacey Act, some are reiterating the intended positive effects of the amendments, such as the potential economic benefits of reducing illegal logging and the potential environmental benefits of reducing deforestation and corruption associated with the illegal timber trade. Congressional interest in this issue stems in part from the wide-reaching applicability of the Lacey Act for U.S. industries and consumers and the environmental and economic benefits of reducing illegal logging. The 2008 amendments to the Lacey Act affect all industries that import plant and plant products, including musical instrument makers, furniture manufacturers, flooring companies, toy manufacturers, the auto industry, and some textile manufacturers that use fabrics that contain plant fibers. The 2008 amendments are expected to reduce illegal logging, which will reduce corrupt practices and increase biodiversity and conservation in timber-supplying countries, and increase revenues for foreign and domestic companies that sell and process wood. The 113 th Congress has addressed the 2008 amendments with proposed legislation. H.R. 3324 would amend the Lacey Act so that importers would need to possess and make available certain information about the plant or plant products being imported. Currently, importers are required to file this information. Further, the bill would amend the rulemaking authority of the Secretary to give more flexibility for specifying the applicability of declaration requirements. H.R. 3280 would amend the Lacey Act to exempt plants and plant products imported before May 22, 2008, from the Lacey Act. This section reviews the implementation of declaration requirements, enforcement, and funding under the 2008 amendments. Policy issues associated with implementation are discussed below in "" Issues and Legislative Options ."" Under the Lacey Act, all plants or plant products being imported into the country must be declared, with some exceptions that include common cultivars, packaging material, and scientific specimens, among other things. The declaration is to be made by the importer at the time of import. According to APHIS, the declaration requirements in the 2008 amendments are expected to facilitate accountability and improve data collection on plant imports. Similar declaration requirements are used for the import of wildlife to the United States. The declaration for plants and plant products is to provide: the scientific name of any plant (genus and species) contained in the importation; the value of the plant or plant product; the quantity of the plants or plant products (including the unit of measure); and the country of origin of where the plant was taken. In cases where multiple species are found in a product, there are some variations to the declaration. If a product contains material from several different plants, of which the names of the species are uncertain, the law states that the declaration should contain the names of all plant species that could have been used to create the product. Furthermore, if the exact country of origin is not known, the declaration must contain the names of all of the countries from where the plant species could have come. Information from submitted declarations is entered into a database, maintained by APHIS. It is unclear if this information will be openly available to the public. The declaration does not require information on the chain of custody of the product or its parts. For example, if a chair was fabricated in China with wood that was harvested and shipped from Indonesia, via Singapore, a full record of transactions throughout its fabrication process would not be necessary. The declaration will require the species of plant(s) used in the making of the chair (i.e., product imported), and the origin of each plant species used (e.g., Indonesia), and the value and quantity of the plant used. In some cases, the country of harvest for the declared plant material will be different from the country of export. APHIS has also developed a series of special use designations (SUDs) to ease some burdens of declarations. A SUD is an entered code that would substitute for certain required information. SUDs apply to specific products under designation regulations and are organized into three categories: The use of shorthand names for common trade groupings of species. (APHIS has a list of acceptable names.) The use of a special code to identify composite woods or recycled and reclaimed products if species and genus cannot be determined through a process of due care. Items manufactured prior to May 22, 2008, whose sources or species cannot be identified through a process of due care could be given a SUD. The declaration requirements were to be implemented by December 2008; however, APHIS delayed implementation due to concerns about the complexity of the requirements. Consequently, the declaration requirements on certain items were implemented on a delayed schedule between April 2009 and April 2010. The implementation of the declaration requirements is related to the Harmonized Tariff Schedule (HTS) of the United States, which classifies plants and plant products under certain codes in trade for duty, quota, and statistical purposes. Implementation is based on HTS codes and follows a schedule. Some more complex plant products (e.g., those containing specialty wood) were declared by April 2010 (e.g., musical instruments). Only items classified in the current implementation schedule are subject to enforcement for compliance with the declaration schedule, according to APHIS. Several other products containing wood parts, such as some firearms, furniture, and some toys, are being considered for phased-in implementation. APHIS has stated that it is not enforcing the declaration requirement for informal entries such as personal shipments. It is uncertain when or if these types of products will have to be declared. Any additions to the items requiring a declaration are expected to be reported in the Federal Register , according to APHIS. The 2008 amendments required a review of the declaration requirements and the effects of certain exclusions to the declaration requirements not more than two years after the enactment of the amendments (by May 22, 2010). APHIS published a notice in 2011 stating that it is initiating this review and seeking comments on the implementation of the declaration requirements. Further, 180 days after the review is complete, a report reviewing the implementation of declaration requirements is to be submitted to appropriate congressional committees. The report is to contain: an evaluation of the effectiveness of the declaration requirements in assisting enforcement of the requirements and efforts to integrate the requirements with other import regulations; recommendations for legislation that would assist in the identification of plants that are imported into the United States illegally; and an analysis of the effect of prohibitions and declaration requirements on the cost of legal plant imports and the effect on illegal logging practices and trafficking. A report was completed in May 2013 and sent to Congress. The report discusses some statistics of declaration requirements. For example, APHIS is receiving approximately 40,000 declarations per month (5,000 per month on paper, the rest electronically), and, of the declarations sent, approximately 32% are missing some aspect of the declaration. The report also mentions some of the issues associated with declarations. These range from importers not being able to identify species and genus of plants in products to mislabeling the country of harvest of the species. Further, the report discusses difficulties in processing the magnitude of paper declarations and the unsuccessful pilot program to create and implement blanket declarations. The report did not suggest recommendations for creating legislation to ease declaration requirements, but did emphasize the use of SUDs to ease the burden of declaring goods for importers. Regulations to reflect the study's findings may be promulgated 180 days after the review discussed above. The 2008 amendments authorize the regulations to include limits on the applicability of the declaration requirements to specific plant products; modifications to the requirements based on the review; and limits to the scope of the exclusions to the declaration requirement if they are warranted according to the review. No recommendations for changing the regulations of the 2008 amendments have been promulgated, although SUDs are in place to address some issues. The Lacey Act states that the provisions and subsequent regulations under the act are to be enforced by the Secretaries of the Interior and Commerce, and in the case of plants, also the Secretary of Agriculture. Agencies—for example, CBP, the U.S. Coast Guard (e.g., for fisheries violations), the National Marine Fisheries Service, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the U.S. Forest Service, the Office of the Inspector General, and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement—also can enforce the Lacey Act through inspection or monitoring activities. The Lacey Act can be enforced at the border or through investigations. Agents at ports of entry inspect imports and monitor the declaration process. Inspectors can initiate and conduct investigations into violations of the Lacey Act. The FWS Office of Law Enforcement reported 2,474 investigations related to the Lacey Act in 2012. Enforcement of the Lacey Act sometimes depends on an understanding of what foreign laws might have been violated. There is no federal database of foreign wildlife and plant laws, thus making enforcement of the law challenging. However, to facilitate investigations, officials might use information gained from foreign governments, nongovernmental organizations, private citizens, anonymous tips, declarations, industry, and border agents, among others, during the investigation. Officials are also authorized to provide rewards to informants that lead to the arrest, conviction, or assessment of fines to a violator. A Lacey Act violation requires two actions to be taken. If a person violates a U.S. or tribal law by taking, possessing, transporting, or selling any fish, wildlife, or plant (or plant product), the Lacey Act is violated if that fish, wildlife, or plant is then imported, exported, transported, sold, received, acquired, or purchased. It is slightly different for violations of state or foreign laws, which require that the import, export, transport, sale, receipt, acquisition, or purchase of the fish, wildlife, or plant be in interstate or foreign commerce before there can be a violation. A Lacey Act violation can result in civil penalties that could involve fines and forfeiture of wildlife, plants, and products, and criminal penalties that could involve fines, forfeiture, and incarceration. The Lacey Act does not authorize funding to implement the act or enforce provisions within the act. However, funding for implementing the act could come from discretionary appropriations. The Secretary is directed to identify funds used to enforce the Lacey Act and any regulations as a special appropriations item in the Department of the Interior appropriations budget proposal to Congress. Funds for implementing the act could come from other accounts in federal agencies. For example, funds for FWS investigators to enforce laws that address fish, wildlife, and plant resources are provided under the Office of Law Enforcement line item for FWS. This program received $62.3 million for FY2013. This office also funds law enforcement officials to monitor and investigate the wildlife trade. The office has 219 agents and 143 inspectors on staff for FY2012. In FY2012, investigators conducted 12,996 investigations, of which 2,474 involved the Lacey Act. FWS also has an international wildlife trade program that implements domestic laws and international treaties that address the wildlife trade. APHIS also funds the implementation of the Lacey Act. Money taken from penalties and fines under the Lacey Act can be deposited into the Lacey Act Reward Fund. Money in this fund can be used to provide rewards to people who provide information that leads to an arrest, criminal conviction, and other things. Money can also be used to reimburse costs to those providing temporary care to fish, wildlife, or plants while a case is ongoing. Several policy issues are associated with the 2008 amendments, ranging from questions about the overall purpose and function of the Lacey Act to issues about specific provisions in the act such as the declaration requirements. Several environmental, trade, and industry groups have formed coalitions to identify issues and suggest solutions. Some coalitions who primarily have issues with the declaration requirements have proposed solutions that they contend could be addressed by regulations. Others contend that the regulatory process has not worked and congressional action is needed. This section discusses selected policy issues associated with the 2008 amendments and summarizes proposed and potential legislative and regulatory options. Under the Lacey Act, the importer is responsible for making sure that imported plants and plant products are legally harvested, processed, and imported. This could involve monitoring the production of plant products and verifying that plants and plant products are being harvested, processed, and imported legally under foreign laws. This requirement has been interpreted by some as requiring the United States to enforce foreign laws, which some contend should be the responsibility of the country who established the laws. Others contend that the United States contributes to illegal trade by being one of the largest consumers of plant and plant product imports, and therefore is in a special position to apply demand-side pressure to ensure legally sourced plants and plant products for export. Some might argue that there is limited potential to lower the level of illegal trade of plants and wildlife, since the illegal trade could shift away from responsible importers (i.e., U.S. importers following the Lacey Act) to those in countries with fewer restrictions. In the case of illegal logging, however, this argument is waning since other countries or blocks of countries are adopting regulations similar to the Lacey Act. For example, the European Union (EU) has adopted a regulation that prohibits the entry of illegally harvested timber into the European market. The responsibility for regulating timber falls on those who put plants and plant products in the market (e.g., importers and producers). Illegally harvested is defined under the regulation as ""harvested in contravention of the applicable legislation in the country of harvest."" The regulation applies to both timber imported into the EU and timber produced within the EU. The regulation requires that those placing timber or timber products into the market practice due diligence. Further, the regulation will require that those who buy and sell timber or timber products on the market be able to identify their suppliers and customers so that the timber and timber products can be traced. Australia has also passed a law similar to the Lacey Act and the EU regulation. This law prohibits the import of timber products that contain illegally logged timber; requires importers to undertake due diligence to mitigate the risk of products containing illegally logged timber; and establishes a monitoring, enforcement, and investigation regime. If a large portion of the world market for timber adopts regulations similar to the 2008 amendments, such as the EU regulations, the market for illegally harvested or processed plants and plant products would be expected to decrease because the consumer base addressing illegal logging would presumably increase. There is no proposed legislation in the 113 th Congress that attempts to remove foreign laws from the coverage of the Lacey Act. Some contend that the 2008 amendments of the Lacey Act overreach the original intent of their proponents by addressing laws that are not related to conservation. For example, the act makes it unlawful to possess any plant that was processed illegally according to a foreign law. As discussed in the Gibson guitar case, exporting unfinished wood conforming to HS 4407 from India is a violation of Indian law governing exports and hence a potential violation of the Lacey Act. Some could contend that illegally processing wood might not have a direct effect on conservation. Indeed, under the 2008 amendments, harvesting and exporting wood where applicable conservation laws and payment of fees and taxes are followed could still violate a country's export law (e.g., due to restrictions on unfinished wood exports) and therefore would be prohibited under the Lacey Act if the plant or plant products are imported into the United States. Counter to the argument that the Lacey Act overreaches its intent, others defend the legitimacy of the Lacey Act as a conservation tool. They contend that all areas covered by the Lacey Act, including export laws, have some connection to conservation. Enforcing payments of stumpage fees and taxes, for example, takes away the financial benefits of illegal logging and could provide revenue for conservation activities (e.g., more law enforcement officers). They also contend that enforcing export laws lowers the influx of illegal plants and plant products onto the market. For example, legally required processing or finishing of wood could provide another layer of oversight on the trade of plants and plant products, and could also increase the transparency of the supply chain of the plants and plant products, making enforcement of foreign laws easier. Removing violations of foreign laws from the Lacey Act would address this issue, yet would narrow the scope of the act significantly. Another alternative, as discussed above, would be to limit the applicability of foreign laws to those laws that directly address the protection, conservation, and management of plants. This would also narrow the scope of the law, but would keep it focused on addressing conservation. However, some might contend that violations not related to conservation might lead to charges that ultimately might address conservation. The enactment and implementation of the 2008 amendments has led some to contend that the law increases costs for certain companies and could result in the loss of jobs. Others, in contrast, contend that the law increases revenue for certain companies and thus could lead to job creation. There has been no comprehensive analysis of the costs and benefits of the 2008 amendments for various types of plant and plant product industries. This section discusses the potential areas of costs and benefits of the 2008 amendments. The primary costs to comply with the 2008 amendments are attributable to exercising due care to ensure that imported plants and plant products are harvested and processed legally, and to comply with the declaration requirements. According to H.Rept. 112-604 , APHIS has stated that it is receiving approximately 40,000 declarations per month, at a cost of $56 million annually for regulated entities. This figure could be higher when the Lacey Act is fully implemented. The costs of compliance for regulated entities depend on the amount of due care conducted by the importer and the cost of declaration requirements. Larger companies might have more resources to exercise due care than smaller companies. Further, those importing large quantities of wood or products from single sources might have lower costs applying due care than those purchasing small quantities of specialized wood or products from several sources. In addition to costs of due care, other costs might come from complying with declaration requirements. Identifying the species and genus of wood products and filling out paperwork for declarations could require additional staff for companies importing wood and wood products. Indirect costs may result from changing trade partners that might not be able to verify the legality of their wood products. This might involve searching for new markets and establishing business with new companies. Last, there are costs associated with violations created by the 2008 amendments. Violations could result in penalties up to $500,000 for criminal violations and forfeitures of goods, which can be costly depending on the quantity and species of plants or plant products confiscated. One of the primary benefits of the 2008 amendments is based on the premise that reducing illegal logging would increase revenues for legal logging operations in the United States and other countries. As discussed before, illegally logged wood is cheaper to bring to market and likely depresses wood prices for both domestic and international markets. Based on this premise, if illegally logged wood were removed from the market, prices for legally harvested wood would probably increase. According to one study, this increase could be 7%-16% annually. Less illegally harvested wood in the market could lead to an increase in the demand for legally harvested wood, causing an upward pressure on prices. To illustrate the benefits of the 2008 amendments, several cite a trade report that estimated that illegal logging contributed approximately $1 billion annually in economic losses to the U.S. forest products industry in the form of lower exports and depressed wood prices. Some contend that the revenue gained from lowering the influx of illegally harvested wood into the market could lead to more domestic jobs. Another economic benefit of reducing illegal logging would be increasing revenues for governments in countries where wood is harvested. Studies have shown that illegal logging leads to corruption and evasion of paying fees and taxes for harvested and processed wood. The World Bank estimated that governments lose approximately $15 billion annually due to illegal logging, due primarily to lost revenue from taxes and fees. It is difficult to assess whether the 2008 amendments to the Lacey Act have been effective in reducing illegal logging around the world. There have been no comprehensive studies assessing the effect of the amendments on the logging industry. Some suggest anecdotally that foreign logging operations in China and Vietnam are paying closer attention to complying with local laws because of consumer-driven pressure. Others, however, might contend that restrictions on selling illegally harvested wood to U.S. companies might drive sales of illegally harvested wood higher to companies from countries that do not have restrictions on purchasing illegally harvested wood (i.e., leakage), potentially reducing the effect of the Lacey Act on illegal logging. The declaration requirements for plants and plant products under the 2008 amendments are controversial. Some contend that the declaration requirements are a burden and difficult to comply with under certain circumstances. For example, a case study of IKEA's procurement strategy noted that it would take 25 person-years annually to complete the declaration forms for IKEA's supply chain. Further, it notes that a single shipment might generate a 1,000-page document for a declaration because of all the products being shipped. Others are concerned with specific parts of the declaration requirements and have suggested modifications. Proponents of the declaration requirements, in general, contend that they are necessary to ensure compliance with the provisions of the Lacey Act and serve as an oversight mechanism for compliance. Some contend that wood in certain plant products is difficult to identify by genus and species. For example, for composite products and materials (i.e., products that contain more than one species of wood such as particleboard), it is difficult to identify the genus and species of all the component fibers because numerous species of wood can be used to make the products. Some have suggested that these types of wood products be excluded from the declaration requirements until it is feasible to identify various fibers by species. The law attempts to address complications with identifying several species of wood in products. For example, if the species of wood used in products is uncertain, one may declare all species of wood that the product could contain. Therefore, if a composite wood product is created from by-products from several species, listing the species that may have been used to create the product would satisfy the declaration requirement. However, APHIS has acknowledged that this might not be enough to facilitate the declaration of composite wood, and has asked for information on this issue to consider regulatory options. In the request for comments for potential changes in regulations, APHIS proposes a definition for composite wood and identifies two possible approaches for declaring composite wood through regulations. APHIS would define composite wood as consisting of plant material that has been chemically or mechanically broken down and reconstituted. The approaches to declaring composite wood would involve applying a type of de minimis standard to the wood. One approach is to identify the genus, species, and country of harvest for no less than a given percentage of the wood contained in the product. The percentage could be measured in terms of weight or volume. The second approach would be to declare the ""average percent composite plant content"" of the product, without regard for the species and country of harvest for the plant. Non-composite plant material would still need the genus, species, and country of harvest in the declaration. A de minimis standard has also been proposed for certain types of products that contain plant materials which are highly processed and are in small quantities. Some argue that identifying these plant materials is difficult due to the level of processing they have undergone and their small quantity in the product. Under this proposal, plant materials in certain products would be excluded from the declaration requirements. Product examples include cosmetics, personal care products, textiles, and rubber or cork products. Proponents of this proposal contend that federal agencies have rulemaking authority to make these exclusions, but that congressional action might be needed to clarify the agency's authority to establish exclusions to the declaration requirements. APHIS has addressed this issue, in part, with the use of SUDs. SUDs provide a special code to identify composite woods or recycled and reclaimed products if species and genus cannot be determined through a process of due care. Specific guidelines on using SUDs are provided. Some counter the need for modifications to the declaration requirements because they contend that knowing the type and source of wood is important for ensuring legal practices and countering the illegal trade. They specifically oppose suggestions to broaden the exemptions of plant products from declaration requirements, arguing that modifications proposed in H.R. 3210 would have excluded pulp and paper, which constitute a significant portion of the plant imports into the United States, from declaration requirements. Some contend that repeated or regular declarations of the same plant products add administrative burden and extra costs on industries without providing additional benefits for tracing the source of wood. A proposal to address this issue would allow for a blanket declaration. In a blanket declaration, importers would submit one declaration for similar products imported over a period of time, thus potentially saving the importer from submitting duplicate declarations for each product imported. APHIS has responded to this issue by initiating the Lacey Act Blanket Declaration Pilot Program in 2009 to test the feasibility of collecting information through a blanket declaration. Eligible importers can participate in the program. A blanket declaration will apply for one month, and a reconciliation report providing how much was actually imported during the month is due within 15 days after the end of the month. The report to Congress submitted by APHIS stated that this pilot project was not a success. Further, a survey revealed that users felt the program was duplicative of efforts related to declarations. The modification of declaration requirements can be done either through regulations or by law. Regulatory changes to the declaration requirements under the Lacey Act can be implemented from recommendations provided by certain reports and reviews. As discussed above, under the Lacey Act, the Secretary is required to review the declaration requirements and report findings to appropriate congressional committees. The report to Congress contains information on several factors, including an evaluation of the effectiveness of declaration requirements. The Secretary is authorized to promulgate regulations that could modify certain declaration requirements for plant products 180 days after the Secretary completes the review. For example, the Secretary could limit the applicability of declaration requirements to any plant product; make changes to declaration requirements for plant products that are suggested in the review; and limit the scope of exclusions if they are justified by the review. This could be an avenue for excluding products (e.g., composite wood products) that are difficult to declare. It is unclear, however, if these regulations could be used to exempt plant products made before 2008 from the declaration process. In the 113 th Congress, H.R. 3324 would amend the Lacey Act so that importers would need to possess and make available certain information about the plant or plant products being imported. Currently, importers are required to file this information. This would lower the burden of processing declarations for APHIS, but would not lower the burden of creating declarations by the importers. Therefore, many of the issues associated with identifying species and genus, or country of origin, would remain. Further, the bill would amend the rulemaking authority of the Secretary to give more flexibility on the applicability of declaration requirements. Some contend that the 2008 amendments should not apply to plants imported or plant products created or imported before 2008. They note that declaration requirements under the act are difficult to complete for these plant products because the sources and species of plants used might not be known, since they were not required by law to be identified. In the 113 th Congress, H.R. 3280 proposes to exclude plants from the Lacey Act that were imported into the United States before May 22, 2008, or plant products created before May 22, 2008. The intent of this provision appeared to be to exclude plant products created and imported before 2008 from Lacey Act coverage and clarify any doubts or interpretations of the law. Note that this provision would not cover plants harvested before 2008 that were not imported before the act took effect, making them still subject to the Lacey Act. The primary method by which U.S. importers can protect themselves from criminal and certain civil penalties under the Lacey Act is to exercise due care in determining if the imported plants or plant products were legally harvested, processed, and exported. The exercise of due care refers to the amount of attention and effort that a reasonable person would expend in a similar situation to address an issue or conduct an activity. Some contend that the actions needed to demonstrate due care with respect to the Lacey Act are not sufficiently defined or clear. Some definitions of due care are found in S.Rept. 97-123, which accompanied the Lacey Act amendments of 1981, and in guidance provided by federal agencies. S.Rept. 97-123 states that ""due care means that degree of care which a reasonably prudent person would exercise under the same or similar circumstances."" Further, the Senate report notes that due care requires that a person under certain circumstances take steps that a reasonable person would take under similar circumstances to insure they are not violating the law. The exercise of due care is pivotal for determining penalties under the Lacey Act. Under the Lacey Act, certain civil and criminal violations and forfeitures can be imposed on persons if they engaged in conduct prohibited by the act. If they knowingly engaged in prohibited conduct, the penalties are steeper than if they unknowingly engaged in prohibited conduct. If they unknowingly committed a violation without exercising due care, their penalties are steeper than if they exercised due care and unknowingly committed a violation. (See Figure 1 .) Therefore, persons who exercise sufficient due care to determine if their plants or plant products were taken, possessed, transported, or sold in violation of laws, treaties, or regulations might not be held liable for certain violations under the act if a violation is committed unknowingly. However, exercising due care and unknowingly committing a violation could still result in penalties under the Lacey Act, such as forfeiting goods. The due care standard does not apply to marking or labeling violations, and is excluded from declaration requirements under the Lacey Act. According to S.Rept. 97-123, the intent behind incorporating a due care standard in the Lacey Act was to lower the potential for abusive and indiscriminate enforcement efforts. The Senate report also notes that the degree of due care is ""applied differently to different categories of persons with varying degrees of knowledge and responsibility."" For example, a horticulturalist in a professional capacity and with experience in the plant trade could be expected to apply greater knowledge toward correctly identifying plants and verifying permits than would be expected of an airline company that transported plants to the United States and has little knowledge of the plant trade and plant species. Some practical measures one could take to demonstrate due care are given by APHIS. For example, importers can ask questions about the chain of custody of the wood, implement compliance plans, abide by industry standards, record efforts at each stage of the supply chain, and change their practices in response to practical experiences. Some red flags that might indicate violations of logging or processing laws offered by APHIS include: goods trading significantly below their common market rate; cash transactions without paperwork; invalid or falsified documents or permits; and unusual sales practices or transactions. Some suggest that the Lacey Act Compliance Program described in the agreement with Gibson Guitar could be viewed as a guideline for how due care might be interpreted or applied to the 2008 amendments. The due care standard in the Compliance Program states that Gibson should follow a number of steps before buying wood or a wood product. They include: communicating with suppliers to determine any challenges they might have in implementing policies within the program; determining the origin of the wood from discussions with the supplier; conducting independent research to determine risky sources of wood or the potential for false documentation; requesting sample documentation to evaluate compliance and validity; making a determination of legality before purchasing wood and maintaining records of these effects; and declining to purchase wood if there is any uncertainty of illegality. Gibson is to supplement these requirements by continuing its own policies. Some policies include procuring wood sourced from forests where legal harvest and chain of custody can be certified by a third party, such as the Forest Stewardship Council. Further, when working with a new supplier, Gibson is to study foreign laws, verify certifications, and use watch lists to determine the risk of procuring illegal wood. This standard and compliance program is binding only to Gibson Guitar and is not intended to be a pronouncement of what DOJ intends due care to mean with respect to the 2008 amendments. Establishing a process for exercising due care under the Lacey Act when dealing with plants and plant products has been proposed for clarifying guidelines. Some suggest that a process for exercising due care should have steps a person or company can take to verify that their imported plants and plant products comply with the Lacey Act, ultimately leading to a type of certification for the plant or plant product. The process could consider certification of individual items as well as certification of manufacturers, importers, and retailers. Others are also considering a process for satisfying due care. A group of stakeholders associated with the trade of plants and plant products and conservation is creating a process that aims to define due care under the Lacey Act. Their standard centers on obtaining a type of forest certification that ensures the forest is protected and conducting risk, compliance, and legal audits related to potential illegal activities. A process for exercising due care has been adopted by the European Union (EU) in regulations that aim to curb illegal logging. The process has three primary elements that are to be provided: Information on the timber and timber products, including a description and scientific name of the timber, country of harvest, quantity of the timber or product, details on the supplier and purchaser, and documents indicating compliance with national legislation. A risk assessment of the timber being illegal throughout its supply chain based on information gathered and risk assessment criteria, which include compliance with applicable legislation, prevalence of illegal logging of specific species in the country of harvest, international sanctions on imports of timber, and complexity of the supply chain. Risk mitigation addressing the risks noted in the previous point, which can include gathering additional information and verification of legality from the supplier of the timber, including obtaining third party verification. The regulation also provides for monitoring organizations to be recognized. These organizations are expected to provide EU operators due care systems, which they can accept or refuse in lieu of creating their own system. The EU system for due diligence is similar to the 2008 amendments, but potentially more involved. Under the EU system, information on the chain of custody and a calculation for mitigating risks is required; this information is not required under the 2008 amendments. Clarity on how to exercise due care and a defense against charges when due care is exercised are two potential benefits of implementing a process for exercising due care. A process that specifies steps to ensure the legality of imported products would reduce confusion as to how due care is exercised, and provide consistent practices among importers, thus making it easier for them to coordinate efforts to verify the legality of their products. This could also lower the costs of compliance. Further, monitoring compliance according to a process could give law enforcement officials a benchmark for bringing charges against an importer who may not have taken sufficient steps to exercise due care. Potential drawbacks of establishing and implementing a process to exercise due care include determining the level of reliability for verifying timber practices in foreign countries and the potential for violations to go unnoticed when due care is applied. One component of a due care process might be employing third parties to verify timber operations in foreign countries (i.e., certification scheme). Third parties can invest resources in particular countries to monitor logging and processing operations for several importers, and provide a certificate to operations that comply with the law. For example, the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) certifies timber operations to ensure legal, sustainable management of forested land and monitors the chain of custody to trace the life cycle of wood products originating in a certified forest. The effectiveness of third parties to monitor all aspects of plant harvesting and production, however, has been questioned by some. They claim that corruption and fraud can take place, thus undercutting the ability to certify legal wood. This would lower the credibility of the standard and lower its effect in curbing illegal logging. Further, some certification schemes might not cover all aspects of a due care process and the timber and timber products in question. FSC, for example, does not apply rigorous oversight to ""FSC Controlled Wood,"" which is non-FSC-certified wood that is allowed to be mixed with FSC-certified wood. Further, certification schemes may not cover all steps in the succession from harvesting to importation. For example, FSC standards would not cover some laws dealing with the export or processing of wood after harvest that would be subject to the Lacey Act. Exercising due care for importing plants and plant products under the Lacey Act can be challenging for importers because it requires an understanding of foreign laws and practices, and possibly monitoring in the foreign country where plant and plant materials are being harvested. Some contend that exercising due care is complicated by the quantity of foreign laws related to plants and plant products. For example, Indonesia has more than 900 laws, regulations, and decrees that address timber harvesting and processing. There is no federal database that compiles and presents foreign laws that apply to plants and plant products. According to APHIS, importers are responsible for being aware of any foreign laws that apply to the plants and plant products they are importing. Some have suggested other options for reducing illegal logging that would help importers exercise due care. These options would be supply-side driven. One option is to encourage timber-producing countries to construct timber legality standards that could be implemented as voluntary guidelines or mandatory procedures for domestic timber operations. Supply-side guidelines were implemented in a trade agreement between the United States and Peru in 2006 to address illegal logging in Peru. For example, Peru is required to implement several measures to deter illegal logging within the country, such as increasing the number of enforcement personnel, imposing criminal and civil penalties under existing laws to deter illegal logging, monitoring endangered plant species, verifying and auditing exporters and producers of timber products, and developing tools that strengthen regulatory controls and verification systems related to the harvest and trade of timber products. Individual countries have also initiated legality standards to differentiate between legal and illegal sources of wood. Indonesia, for example, has a standard with several indicators that address timber operations and forest management. Independent auditors assess timber concessions and factories against the standard and award certificates for legal operations. Another option is to promote international cooperation and coordination to identify areas of legal and illegal logging practices. With the advent of the EU regulation, opportunities exist for coordination among a large range of importers spanning two of the largest markets for plant and plant product exports—Europe and North America. Efforts could be made to identify ""hot spots"" where illegal logging is common, as well as areas where legal practices prevail. This could create incentives for suppliers to be placed on the legal lists. Further, identifying areas where illegal logging or trade exists could warn importers of areas in their supply chains they should be wary about. This might also encourage importers to change their supply chains so as to avoid these areas. However, these lists could be subjectively created and generate controversy by countries that are on the list. For example, some might question how many infractions would cause a country to be listed, or how a country could come off the list. Legal operators in the listed country might also argue that they are being unfairly targeted because of the crimes of others in their country. Some have suggested strengthening existing federal programs aimed at reducing illegal logging in foreign countries as a mechanism to make compliance with the Lacey Act easier. Some examples include programs at the U.S. Agency of International Development and Department of State that aim to educate foreign companies about the Lacey Act and provide funds to improve forest governance and law enforcement in foreign countries. An example is the Tropical Forest Conservation Act. Under this program, debt restructured in eligible countries generates funds to support programs to conserve tropical forests within the debtor country. Some of the eligible activities include improving law enforcement capacity in reserves to address illegal logging. This helps importers by reducing illegal logging practices in countries that supply plants and plant products. Some aspects of the 2008 Lacey Act Amendments have been controversial, and several observers and stakeholders have suggested potential changes. Some contend that changes should be done through law; others argue that changes should be done through regulations. Some contend that efforts to change the implementation of the Lacey Act through regulations have stalled and not produced results. This is supported, in part, by the delay by APHIS in producing a review report of implementing declaration requirements under the act. Based on this report, the Secretary is authorized to make certain changes to the declaration requirements. Some take a broader look at the Lacey Act and contend that understanding and applying foreign laws to the processes of harvesting and producing plant and wildlife products is not feasible for the average person or corporation in the United States. Thus, some might consider removing violations of foreign laws from the Lacey Act. Proponents of making changes through regulations contend that amending the act could lead to additional changes in the law that are not contemplated or supported by various stakeholders. They also contend that amending the law is subverting the intended process of making changes through regulations. ","The Lacey Act regulates the trade of wildlife and plants and creates penalties for a broad spectrum of violations. In 2008, the Lacey Act was amended to include protections for foreign plants and to require adherence to foreign laws as they pertain to certain conservation and other activities involving plants. Further, the 2008 amendments make it unlawful to submit falsified documents related to any plant or plant product covered by the act, and to import certain plants and plant products without an import declaration. The primary drivers behind the Lacey Act amendments of 2008 (2008 amendments) were to reduce illegal logging globally and increase the value of U.S. wood exports. Illegal logging is a pervasive problem with economic and environmental consequences. Some estimate that illegal logging accounts for 15%-30% of the volume of all forest extraction activities globally, and has an estimated worth of $30 billion-$100 billion of the global wood trade. Further, if there were no illegally logged wood in the global market, it has been projected that the value of U.S. exports of roundwood, sawnwood, and panels could increase by an average of approximately $460 million each year. A halt to illegal logging would also raise the value of domestic wood production. If this is added to exports, some estimate the increase in revenue for companies in the United States at approximately $1.0 billion annually. A highly publicized raid on Gibson Guitar Corporation brought to light several existing policy issues related to the 2008 amendments to the Lacey Act. Some issues are broad and address the intent of the act. For example, some question why U.S. importers should be held responsible for violations of foreign law or if the requirements under the Lacey Act actually reduce illegal logging. Other issues are narrow and address certain requirements in the act. For example, several suggest that the declaration requirements for importing plants and plant products are cumbersome and cannot be met in some cases. Further, some contend that the 2008 amendments should not apply to plants harvested or plant products fabricated before the 2008 amendments were enacted. In contrast, some reiterate the benefits of the 2008 amendments, primarily reducing illegal logging and increasing the value of legally obtained plants and plant products on the market. The 113th Congress is attempting to address some of these issues in proposed legislation. H.R. 3324 would amend the Lacey Act so that importers would need to possess and make available certain information about the plant or plant products being imported. Currently, importers are required to file this information. Further, the bill would amend the rulemaking authority of the Secretary to give more flexibility for specifying the applicability of declaration requirements. H.R. 3280 would amend the Lacey Act to exempt plants and plant products imported before May 22, 2008, from the Lacey Act. Efforts to address implementation issues could also be pursued through regulations. The law requires a review of the implementation of the Lacey Act by the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service and a report evaluating and analyzing some implementation requirements and providing recommendations to improve plant identification. Further, the Secretary (e.g., Secretary of Interior, Commerce, or Agriculture) may promulgate regulations that aim to improve implementation as discussed in the review.",govreport
"RS20913 -- Farm ""Counter-Cyclical Assistance"" Updated May 31, 2002 Farming often is characterized as a ""cyclical"" business with exaggerated price swings that are destabilizing. Farmersrespond to high prices by boosting output. However, when prices drop, farmers are not quick to cut backproduction. Theyare more likely to operate at a loss and draw down resources. Contributing to the unstable nature of the farmeconomy arethe weather, export demand, currency exchange rate fluctuations, and the farm support and export subsidy programsofforeign competitors. Typically, farmers do not view the eventual self-correcting character of commodity prices and production with the sameequanimity as economists. In fact, U.S. producers of the major crops have asked for and received federalintervention --including various forms of counter-cyclical assistance -- to support their commodity prices and incomes for nearlythe past70 years. Between 1973 and 1995, a prominent form of counter-cyclical aid was deficiency payments linked to target prices. Congress specified, for each major crop, an annual per-unit target price (e.g., $4 per bushel for wheat). If, as oftenoccurred, the market price was below the target price, eligible producers received a deficiency payment to make upthedifference. This aid was ended by the Federal Agriculture Improvement and Reform (FAIR) Act of 1996 ( P.L.104-127 ). Under Title I of the 1996 Act, fixed production flexibility contract (PFC) payments replaced target price deficiencypayments. These payments were intended to provide, over 7 years, a total of about $36 billion to eligible producersorlandowners. The PFC payments were not linked to either current production or prices. By design, lawmakersintended thatthese fixed payments, along with the ability to make unconstrained planting decisions, would cause the marketplaceratherthan subsidies to guide farmers' production choices. However, the 1996 law did continue another form of counter-cyclical support: marketing assistance loans. Producers could(and, under the new 2002 law, continue to) pledge their stored grain, cotton, or oilseeds as collateral for a U.S.Departmentof Agriculture (USDA) nonrecourse commodity loan after harvest. These loans are based on a per-unit (bushel,pound)rate. In earlier years, these nonrecourse loans were set higher than market prices in order to support farm incomes, and farmersforfeited the commodities pledged as collateral at the end of the loan term (about 9 months). Under the more recentdesign,farmers can repay the nonrecourse ""marketing assistance loans"" at less than the original loan rate when market pricesarelower than that loan rate. The difference between the USDA loan rate and the lower repayment rate (times thenumber ofbushels under loan) constitutes the federal subsidy. In addition, those producers who choose not take out USDAcommodity loans can instead receive the equivalent subsidy as a direct payment, called a ""loan deficiency payment""(LDP). The federal subsidy (either a loan gain or LDP) increases as market prices drop below the loan rate, and the subsidydiminishes as prices rise -- thus, the ""counter-cyclical"" nature of the marketing loan program. When the 1996 farm bill was passed, commodity prices were relatively high, and policymakers widely anticipated that thePFC payments, when combined with whatever was earned from the market, would provide sufficient income toproducers. Marketing loans were set at relatively low rates so that they only would be needed as a safety net if prices declinedrelatively steeply. However, by the late 1990s, major commodity prices declined even more than expected, andgenerallydid not recover to what farmers regarded as acceptable levels. As a result, they relied heavily on marketing loanbenefits,which went from zero in FY1996, to a high of over $8 billion in FY2000 (the cost has declined somewhat sincethen). Congress determined that the ""safety net"" provided by the 1996 FAIR Act (i.e., marketing assistance loans and fixed PFCpayments) was inadequate, and supplemented the benefits with additional, emergency ""market loss payments."" Thesepayments, mainly to PFC enrollees, added about $3 billion in FY1999, $11 billion in FY2000, and $5.5 billion inFY2001to program costs. These supplemental payments also can be characterized as counter-cyclical -- even though theyare adhoc and not ""programmed"" into standing law -- because they were made (according to the sponsors) inresponse to lowprices and incomes. Nearly all of the numerous farm and commodity organizations that testified before the House and Senate AgricultureCommittees in 2001 requested that additional counter-cyclical support be developed as a supplement to the currentmarketing assistance loans and fixed annual payments. In response, the separate farm bills passed in October 2001by theHouse and February 2002 by the Senate, incorporated new counter-cyclical measures into standing law. Thus,Congresspresumably would no longer have to debate and enact periodic emergency ad hoc assistance. The final farm bill, the Farm Security and Rural Investment Act (FSRIA) of 2002 ( H.R. 2646 , P.L. 107-171 ),provides new long-term counter-cyclical support for grains and cotton, by restoring target prices and deficiencypayments,similar in some respects to the program terminated by the 1996 Act. What are now called annual PFC paymentsarereplaced with fixed, ""direct payments"" to farmers. Both types of payments will be available to producers withannualagreements with USDA. In addition, the measure maintains marketing assistance loans and loan deficiencypayments asthey now function, with changes in most loan rates. The new law, which covers the 2002-2007 crop years, brings soybeans and the minor oilseeds (e.g., sunflowers, etc.) fullyunder the support program rules that apply to grains and cotton. In a major departure from the past, FSRIAredesignspeanut support to operate like that for grains, oilseeds, and cotton -- instead of the traditional system of peanutmarketingquotas and nonrecourse price support loans. Under the new law, fixed payments and target price deficiency payments will be paid on 85% of each farm's baseproduction (base acres times base yield of each commodity). A farmer may choose, as base production, either theacreageused for PFC payments, or average acres planted to eligible crops from 1998 through 2001. Yields effectively arethe1981-85 averages, except that, for counter-cyclical payments, yields also can be updated under astatutorily-prescribedformula. A key difference between the new target price payments and those made until 1995, is that the old payments were tied toannual planting rules (i.e., an acreage reduction program.) The new system is not contingent upon such rules:payments arebased upon historical, not current, production, and farmers can plant virtually any crops except most fruits andvegetables. Under the new counter-cyclical program, the deficiency payment rate will be calculated as the difference between the targetprice, and the lower average season market price (but not to exceed the difference between the target price and thesum ofthe loan rate and fixed payment). (See Table 1 for rates). An individual may receive no more than $130,000 peryear incounter-cyclical assistance. Milk support would continue under FSRIA through government purchases of nonfat dry milk, butter, and cheese. However, it has an added feature of counter-cyclical payments. Dairy farmers nationwide will be eligible for""nationaldairy market loss payments"" whenever the minimum monthly market price for farm milk used for fluid consumptioninBoston falls below $16.94 per hundredweight (cwt.). In order to receive a payment, a dairy farmer must enter intoacontract with the Secretary of Agriculture. The value of the payment equals 45% of the difference between the$16.94 percwt. target price in any month that the Boston market price falls below $16.94. A producer can receive a paymenton allmilk production during that month, but no payments will be made on any annual production in excess of 2.4 millionpoundsper dairy operation. All contracts expire on September 30, 2005. (See Dairy Farmer Counter-Cyclical Assistance in theCRS electronic briefing book on AgriculturePolicy and the Farm Bill .) Table 1. Loan Rates, Fixed Payment Rates, and Target Prices * Reflects rates that change in some years. NA=not applicable. Whereas the final farm bill ties the availability of counter-cyclical assistance to target prices for specified commodities,other designs also were discussed. For example: One plan would have triggered payments in a state whenever state (as opposed to national) gross cash receipts for any of eight program or oilseed crops are forecast for the year to be less than 94% of that state's annualaveragecash receipts for the crop during 1996-1999. Cash receipts would be defined as the national average price timesstate-levelproduction. Those who produced the crop during 1998-2000 would be eligible for a share of total payments(AmericanFarm Bureau Federation). Another would have established a ""national target income"" for each major crop: that is, the national average annual market value of the crop during 1996-2000, plus the annual average of any marketing loan benefitsandmarket loss assistance payments made during those years. A further adjustment would be made to account for yieldincreases since then. Those who produced that crop during 1996-2000 would be eligible for a share of totalpaymentswhenever returns (defined as the crop's U.S. production times the average price for the first 3 months of themarketingyear) are below the national target income for the crop (National Corn Growers Association). The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) has estimated the commodity support provisions (Title I) of FSRIA at $98.9billion over 6 years (budget authority, March 2002 estimate, FY2002-2007). This is $37.6 billion more than thebaselinepolicy of simply extending current programs into the future. The new counter-cyclical payments for grains, cotton,andoilseeds account for $23.6 billion of the new costs (i.e., above baseline). The peanut and dairy counter-cyclicalpaymentsare projected to cost, respectively, another $904 million and $963 million. However, such cost estimates are speculative due to the extreme difficulty of predicting future market conditions, includingprices. If prices are lower than CBO's assumptions, then costs will be higher, and vice versa. Some other analystsalreadyhave differing projections. For example, the Food and Agricultural Policy Research Institute (FAPRI) at the University of Missouri estimates that thetotal cost of the dairy program alone could exceed $3.6 billion. That's mainly because FAPRI projects significantlylowermarket prices for milk than CBO over the 46-month life of the program. CBO estimates that the average monthlypaymentrate over the 46-month life of the program will be about $0.45 per cwt.; FAPRI estimates an average monthlypayment rateof $0.89 per cwt. (See also What Is the Cost of the 2002 Farm Bill? in the CRS electronic briefing book on Agriculture Policy and the FarmBill .) The 1994 Uruguay Round Agreement on Agriculture (URAA) obligates countries to discipline their agricultural subsidyprograms and reduce import barriers in order to promote more open trade. Under the URAA, the United States iscommitted to providing subsidies of no more than $19.1 billion per year through domestic farm policies with themostpotential to distort production and trade. The URAA contains detailed rules for how countries should determine which of their programs must be counted towardtheir assigned subsidy limits (e.g., $19.1 billion for the United States). Generally, however, programs that are tiedtocurrent prices or current production must be counted (these are called ""amber box"" policies). Thus, marketing loangains,which rise when crop prices decline and vice versa, are ""amber"" and must be counted (but only if their value, alongwithother subsidies, exceeds 5% of the value of annual production of that crop). On the other hand, subsidies that are not linked to prices or production, and/or meet other specified criteria, might beexempted as ""green box"" policies. The United States has classified its PFC payments as ""green"" because they aremadewithout regard to prices or current production. It is anticipated the fixed, decoupled payments in the new law alsowill fallwithin the green box. The new counter-cyclical assistance will be decoupled from current output because the producer would not have to produceany particular crop now to receive the payments. However, because (like marketing loan gains) the target pricedeficiencypayments would be triggered by current market prices , they are expected to be placed in the amber box. So, they conclude, if counter-cyclical payments, when added to other ""amber"" subsidies such as marketing loanbenefits,caused U.S. spending to exceed $19.1 billion, the United States could be in violation of its world tradecommitments. Whether that would happen is unclear, in part because of the difficulty of predicting future market prices, but alsobecauseof the technicalities involved in classifying and valuing subsidies under the WTO system. ""Circuit breaker"" language in FSRIA is intended to require USDA to keep trade-distorting farm subsidies at or below the$19.1 billion limit. Questions arise about the administrative, economic, and political implications of changing (i.e.,reducing) benefits, particularly after they are announced and/or awarded. (See CRS Report RL30612(pdf) , FarmSupportPrograms and World Trade Commitments .) Some groups had argued that their own counter-cyclical policies could be designed in a way that they would not have to becounted toward the $19.1 billion limit. For example, if payments to farmers were triggered by low income (asmeasured bygross receipts for one or more commodities) rather than by low prices, they would be exempt, it has been argued. Othersdispute this assertion, noting that it is usually low prices that cause low income. The new counter-cyclical aid in the 2002 law focuses on the ""major"" commodities -- grains, cotton, oilseeds, peanuts, andmilk. These generally are the most widely produced, but that still leaves much of U.S. agriculture ineligible for suchpayments, raising questions of equity among commodities, and of the potential for distorting production towarditems thatmight receive more support (contributing to surplus production). But extending such aid to more commodities, suchasfruits, vegetables, or livestock, also would have increased federal costs, or else reduced assistance levels for themajorcommodities. Also, not all commodity groups sought such aid. For example, the National Cattlemen's BeefAssociationwas among those that opposed most forms of direct assistance, counter-cyclical or otherwise. And, the UnitedFresh Fruitand Vegetable Association argued against any subsidies that would insulate fruit or vegetable producers from marketsignals or would sustain or encourage production. Another issue was whether a new counter-cyclical program should perpetuate past patterns that tie aid to output rather thaneconomic need. Farm programs, including direct payments, marketing loans and the ad hoc ""marketloss payments,"" havebeen based on either past or current production by individual farmers, meaning that larger payments have trendedtowardlarger operations -- which do not or should not need them, critics argue. They add that if Congress intends to helpproducers in economic distress, then such recipients should have to document their need. Others counter that farmprograms are not ""welfare"" but rather part of a larger policy to ensure that U.S. agriculture remains competitive intheglobal economy (an assertion that critics challenge).","Congress has approved legislation (P.L. 107-171) reauthorizing major farmincome and commodity price support programs through crop year 2007. This legislation includes new""counter-cyclicalassistance"" programs for grains, cotton, oilseeds, peanuts, and milk. The intent of counter-cyclical assistance is toprovidemore government support when farm prices and/or incomes decline, and less support when they improve. In fact,farmershave, for many years, been eligible for various forms of counter-cyclical assistance. At issue has been the need for,andpotential impacts of, another counter-cyclical program. This report will not be updated.",govreport
